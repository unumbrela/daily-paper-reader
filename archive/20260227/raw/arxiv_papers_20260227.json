    "abstract": "We introduce MediX-R1, an open-ended Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework for medical multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that enables clinically grounded, free-form answers beyond multiple-choice formats. MediX-R1 fine-tunes a baseline vision-language backbone with Group Based RL and a composite reward tailored for medical reasoning: an LLM-based accuracy reward that judges semantic correctness with a strict YES/NO decision, a medical embedding-based semantic reward to capture paraphrases and terminology variants, and lightweight format and modality rewards that enforce interpretable reasoning and modality recognition. This multi-signal design provides stable, informative feedback for open-ended outputs where traditional verifiable or MCQ-only rewards fall short. To measure progress, we propose a unified evaluation framework for both text-only and image+text tasks that uses a Reference-based LLM-as-judge in place of brittle string-overlap metrics, capturing semantic correctness, reasoning, and contextual alignment. Despite using only $\\sim51$K instruction examples, MediX-R1 achieves excellent results across standard medical LLM (text-only) and VLM (image + text) benchmarks, outperforming strong open-source baselines and delivering particularly large gains on open-ended clinical tasks. Our results demonstrate that open-ended RL with comprehensive reward signals and LLM-based evaluation is a practical path toward reliable medical reasoning in multimodal models.

    "abstract": "We present a scalable 3D reconstruction model that addresses a critical limitation in offline feed-forward methods: their computational and memory requirements grow quadratically w.r.t. the number of input images. Our approach is built on the key insight that this bottleneck stems from the varying-length Key-Value (KV) space representation of scene geometry, which we distill into a fixed-size Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) via test-time training. VGG-T$^3$ (Visual Geometry Grounded Test Time Training) scales linearly w.r.t. the number of input views, similar to online models, and reconstructs a $1k$ image collection in just $54$ seconds, achieving a $11.6\\times$ speed-up over baselines that rely on softmax attention. Since our method retains global scene aggregation capability, our point map reconstruction error outperforming other linear-time methods by large margins. Finally, we demonstrate visual localization capabilities of our model by querying the scene representation with unseen images.",

    "title": "Model Agreement via Anchoring",
    "abstract": "Numerous lines of aim to control $\\textit{model disagreement}$ -- the extent to which two machine learning models disagree in their predictions. We adopt a simple and standard notion of model disagreement in real-valued prediction problems, namely the expected squared difference in predictions between two models trained on independent samples, without any coordination of the training processes. We would like to be able to drive disagreement to zero with some natural parameter(s) of the training procedure using analyses that can be applied to existing training methodologies.   We develop a simple general technique for proving bounds on independent model disagreement based on $\\textit{anchoring}$ to the average of two models within the analysis. We then apply this technique to prove disagreement bounds for four commonly used machine learning algorithms: (1) stacked aggregation over an arbitrary model class (where disagreement is driven to 0 with the number of models $k$ being stacked) (2) gradient boosting (where disagreement is driven to 0 with the number of iterations $k$) (3) neural network training with architecture search (where disagreement is driven to 0 with the size $n$ of the architecture being optimized over) and (4) regression tree training over all regression trees of fixed depth (where disagreement is driven to 0 with the depth $d$ of the tree architecture). For clarity, we work out our initial bounds in the setting of one-dimensional regression with squared error loss -- but then show that all of our results generalize to multi-dimensional regression with any strongly convex loss.",

    "abstract": "We identify occlusion reasoning as a fundamental yet overlooked aspect for 3D layout-conditioned generation. It is essential for synthesizing partially occluded objects with depth-consistent geometry and scale. While existing methods can generate realistic scenes that follow input layouts, they often fail to model precise inter-object occlusions. We propose SeeThrough3D, a model for 3D layout conditioned generation that explicitly models occlusions. We introduce an occlusion-aware 3D scene representation (OSCR), where objects are depicted as translucent 3D boxes placed within a virtual environment and rendered from desired camera viewpoint. The transparency encodes hidden object regions, enabling the model to reason about occlusions, while the rendered viewpoint provides explicit camera control during generation. We condition a pretrained flow based text-to-image image generation model by introducing a set of visual tokens derived from our rendered 3D representation. Furthermore, we apply masked self-attention to accurately bind each object bounding box to its corresponding textual description, enabling accurate generation of multiple objects without object attribute mixing. To train the model, we construct a synthetic dataset with diverse multi-object scenes with strong inter-object occlusions. SeeThrough3D generalizes effectively to unseen object categories and enables precise 3D layout control with realistic occlusions and consistent camera control.",

    "title": "A Dataset is Worth 1 MB",
    "abstract": "A dataset server must often distribute the same large payload to many clients, incurring massive communication costs. Since clients frequently operate on diverse hardware and software frameworks, transmitting a pre-trained model is often infeasible; instead, agents require raw data to train their own task-specific models locally. While dataset distillation attempts to compress training signals, current methods struggle to scale to high-resolution data and rarely achieve sufficiently small files. In this paper, we propose Pseudo-Labels as Data (PLADA), a method that completely eliminates pixel transmission. We assume agents are preloaded with a large, generic, unlabeled reference dataset (e.g., ImageNet-1K, ImageNet-21K) and communicate a new task by transmitting only the class labels for specific images. To address the distribution mismatch between the reference and target datasets, we introduce a pruning mechanism that filters the reference dataset to retain only the labels of the most semantically relevant images for the target task. This selection process simultaneously maximizes training efficiency and minimizes transmission payload. Experiments on 10 diverse datasets demonstrate that our approach can transfer task knowledge with a payload of less than 1 MB while retaining high classification accuracy, offering a promising solution for efficient dataset serving.",

Recent work exploits this convergence by aligning frozen pretrained vision and language models with lightweight alignment layers, but typically relies on contrastive losses and millions of paired samples. In this work, we ask whether meaningful alignment can be achieved with substantially less supervision. We introduce a semi-supervised setting in which pretrained unimodal encoders are aligned using a small number of image-text pairs together with large amounts of unpaired data. To address this challenge, we propose SOTAlign, a two-stage framework that first recovers a coarse shared geometry from limited paired data using a linear teacher, then refines the alignment on unpaired samples via an optimal-transport-based divergence that transfers relational structure without overconstraining the target space. Unlike existing semi-supervised methods, SOTAlign effectively leverages unpaired images and text, learning robust joint embeddings across datasets and encoder pairs, and significantly outperforming supervised and semi-supervised baselines.",

    "abstract": "The lack of reasoning capabilities in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has remained at the forefront of research discourse. We posit that this behavior stems from a reporting bias in their training data. That is, how people communicate about visual content by default omits tacit information needed to supervise some types of reasoning; e.g., \"at the game today!\" is a more likely caption than \"a photo of 37 people standing behind a field\". We investigate the data underlying the popular VLMs OpenCLIP, LLaVA-1.5 and Molmo through the lens of theories from pragmatics, and find that reporting bias results in insufficient representation of four reasoning skills (spatial, temporal, negation, and counting), despite the corpora being of web-scale, and/or synthetically generated. With a set of curated benchmarks, we demonstrate that: (i) VLMs perform poorly on the aforementioned types of reasoning suppressed in the training data by reporting bias; (ii) contrary to popular belief, scaling data size, model size, and to multiple languages does not result in emergence of these skills by default; but, promisingly, (iii) incorporating annotations specifically collected to obtain tacit information is effective. Our findings highlight the need for more intentional training data curation methods, rather than counting on scale for emergence of reasoning capabilities.",

    "abstract": "Standard mixed-precision training of neural networks requires many bytes of accelerator memory for each model parameter. These bytes reflect not just the parameter itself, but also its gradient and one or more optimizer state variables. With each of these values typically requiring 4 bytes, training even a 7 billion parameter model can be impractical for researchers with less than 100GB of accelerator memory.   We introduce FlashOptim, a suite of optimizations that reduces per-parameter memory by over 50% while preserving model quality and API compatibility. Our approach introduces two key techniques. First, we improve master weight splitting by finding and exploiting a tight bound on its quantization error. Second, we design companding functions that greatly reduce the error in 8-bit optimizer state quantization. Together with 16-bit gradients, these techniques reduce AdamW memory from 16 bytes to 7 bytes per parameter, or 5 bytes with gradient release. They also cut model checkpoint sizes by more than half.   Experiments with FlashOptim applied to SGD, AdamW, and Lion show no measurable quality degradation on any task from a collection of standard vision and language benchmarks, including Llama-3.1-8B finetuning.",

    "abstract": "On-disk graph-based approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) is essential for large-scale, high-dimensional vector retrieval, yet its performance is widely recognized to be limited by the prohibitive I/O costs. Interestingly, we observed that the performance of on-disk graph-based index systems is compute-bound, not I/O-bound, with the rising of the vector data dimensionality (e.g., hundreds or thousands). This insight uncovers a significant optimization opportunity: existing on-disk graph-based index systems universally target I/O reduction and largely overlook computational overhead, which leaves a substantial performance improvement space.   In this work, we propose AlayaLaser, an efficient on-disk graph-based index system for large-scale high-dimensional vector similarity search. In particular, we first conduct performance analysis on existing on-disk graph-based index systems via the adapted roofline model, then we devise a novel on-disk data layout in AlayaLaser to effectively alleviate the compute-bound, which is revealed by the above roofline model analysis, by exploiting SIMD instructions on modern CPUs. We next design a suite of optimization techniques (e.g., degree-based node cache, cluster-based entry point selection, and early dispatch strategy) to further improve the performance of AlayaLaser. We last conduct extensive experimental studies on a wide range of large-scale high-dimensional vector datasets to verify the superiority of AlayaLaser. Specifically, AlayaLaser not only surpasses existing on-disk graph-based index systems but also matches or even exceeds the performance of in-memory index systems.",

This occurs naturally through measurement rounding, sensor limitations, and lag in economic systems. We study Gaussian mean estimation from coarse data, where each true sample $x$ is drawn from a $d$-dimensional Gaussian distribution with identity covariance, but is revealed only through the set of a partition containing $x$. When the coarse samples, roughly speaking, have ``low'' information, the mean cannot be uniquely recovered from observed samples (i.e., the problem is not identifiable). Recent work by Fotakis, Kalavasis, Kontonis, and Tzamos [FKKT21] established that sample-efficient mean estimation is possible when the unknown mean is identifiable and the partition consists of only convex sets. Moreover, they showed that without convexity, mean estimation becomes NP-hard. However, two fundamental questions remained open: (1) When is the mean identifiable under convex partitions? (2) Is computationally efficient estimation possible under identifiability and convex partitions? This work resolves both questions. [...]",

    "abstract": "Open-vocabulary segmentation (OVS) extends the zero-shot recognition capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) to pixel-level prediction, enabling segmentation of arbitrary categories specified by text prompts. Despite recent progress, OVS lags behind fully supervised approaches due to two challenges: the coarse image-level supervision used to train VLMs and the semantic ambiguity of natural language. We address these limitations by introducing a few-shot setting that augments textual prompts with a support set of pixel-annotated images. Building on this, we propose a retrieval-augmented test-time adapter that learns a lightweight, per-image classifier by fusing textual and visual support features. Unlike prior methods relying on late, hand-crafted fusion, our approach performs learned, per-query fusion, achieving stronger synergy between modalities. The method supports continually expanding support sets, and applies to fine-grained tasks such as personalized segmentation. Experiments show that we significantly narrow the gap between zero-shot and supervised segmentation while preserving open-vocabulary ability.",

Using this dataset, we characterize query patterns, engagement behaviors, and how usage evolves with experience. We find that users submit longer and more complex queries than in traditional search, and treat the system as a collaborative research partner, delegating tasks such as drafting content and identifying research gaps. Users treat generated responses as persistent artifacts, revisiting and navigating among outputs and cited evidence in non-linear ways. With experience, users issue more targeted queries and engage more deeply with supporting citations, although keyword-style queries persist even among experienced users.

However, low precision leads to high accuracy loss in inference. Therefore, mixed-precision quantization becomes an alternative solution by applying different precision in different layers to trade off resource consumption and accuracy. Because regular designs for multiplication on hardware cannot support the precision reconfiguration for a multi-precision Quantized Neural Network (QNN) model in runtime, we propose a runtime reconfigurable multi-precision multi-channel bitwise systolic array design for QNN accelerators.

To address these issues, we discard VAE acoustic latents and introduce semantic encoder latents, thereby proposing SemanticVocoder, a generative vocoder that directly synthesizes waveforms from semantic latents. Equipped with SemanticVocoder, our text-to-audio generation model achieves a Frechet Distance of 12.823 and a Frechet Audio Distance of 1.709 on the AudioCaps test set, as the introduced semantic latents exhibit superior discriminability compared to acoustic VAE latents. Beyond improved generation performance, it also serves as a promising attempt towards unifying audio understanding and generation within a shared semantic space.

However, most of this work focuses on widely-used general purpose programming languages like Python due to their widespread usage training data. The utility of LLMs for software within the industrial process automation domain, with highly-specialized languages that are typically only used in proprietary contexts, remains underexplored.

    "abstract": "The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has accelerated the development of autonomous financial trading systems. While mainstream approaches deploy multi-agent systems mimicking analyst and manager roles, they often rely on abstract instructions that overlook the intricacies of real-world workflows, which can lead to degraded inference performance and less transparent decision-making. Therefore, we propose a multi-agent LLM trading framework that explicitly decomposes investment analysis into fine-grained tasks, rather than providing coarse-grained instructions. We evaluate the proposed framework using Japanese stock data, including prices, financial statements, news, and macro information, under a leakage-controlled backtesting setting. Experimental results show that fine-grained task decomposition significantly improves risk-adjusted returns compared to conventional coarse-grained designs. Crucially, further analysis of intermediate agent outputs suggests that alignment between analytical outputs and downstream decision preferences is a critical driver of system performance. Moreover, we conduct standard portfolio optimization, exploiting low correlation with the stock index and the variance of each system's output. This approach achieves superior performance. These findings contribute to the design of agent structure and task configuration when applying LLM agents to trading systems in practical settings.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) perform increasingly well on biology benchmarks, but it remains unclear whether they uplift novice users -- i.e., enable humans to perform better than with internet-only resources. This uncertainty is central to understanding both scientific acceleration and dual-use risk. We conducted a multi-model, multi-benchmark human uplift study comparing novices with LLM access versus internet-only access across eight biosecurity-relevant task sets. Participants worked on complex problems with ample time (up to 13 hours for the most involved tasks). We found that LLM access provided substantial uplift: novices with LLMs were 4.16 times more accurate than controls (95% CI [2.63, 6.87]). On four benchmarks with available expert baselines (internet-only), novices with LLMs outperformed experts on three of them. Perhaps surprisingly, standalone LLMs often exceeded LLM-assisted novices, indicating that users were not eliciting the strongest available contributions from the LLMs. Most participants (89.6%) reported little difficulty obtaining dual-use-relevant information despite safeguards. Overall, LLMs substantially uplift novices on biological tasks previously reserved for trained practitioners, underscoring the need for sustained, interactive uplift evaluations alongside traditional benchmarks.",

In our approach, triggered antennas are represented as a graph structure, which serves as input for a graph neural network (GNN). By incorporating physical knowledge into both the GNN architecture and the input data, we improve the precision and reduce the required size of the training set with respect to a fully data-driven approach. This method achieves an angular resolution of 0.092° and an electromagnetic energy reconstruction resolution of 16.4% on simulated data with realistic noise conditions.   We also employ uncertainty estimation methods to enhance the reliability of our predictions, quantifying the confidence of the GNN's outputs and providing confidence intervals for both direction and energy reconstruction. Finally, we investigate strategies to verify the model's consistency and robustness under real life variations, with the goal of identifying scenarios in which predictions remain reliable despite domain shifts between simulation and reality.",

Recent studies have attempted to address this limitation through various approaches, among which increasing reflective diversity has shown promise. Our empirical analysis reveals a strong positive correlation between reflective diversity and task success, further motivating the need for diverse reflection signals. We introduce ParamMem, a parametric memory module that encodes cross-sample reflection patterns into model parameters, enabling diverse reflection generation through temperature-controlled sampling. Building on this module, we propose ParamAgent, a reflection-based agent framework that integrates parametric memory with episodic and cross-sample memory. Extensive experiments on code generation, mathematical reasoning, and multi-hop question answering demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines. Further analysis reveals that ParamMem is sample-efficient, enables weak-to-strong transfer across model scales, and supports self-improvement without reliance on stronger external model, highlighting the potential of ParamMem as an effective component for enhancing language agents.",

Once designed and well trained, the AI model is applied for inference. However, even optimized AI models can produce inference errors due to aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. Interestingly, we observed that when inferring multiple samples based on invariant transformations of an input, inference errors can show partial independences due to epistemic uncertainty. Leveraging this insight, we propose a \"resampling\" based inferencing that applies to a trained AI model with multiple transformed versions of an input, and aggregates inference outputs to a more accurate result. This approach has the potential to improve inference accuracy and offers a strategy for balancing model size and performance.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents an adaptive sampling algorithm tailored for the optimization of parametrized dynamical systems using projection-based model order reduction. Unlike classical sampling strategies, this framework does not aim for a small approximation error in the global sense but focuses on identifying and refining promising regions early on while reducing expensive full order model evaluations. The algorithm is tested on two models: a Timoshenko beam and a Kelvin cell, which ought to be optimized in terms of the system output in the frequency domain. For that, different norms of the transfer function are used as the objective function, while up to two geometrical parameters form the vector of design variables. The sampled full order models are reduced using the iterative rational Krylov algorithm and reprojected into a global basis. Subsequently, the models are parametrized by performing sparse Bayesian regression on matrix entry level of the reduced operators. Thompson sampling is carried out using the posterior distribution of the polynomial coefficients in order to account for uncertainties in the trained regression models. The strategy deployed for sample acquisition incorporates a gradient-based search on the parametrized reduced order model, which involves analytical gradients obtained via adjoint sensitivity analysis. By adding the found optimum to the sample set, the sample set is iteratively refined. Results demonstrate robust convergence towards the global optimum but highlight the computational cost introduced by the gradient-based optimization. The probabilistic extensions seamlessly integrate into existing matrix-interpolatory reduction frameworks and enable the analytical calculation of gradients under uncertainty.",

    "abstract": "Leader-follower interaction is an important paradigm in human-robot interaction (HRI). Yet, assigning roles in real time remains challenging for resource-constrained mobile and assistive robots. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for natural communication, their size and latency limit on-device deployment. Small language models (SLMs) offer a potential alternative, but their effectiveness for role classification in HRI has not been systematically evaluated. In this paper, we present a benchmark of SLMs for leader-follower communication, introducing a novel dataset derived from a published database and augmented with synthetic samples to capture interaction-specific dynamics. We investigate two adaptation strategies: prompt engineering and fine-tuning, studied under zero-shot and one-shot interaction modes, compared with an untrained baseline. Experiments with Qwen2.5-0.5B reveal that zero-shot fine-tuning achieves robust classification performance (86.66% accuracy) while maintaining low latency (22.2 ms per sample), significantly outperforming baseline and prompt-engineered approaches. However, results also indicate a performance degradation in one-shot modes, where increased context length challenges the model's architectural capacity. These findings demonstrate that fine-tuned SLMs provide an effective solution for direct role assignment, while highlighting critical trade-offs between dialogue complexity and classification reliability on the edge.",

While existing omni-modal large language models (OLLM) excel at perceiving diverse modalities, they lack the complex reasoning abilities of recent large reasoning models (LRM).

To address these limitations, we propose ThinkOmni, a training-free and data-free framework that lifts textual reasoning to omni-modal scenarios. ThinkOmni introduces two key components: 1) LRM-as-a-Guide, which leverages off-the-shelf LRMs to guide the OLLM decoding process; 2) Stepwise Contrastive Scaling, which adaptively balances perception and reasoning signals without manual hyperparameter tuning. Experiments on six multi-modal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that ThinkOmni consistently delivers performance improvements, with main results achieving 70.2 on MathVista and 75.5 on MMAU. Overall, ThinkOmni offers a flexible and generalizable solution for omni-modal reasoning and provides new insights into the generalization and application of reasoning capabilities.",

Impressive progress has been made through ML and AI techniques with regards to large data set processing. This progress has increased the ability of the experimenter to digest data and make novel predictions regarding phenomena of interest. However, machine learning predictors generated from data sets taken from the natural sciences are often treated as black boxes which are used broadly and generally without detailed consideration of the causal structure of the data set of interest. Work has been attempted to bring causality into discussions of machine learning models of natural phenomena; however, a firm and unified theoretical treatment is lacking. This series of three papers explores the union of chemical theory, biological theory, probability theory and causality that will correct current causal flaws of machine learning in the natural sciences. This paper, Part 1 of the series, provides the formal framework of the foundational causal structure of phenomena in chemical biology and is extended to machine learning through the novel concept of focus, defined here as the ability of a machine learning algorithm to narrow down to a hidden underpinning mechanism in large data sets. Initial proof of these principles on a family of Akt inhibitors is also provided. The second paper containing Part 2 will provide a formal exploration of chemical similarity, and Part 3 will present extensive experimental evidence of how hidden causal structures weaken all machine learning in chemical biology. This series serves to establish for chemical biology a new kind of mathematical framework for modeling mechanisms in Nature without the need for the tools of reductionism: inferential mechanics.",

We propose Mixture of Speech-Text Experts for Recognition of Emotions (MiSTER-E), a modular Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework designed to decouple two core challenges in ERC: modality-specific context modeling and multimodal information fusion. MiSTER-E leverages large language models (LLMs) fine-tuned for both speech and text to provide rich utterance-level embeddings, which are then enhanced through a convolutional-recurrent context modeling layer. The system integrates predictions from three experts-speech-only, text-only, and cross-modal-using a learned gating mechanism that dynamically weighs their outputs. To further encourage consistency and alignment across modalities, we introduce a supervised contrastive loss between paired speech-text representations and a KL-divergence-based regulariza-tion across expert predictions. Importantly, MiSTER-E does not rely on speaker identity at any stage. Experiments on three benchmark datasets-IEMOCAP, MELD, and MOSI-show that our proposal achieves 70.9%, 69.5%, and 87.9% weighted F1-scores respectively, outperforming several baseline speech-text ERC systems.

We first curate an expert corpus of risk-disease correlations via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to refine Clinical ModernBERT, embedding diagnostic priors into the text encoder. To bridge the modality gap, we introduce a dual-encoder pre-training strategy utilizing DINOv3 and our refined BERT, optimized by a suite of four complementary loss functions. These losses are designed to capture multi-granular semantic alignment and handle the ambiguity of clinical correlations through soft labels. Finally, we leverage Qwen-3 to fuse these aligned features for precise disease classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PRIMA effectively harmonizes pixel-level features with abstract clinical expertise, significantly outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.

Existing federated UQ approaches often address data heterogeneity or model heterogeneity in isolation, overlooking their joint effect on coverage reliability across agents. Conformal prediction is a widely used distribution-free UQ framework, yet its applications in heterogeneous FL settings remains underexplored. We provide FedWQ-CP, a simple yet effective approach that balances empirical coverage performance with efficiency at both global and agent levels under the dual heterogeneity. FedWQ-CP performs agent-server calibration in a single communication round. On each agent, conformity scores are computed on calibration data and a local quantile threshold is derived. Each agent then transmits only its quantile threshold and calibration sample size to the server. The server simply aggregates these thresholds through a weighted average to produce a global threshold. Experimental results on seven public datasets for both classification and regression demonstrate that FedWQ-CP empirically maintains agent-wise and global coverage while producing the smallest prediction sets or intervals.",

    "title": "ManifoldGD: Training-Free Hierarchical Manifold Guidance for Diffusion-Based Dataset Distillation",
    "abstract": "In recent times, large datasets hinder efficient model training while also containing redundant concepts. Dataset distillation aims to synthesize compact datasets that preserve the knowledge of large-scale training sets while drastically reducing storage and computation. Recent advances in diffusion models have enabled training-free distillation by leveraging pre-trained generative priors; however, existing guidance strategies remain limited. Current score-based methods either perform unguided denoising or rely on simple mode-based guidance toward instance prototype centroids (IPC centroids), which often are rudimentary and suboptimal. We propose Manifold-Guided Distillation (ManifoldGD), a training-free diffusion-based framework that integrates manifold consistent guidance at every denoising timestep. Our method employs IPCs computed via a hierarchical, divisive clustering of VAE latent features, yielding a multi-scale coreset of IPCs that captures both coarse semantic modes and fine intra-class variability. Using a local neighborhood of the extracted IPC centroids, we create the latent manifold for each diffusion denoising timestep. At each denoising step, we project the mode-alignment vector onto the local tangent space of the estimated latent manifold, thus constraining the generation trajectory to remain manifold-faithful while preserving semantic consistency. This formulation improves representativeness, diversity, and image fidelity without requiring any model retraining. Empirical results demonstrate consistent gains over existing training-free and training-based baselines in terms of FID, l2 distance among real and synthetic dataset embeddings, and classification accuracy, establishing ManifoldGD as the first geometry-aware training-free data distillation framework.",

    "title": "Towards Long-Form Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding",
    "abstract": "In real scenarios, videos can span several minutes or even hours. However, existing research on spatio-temporal video grounding (STVG), given a textual query, mainly focuses on localizing targets in short videos of tens of seconds, typically less than one minute, which limits real-world applications. In this paper, we explore Long-Form STVG (LF-STVG), which aims to locate targets in long-term videos. Compared with short videos, long-term videos contain much longer temporal spans and more irrelevant information, making it difficult for existing STVG methods that process all frames at once. To address this challenge, we propose an AutoRegressive Transformer architecture for LF-STVG, termed ART-STVG. Unlike conventional STVG methods that require the entire video sequence to make predictions at once, ART-STVG treats the video as streaming input and processes frames sequentially, enabling efficient handling of long videos. To model spatio-temporal context, we design spatial and temporal memory banks and apply them to the decoders. Since memories from different moments are not always relevant to the current frame, we introduce simple yet effective memory selection strategies to provide more relevant information to the decoders, significantly improving performance. Furthermore, instead of parallel spatial and temporal localization, we propose a cascaded spatio-temporal design that connects the spatial decoder to the temporal decoder, allowing fine-grained spatial cues to assist complex temporal localization in long videos. Experiments on newly extended LF-STVG datasets show that ART-STVG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, while achieving competitive performance on conventional short-form STVG.",

    "abstract": "Consider a marketplace of AI tools, each with slightly different strengths and weaknesses. By selecting the right model for the task at hand, a user can do better than simply committing to a single model for everything. Routers operate under a similar principle, where sophisticated model selection can increase overall performance. However, aggregation is often noisy, reflecting in imperfect user choices or routing decisions. This leads to two main questions: first, what does a \"healthy marketplace\" of models look like for maximizing consumer utility? Secondly, how can we incentivize producers to create such models? Here, we study two types of model changes: market entry (where an entirely new model is created and added to the set of available models), and model replacement (where an existing model has its strengths and weaknesses changed). We show that winrate, a standard benchmark in LLM evaluation, can incentivize model creators to homogenize for both types of model changes, reducing consumer welfare. We propose a new mechanism, weighted winrate, which rewards models for answers that are higher quality, and show that it provably improves incentives for producers to specialize and increases consumer welfare. We conclude by demonstrating that our theoretical results generalize to empirical benchmark datasets and discussing implications for evaluation design.",

    "abstract": "Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining enables precise molecular profiling of protein expression, with over 200 clinically available antibody-based tests in modern pathology. However, comprehensive IHC analysis is frequently limited by insufficient tissue quantities in small biopsies. Therefore, virtual multiplex staining emerges as an innovative solution to digitally transform H&E images into multiple IHC representations, yet current methods still face three critical challenges: (1) inadequate semantic guidance for multi-staining, (2) inconsistent distribution of immunochemistry staining, and (3) spatial misalignment across different stain modalities. To overcome these limitations, we present a prompt-guided framework for virtual multiplex IHC staining using only uniplex training data (PGVMS). Our framework introduces three key innovations corresponding to each challenge: First, an adaptive prompt guidance mechanism employing a pathological visual language model dynamically adjusts staining prompts to resolve semantic guidance limitations (Challenge 1). Second, our protein-aware learning strategy (PALS) maintains precise protein expression patterns by direct quantification and constraint of protein distributions (Challenge 2). Third, the prototype-consistent learning strategy (PCLS) establishes cross-image semantic interaction to correct spatial misalignments (Challenge 3).",

    "abstract": "The accurate and automatic extraction of roads from satellite imagery is critical for applications in navigation and urban planning, significantly reducing the need for manual annotation. Many existing methods decompose this task into keypoint extraction and connectedness prediction, but often struggle to capture long-range dependencies and complex topologies. Here, we propose LineGraph2Road, a framework that improves connectedness prediction by formulating it as binary classification over edges in a constructed global but sparse Euclidean graph, where nodes are keypoints extracted from segmentation masks and edges connect node pairs within a predefined distance threshold, representing potential road segments. To better learn structural link representation, we transform the original graph into its corresponding line graph and apply a Graph Transformer on it for connectedness prediction. This formulation overcomes the limitations of endpoint-embedding fusion on set-isomorphic links, enabling rich link representations and effective relational reasoning over the global structure. Additionally, we introduce an overpass/underpass head to resolve multi-level crossings and a coupled NMS strategy to preserve critical connections. We evaluate LineGraph2Road on three benchmarks: City-scale, SpaceNet, and Global-scale, and show that it achieves state-of-the-art results on two key metrics, TOPO-F1 and APLS. It also captures fine visual details critical for real-world deployment. We will make our code publicly available.",

Maintaining data clustering in a large-scale table is crucial for effective data pruning. Existing automatic clustering approaches lack the flexibility required in dynamic cloud environments with continuous data ingestion and evolving workloads. This paper advocates a clean separation between reclustering policy and clustering-key selection. We introduce the concept of boundary micro-partitions that sit on the boundary of query ranges. We then present WAIR, a workload-aware algorithm to identify and recluster only boundary micro-partitions most critical for pruning efficiency. WAIR achieves near-optimal (with respect to fully sorted table layouts) query performance but incurs significantly lower reclustering cost with a theoretical upper bound. We further implement the algorithm into a prototype reclustering service and evaluate on standard benchmarks (TPC-H, DSB) and a real-world workload. Results show that WAIR improves query performance and reduces the overall cost compared to existing solutions.",

Often, these users control high-DoF robots through low-dimensional interfaces, such as using a 1-D sip-and-puff interface to operate a 6-DoF robotic arm. This mismatch results in having access to only a subset of control dimensions at a given time, imposing unintended and artificial constraints on robot motion. As a result, interface-limited demonstrations embed suboptimal motions that reflect interface restrictions rather than user intent. To address this, we present a trajectory reconstruction algorithm that reasons about task, environment, and interface constraints to lift demonstrations into the robot's full control space. We evaluate our approach using real-world demonstrations of ADL-inspired tasks performed via a 2-D joystick and 1-D sip-and-puff control interface, teleoperating two distinct 7-DoF robotic arms. Analyses of the reconstructed demonstrations and derived control policies show that lifted trajectories are faster and more efficient than their interface-constrained counterparts while respecting user preferences.",

    "abstract": "Real-world Table-Text question answering (QA) tasks require models that can reason across long text and source tables, traversing multiple hops and executing complex operations such as aggregation. Yet existing benchmarks are small, manually curated - and therefore error-prone - and contain shallow questions that seldom demand more than two hops or invoke aggregations, grouping, or other advanced analytical operations expressible in natural-language queries. We present SPARTA, an end-to-end construction framework that automatically generates large-scale Table-Text QA benchmarks with lightweight human validation, requiring only one quarter of the annotation time of HybridQA. The framework first constructs a reference fact database by enriching each source table with grounding tables whose tuples are atomic facts automatically extracted from the accompanying unstructured passages, then synthesizes nested queries whose number of nested predicates matches the desired hop count. To ensure that every SQL statement is executable and that its verbalization yields a fluent, human-sounding question, we propose two novel techniques: provenance-based refinement, which rewrites any syntactically valid query that returns a non-empty result, and realistic-structure enforcement, which confines generation to post-order traversals of the query graph. The resulting pipeline produces thousands of high-fidelity question-answer pairs covering aggregations, grouping, and deep multi-hop reasoning across text and tables. On SPARTA, state-of-the-art models that reach over 70 F1 on HybridQA or over 50 F1 on OTT-QA drop by more than 30 F1 points, exposing fundamental weaknesses in current cross-modal reasoning.

Existing modeling approaches are often computationally expensive and impractical for complex control or reinforcement learning needed for realistic motions to emerge in robotic systems. In this work, we present a tendon-driven fish robot modeled in an efficient underwater swimmer environment using a simplified, stateless hydrodynamics formulation implemented in the widespread robotics framework MuJoCo. With just two real-world swimming trajectories, we identify five fluid parameters that allow a matching to experimental behavior and generalize across a range of actuation frequencies. We show that this stateless fluid model can generalize to unseen actuation and outperform classical analytical models such as the elongated body theory. This simulation environment runs faster than real-time and can easily enable downstream learning algorithms such as reinforcement learning for target tracking, reaching a 93% success rate. Due to the simplicity and ease of use of the model and our open-source simulation environment, our results show that even simple, stateless models -- when carefully matched to physical data -- can serve as effective digital twins for soft underwater robots, opening up new directions for scalable learning and control in aquatic environments.",

However, accurate value estimation remains a challenge due to the limited coverage of the state-action space. Recent physics-informed approaches have sought to address this by imposing physical and geometric constraints on the value function through regularization defined over first-order partial differential equations (PDEs), such as the Eikonal equation. However, these formulations can often be ill-posed in complex, high-dimensional environments. In this work, we propose a physics-informed regularization derived from the viscosity solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. By providing a physics-based inductive bias, our approach grounds the learning process in optimal control theory, explicitly regularizing and bounding updates during value iterations. Furthermore, we leverage the Feynman-Kac theorem to recast the PDE solution as an expectation, enabling a tractable Monte Carlo estimation of the objective that avoids numerical instability in higher-order gradients. Experiments demonstrate that our method improves geometric consistency, making it broadly applicable to navigation and high-dimensional, complex manipulation tasks.

Using survey data from 2,257 employees in a global consulting firm, we test whether psychological safety is associated with adoption, usage frequency, and usage duration; and whether these relationships vary by organizational level, professional experience, or geographic region. Logistic and linear regression analyses show that psychological safety reliably predicts whether employees adopt AI tools but does not predict how often or how long they use AI once adoption has occurred. Moreover, the relationship between psychological safety and AI adoption is consistent across experience levels, role levels, and regions, and no moderation effects emerge. These findings suggest that psychological safety functions as a key antecedent of initial AI engagement but not of subsequent usage intensity. The study underscores the need to distinguish between adoption and sustained use and highlights opportunities for targeted organizational interventions in early-stage AI implementation.",

Across models, job design, especially skill variety and autonomy, showed the most consistent positive associations with AI adoption, whereas threat dimensions exhibited differentiated patterns for depth of use. Perceived changes in work were positively associated with frequency and duration, while status threat showed a negative but not consistently significant relationship with deeper use.

    "abstract": "We study Stackelberg (leader--follower) tuning of network parameters (tolls, capacities, incentives) in combinatorial congestion games, where selfish users choose discrete routes (or other combinatorial strategies) and settle at a congestion equilibrium. The leader minimizes a system-level objective (e.g., total travel time) evaluated at equilibrium, but this objective is typically nonsmooth because the set of used strategies can change abruptly. We propose ZO-Stackelberg, which couples a projection-free Frank--Wolfe equilibrium solver with a zeroth-order outer update, avoiding differentiation through equilibria. We prove convergence to generalized Goldstein stationary points of the true equilibrium objective, with explicit dependence on the equilibrium approximation error, and analyze subsampled oracles: if an exact minimizer is sampled with probability $κ_m$, then the Frank--Wolfe error decays as $\\mathcal{O}(1/(κ_m T))$. We also propose stratified sampling as a practical way to avoid a vanishing $κ_m$ when the strategies that matter most for the Wardrop equilibrium concentrate in a few dominant combinatorial classes (e.g., short paths). Experiments on real-world networks demonstrate that our method achieves orders-of-magnitude speedups over a differentiation-based baseline while converging to follower equilibria.",

    "abstract": "Chest X-ray plays a central role in thoracic diagnosis, and its interpretation inherently requires multi-step, evidence-grounded reasoning. However, large vision-language models (LVLMs) often generate plausible responses that are not faithfully grounded in diagnostic evidence and provide limited visual evidence for verification, while also requiring costly retraining to support new diagnostic tasks, limiting their reliability and adaptability in clinical settings. To address these limitations, we present CXReasonAgent, a diagnostic agent that integrates a large language model (LLM) with clinically grounded diagnostic tools to perform evidence-grounded diagnostic reasoning using image-derived diagnostic and visual evidence. To evaluate these capabilities, we introduce CXReasonDial, a multi-turn dialogue benchmark with 1,946 dialogues across 12 diagnostic tasks, and show that CXReasonAgent produces faithfully grounded responses, enabling more reliable and verifiable diagnostic reasoning than LVLMs. These findings highlight the importance of integrating clinically grounded diagnostic tools, particularly in safety-critical clinical settings.",

    "title": "Exploiting network topology in brain-scale simulations of spiking neural networks",
    "abstract": "Simulation code for conventional supercomputers serves as a reference for neuromorphic computing systems. The present bottleneck of distributed large-scale spiking neuronal network simulations is the communication between compute nodes. Communication speed seems limited by the interconnect between the nodes and the software library orchestrating the data transfer. Profiling reveals, however, that the variability of the time required by the compute nodes between communication calls is large. The bottleneck is in fact the waiting time for the slowest node. A statistical model explains total simulation time on the basis of the distribution of computation times between communication calls. A fundamental cure is to avoid communication calls because this requires fewer synchronizations and reduces the variability of computation times across compute nodes. The organization of the mammalian brain into areas lends itself to such an optimization strategy. Connections between neurons within an area have short delays, but the delays of the long-range connections across areas are an order of magnitude longer. This suggests a structure-aware mapping of areas to compute nodes allowing for a partition into more frequent communication between nodes simulating a particular area and less frequent global communication. We demonstrate a substantial performance gain on a real-world example. This work proposes a local-global hybrid communication architecture for large-scale neuronal network simulations as a first step in mapping the structure of the brain to the structure of a supercomputer. It challenges the long-standing belief that the bottleneck of simulation is synchronization inherent in the collective calls of standard communication libraries. We provide guidelines for the energy efficient simulation of neuronal networks on conventional computing systems and raise the bar for neuromorphic systems.",

    "title": "Evaluating Stochasticity in Deep Research Agents",
    "abstract": "Deep Research Agents (DRAs) are promising agentic systems that gather and synthesize information to support research across domains such as financial decision-making, medical analysis, and scientific discovery. Despite recent improvements in research quality (e.g., outcome accuracy when ground truth is available), DRA system design often overlooks a critical barrier to real-world deployment: stochasticity. Under identical queries, repeated executions of DRAs can exhibit substantial variability in terms of research outcome, findings, and citations. In this paper, we formalize the study of stochasticity in DRAs by modeling them as information acquisition Markov Decision Processes. We introduce an evaluation framework that quantifies variance in the system and identify three sources of it: information acquisition, information compression, and inference. Through controlled experiments, we investigate how stochasticity from these modules across different decision steps influences the variance of DRA outputs. Our results show that reducing stochasticity can improve research output quality, with inference and early-stage stochasticity contributing the most to DRA output variance. Based on these findings, we propose strategies for mitigating stochasticity while maintaining output quality via structured output and ensemble-based query generation. Our experiments on DeepSearchQA show that our proposed mitigation methods reduce average stochasticity by 22% while maintaining high research quality.",

    "abstract": "Achieving human-like responsiveness is a critical yet challenging goal for cascaded spoken dialogue systems. Conventional ASR-LLM-TTS pipelines follow a strictly sequential paradigm, requiring complete transcription and full reasoning before speech synthesis can begin, which results in high response latency. We propose the Discourse-Aware Dual-Track Streaming Response (DDTSR) framework, a low-latency architecture that enables listen-while-thinking and speak-while-thinking. DDTSR is built upon three key mechanisms: (1) connective-guided small-large model synergy, where an auxiliary small model generates minimal-committal discourse connectives while a large model performs knowledge-intensive reasoning in parallel; (2) streaming-based cross-modal collaboration, which dynamically overlaps ASR, LLM inference, and TTS to advance the earliest speakable moment; and (3) curriculum-learning-based discourse continuity enhancement, which maintains coherence and logical consistency between early responses and subsequent reasoning outputs. Experiments on two spoken dialogue benchmarks demonstrate that DDTSR reduces response latency by 19%-51% while preserving discourse quality. Further analysis shows that DDTSR functions as a plug-and-play module compatible with diverse LLM backbones, and remains robust across varying utterance lengths, indicating strong practicality and scalability for real-time spoken interaction.",

Results showed the shoulder-mounted camera achieved the highest accuracy (85%), though differences between positions were not statistically significant. Participants noted that peripheral distortion in 360-degree videos impacted clarity, highlighting areas for improvement. Despite challenges, the overall comprehension success rate of 83.3% demonstrates the potential of video-based ASL communication in VR.

    "abstract": "Generative models trained on sensitive image datasets risk memorizing and reproducing individual training examples, making strong privacy guarantees essential. While differential privacy (DP) provides a principled framework for such guarantees, standard DP finetuning (e.g., with DP-SGD) often results in severe degradation of image quality, particularly in high-frequency textures, due to the indiscriminate addition of noise across all model parameters. In this work, we propose a spectral DP framework based on the hypothesis that the most privacy-sensitive portions of an image are often low-frequency components in the wavelet space (e.g., facial features and object shapes) while high-frequency components are largely generic and public. Based on this hypothesis, we propose the following two-stage framework for DP image generation with coarse image intermediaries: (1) DP finetune an autoregressive spectral image tokenizer model on the low-resolution wavelet coefficients of the sensitive images, and (2) perform high-resolution upsampling using a publicly pretrained super-resolution model. By restricting the privacy budget to the global structures of the image in the first stage, and leveraging the post-processing property of DP for detail refinement, we achieve promising trade-offs between privacy and utility. Experiments on the MS-COCO and MM-CelebA-HQ datasets show that our method generates images with improved quality and style capture relative to other leading DP image frameworks.",

    "abstract": "Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is a foundational cryptographic protocol that ensures information-theoretic security. However, classical protocols such as BB84, though favored for their simplicity, offer limited resistance to eavesdropping, and perform poorly under realistic noise conditions. Recent research has explored the use of discrete-time Quantum Walks (QWs) to enhance QKD schemes. In this work, we specifically focus on a one-way QKD protocol, where security depends exclusively on the underlying Quantum Walk (QW) topology, rather than the details of the protocol itself. Our paper introduces a novel protocol based on QWs over a hypercube topology and demonstrates that, under identical parameters, it provides significantly enhanced security and noise resistance compared to the circular topology (i.e., state-of-the-art), thereby strengthening protection against eavesdropping. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient and extensible simulation framework for one-way QKD protocols based on QWs, supporting both circular and hypercube topologies. Implemented with IBM's software development kit for quantum computing (i.e., Qiskit), our toolkit enables noise-aware analysis under realistic noise models. To support reproducibility and future developments, we release our entire simulation framework as open-source. This contribution establishes a foundation for the design of topology-aware QKD protocols that combine enhanced noise tolerance with topologically driven security.",

    "abstract": "With advances in imitation learning (IL) and large-scale driving datasets, end-to-end autonomous driving (E2E-AD) has made great progress recently. Currently, IL-based methods have become a mainstream paradigm: models rely on standard driving behaviors given by experts, and learn to minimize the discrepancy between their actions and expert actions. However, this objective of \"only driving like the expert\" suffers from limited generalization: when encountering rare or unseen long-tail scenarios outside the distribution of expert demonstrations, models tend to produce unsafe decisions in the absence of prior experience. This raises a fundamental question: Can an E2E-AD system make reliable decisions without any expert action supervision? Motivated by this, we propose a unified framework named Risk-aware World Model Predictive Control (RaWMPC) to address this generalization dilemma through robust control, without reliance on expert demonstrations. Practically, RaWMPC leverages a world model to predict the consequences of multiple candidate actions and selects low-risk actions through explicit risk evaluation. To endow the world model with the ability to predict the outcomes of risky driving behaviors, we design a risk-aware interaction strategy that systematically exposes the world model to hazardous behaviors, making catastrophic outcomes predictable and thus avoidable. Furthermore, to generate low-risk candidate actions at test time, we introduce a self-evaluation distillation method to distill riskavoidance capabilities from the well-trained world model into a generative action proposal network without any expert demonstration. Extensive experiments show that RaWMPC outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios, while providing superior decision interpretability.",

    "abstract": "While Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) excel in complex reasoning, they suffer from the cascading impact of erroneous information generated by individual participants. Current solutions often resort to rigid structural engineering or expensive fine-tuning, limiting their deployability and adaptability. We propose AgentDropoutV2, a test-time rectify-or-reject pruning framework designed to dynamically optimize MAS information flow without retraining. Our approach acts as an active firewall, intercepting agent outputs and employing a retrieval-augmented rectifier to iteratively correct errors based on a failure-driven indicator pool. This mechanism allows for the precise identification of potential errors using distilled failure patterns as prior knowledge. Irreparable outputs are subsequently pruned to prevent error propagation, while a fallback strategy preserves system integrity. Empirical results on extensive math benchmarks show that AgentDropoutV2 significantly boosts the MAS's task performance, achieving an average accuracy gain of 6.3 percentage points on math benchmarks. Furthermore, the system exhibits robust generalization and adaptivity, dynamically modulating rectification efforts based on task difficulty while leveraging context-aware indicators to resolve a wide spectrum of error patterns.

    "abstract": "Robotic assembly presents a long-standing challenge due to its requirement for precise, contact-rich manipulation. While simulation-based learning has enabled the development of robust assembly policies, their performance often degrades when deployed in real-world settings due to the sim-to-real gap. Conversely, real-world reinforcement learning (RL) methods avoid the sim-to-real gap, but rely heavily on human supervision and lack generalization ability to environmental changes. In this work, we propose a hybrid approach that combines a simulation-trained base policy with a real-world residual policy to efficiently adapt to real-world variations. The base policy, trained in simulation using low-level state observations and dense rewards, provides strong priors for initial behavior. The residual policy, learned in the real world using visual observations and sparse rewards, compensates for discrepancies in dynamics and sensor noise. Extensive real-world experiments demonstrate that our method, SPARR, achieves near-perfect success rates across diverse two-part assembly tasks. Compared to the state-of-the-art zero-shot sim-to-real methods, SPARR improves success rates by 38.4% while reducing cycle time by 29.7%. Moreover, SPARR requires no human expertise, in contrast to the state-of-the-art real-world RL approaches that depend heavily on human supervision.",

The law requires that quantization noise be approximately white, a condition whose minimum bit depth $N_{\\min}$ we show to be $α$-dependent. Validation on synthetic $1/f^α$ signals for $α\\in \\{1.5, 2.0, 2.5\\}$ yields prediction errors below 3\\% using the theoretical noise floor $Δ^2/(6f_s)$, and approximately 14\\% when the noise floor is estimated empirically from the quantized signal's spectrum.

We propose a solution by decoupling the correctness from the checkability condition and instead training a \"translator\" model that turns a fixed solver model's solution into a checkable form. This allows us to first train the solver to maximize correctness, and then train the translator to translate the solver into a checkable form while retaining the solver's answer.

    "title": "Agency and Architectural Limits: Why Optimization-Based Systems Cannot Be Norm-Responsive",
    "abstract": "AI systems are increasingly deployed in high-stakes contexts -- medical diagnosis, legal research, financial analysis -- under the assumption they can be governed by norms. This paper demonstrates that assumption is formally invalid for optimization-based systems, specifically Large Language Models trained via Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). We establish that genuine agency requires two necessary and jointly sufficient architectural conditions: the capacity to maintain certain boundaries as non-negotiable constraints rather than tradeable weights (Incommensurability), and a non-inferential mechanism capable of suspending processing when those boundaries are threatened (Apophatic Responsiveness). These conditions apply across all normative domains.   RLHF-based systems are constitutively incompatible with both conditions. The operations that make optimization powerful -- unifying all values on a scalar metric and always selecting the highest-scoring output -- are precisely the operations that preclude normative governance. This incompatibility is not a correctable training bug awaiting a technical fix; it is a formal constraint inherent to what optimization is. Consequently, documented failure modes - sycophancy, hallucination, and unfaithful reasoning - are not accidents but structural manifestations.   Misaligned deployment triggers a second-order risk we term the Convergence Crisis: when humans are forced to verify AI outputs under metric pressure, they degrade from genuine agents into criteria-checking optimizers, eliminating the only component in the system capable of normative accountability. Beyond the incompatibility proof, the paper's primary positive contribution is a substrate-neutral architectural specification defining what any system -- biological, artificial, or institutional -- must satisfy to qualify as an agent rather than a sophisticated instrument.",

    "title": "Spatio-Temporal Token Pruning for Efficient High-Resolution GUI Agents",
    "abstract": "Pure-vision GUI agents provide universal interaction capabilities but suffer from severe efficiency bottlenecks due to the massive spatiotemporal redundancy inherent in high-resolution screenshots and historical trajectories. We identify two critical misalignments in existing compression paradigms: the temporal mismatch, where uniform history encoding diverges from the agent's \"fading memory\" attention pattern, and the spatial topology conflict, where unstructured pruning compromises the grid integrity required for precise coordinate grounding, inducing spatial hallucinations. To address these challenges, we introduce GUIPruner, a training-free framework tailored for high-resolution GUI navigation. It synergizes Temporal-Adaptive Resolution (TAR), which eliminates historical redundancy via decay-based resizing, and Stratified Structure-aware Pruning (SSP), which prioritizes interactive foregrounds and semantic anchors while safeguarding global layout. Extensive evaluations across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that GUIPruner consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively preventing the collapse observed in large-scale models under high compression. Notably, on Qwen2-VL-2B, our method delivers a 3.4x reduction in FLOPs and a 3.3x speedup in vision encoding latency while retaining over 94% of the original performance, enabling real-time, high-precision navigation with minimal resource consumption.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale commercial search systems optimize for relevance to drive successful sessions that help users find what they are looking for. To maximize relevance, we leverage two complementary objectives: behavioral relevance (results users tend to click or download) and textual relevance (a result's semantic fit to the query). A persistent challenge is the scarcity of expert-provided textual relevance labels relative to abundant behavioral relevance labels. We first address this by systematically evaluating LLM configurations, finding that a specialized, fine-tuned model significantly outperforms a much larger pre-trained one in providing highly relevant labels. Using this optimal model as a force multiplier, we generate millions of textual relevance labels to overcome the data scarcity. We show that augmenting our production ranker with these textual relevance labels leads to a significant outward shift of the Pareto frontier: offline NDCG improves for behavioral relevance while simultaneously increasing for textual relevance. These offline gains were validated by a worldwide A/B test on the App Store ranker, which demonstrated a statistically significant +0.24% increase in conversion rate, with the most substantial performance gains occurring in tail queries, where the new textual relevance labels provide a robust signal in the absence of reliable behavioral relevance labels.",

    "abstract": "Indicator-based approaches to machine consciousness recommend mechanism-linked evidence triangulated across tasks, supported by architectural inspection and causal intervention. Inspired by Humphrey's ipsundrum hypothesis, we implement ReCoN-Ipsundrum, an inspectable agent that extends a ReCoN state machine with a recurrent persistence loop over sensory salience Ns and an optional affect proxy reporting valence/arousal. Across fixed-parameter ablations (ReCoN, Ipsundrum, Ipsundrum+affect), we operationalize Humphrey's qualiaphilia (preference for sensory experience for its own sake) as a familiarity-controlled scenic-over-dull route choice. We find a novelty dissociation: non-affect variants are novelty-sensitive (Delta scenic-entry = 0.07). Affect coupling is stable (Delta scenic-entry = 0.01) even when scenic is less novel (median Delta novelty ~ -0.43). In reward-free exploratory play, the affect variant shows structured local investigation (scan events 31.4 vs. 0.9; cycle score 7.6). In a pain-tail probe, only the affect variant sustains prolonged planned caution (tail duration 90 vs. 5). Lesioning feedback+integration selectively reduces post-stimulus persistence in ipsundrum variants (AUC drop 27.62, 27.9%) while leaving ReCoN unchanged. These dissociations link recurrence -> persistence and affect-coupled control -> preference stability, scanning, and lingering caution, illustrating how indicator-like signatures can be engineered and why mechanistic and causal evidence should accompany behavioral markers.",

While there is a lot of active research on improving the machine learning algorithms for skeleton-based action recognition, not much attention has been given to the quality of the input skeleton data itself. This work demonstrates that by making use of multiple camera views to triangulate more accurate 3D~skeletons, the performance of state-of-the-art action recognition models can be improved significantly. This suggests that the quality of the input data is currently a limiting factor for the performance of these models. Based on these results, it is argued that the cost-benefit ratio of using multiple cameras is very favorable in most practical use-cases, therefore future research in skeleton-based action recognition should consider multi-view applications as the standard setup.",

Previous studies suggest that the answer lies in CLIP-like contrastive Vision-Language Models (VLMs), due to their remarkable performance in zero-shot classification. In contrast, Large Multimodal Models (LMM) are more suitable for complex tasks. In this work, we argue that this answer overlooks an important capability of LMMs: in-context learning. We benchmark state-of-the-art LMMs on diverse datasets for closed-world classification and find that, although their zero-shot performance is lower than CLIP's, LMMs with a few in-context examples can match or even surpass contrastive VLMs with cache-based adapters, their \"in-context\" equivalent. We extend this analysis to the open-world setting, where the generative nature of LMMs makes them more suitable for the task. In this challenging scenario, LMMs struggle whenever provided with imperfect context information. To address this issue, we propose CIRCLE, a simple training-free method that assigns pseudo-labels to in-context examples, iteratively refining them with the available context itself. Through extensive experiments, we show that CIRCLE establishes a robust baseline for open-world classification, surpassing VLM counterparts and highlighting the potential of LMMs to serve as unified classifiers, and a flexible alternative to specialized models.",

    "abstract": "With the explosive growth of digital entertainment, automated video summarization has become indispensable for applications such as content indexing, personalized recommendation, and efficient media archiving. Automatic synopsis generation for long-form videos, such as movies and TV series, presents a significant challenge for existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs). While proficient at single-image captioning, these general-purpose models often exhibit critical failures in long-duration contexts, primarily a lack of ID-consistent character identification and a fractured narrative coherence. To overcome these limitations, we propose MovieTeller, a novel framework for generating movie synopses via tool-augmented progressive abstraction. Our core contribution is a training-free, tool-augmented, fact-grounded generation process. Instead of requiring costly model fine-tuning, our framework directly leverages off-the-shelf models in a plug-and-play manner. We first invoke a specialized face recognition model as an external \"tool\" to establish Factual Groundings--precise character identities and their corresponding bounding boxes. These groundings are then injected into the prompt to steer the VLM's reasoning, ensuring the generated scene descriptions are anchored to verifiable facts. Furthermore, our progressive abstraction pipeline decomposes the summarization of a full-length movie into a multi-stage process, effectively mitigating the context length limitations of current VLMs. Experiments demonstrate that our approach yields significant improvements in factual accuracy, character consistency, and overall narrative coherence compared to end-to-end baselines.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) are often advertised as enabling parallel token generation, yet practical fast DLMs frequently converge to left-to-right, autoregressive (AR)-like decoding dynamics. In contrast, genuinely non-AR generation is promising because it removes AR's sequential bottleneck, better exploiting parallel hardware to reduce synchronization/communication overhead and improve latency scaling with output length. We argue that a primary driver of AR-like decoding is a mismatch between DLM objectives and the highly sequential structure of widely used training data, including standard pretraining corpora and long chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision. Motivated by this diagnosis, we propose NAP (Non-Autoregressive Parallel DLMs), a proof-of-concept, data-centric approach that better aligns supervision with non-AR parallel decoding. NAP curates examples as multiple independent reasoning trajectories and couples them with a parallel-forced decoding strategy that encourages multi-token parallel updates. Across math reasoning benchmarks, NAP yields stronger performance under parallel decoding than DLMs trained on standard long CoT data, with gains growing as parallelism increases. Our results suggest that revisiting data and supervision is a principled direction for mitigating AR-like behavior and moving toward genuinely non-autoregressive parallel generation in DLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/pixeli99/NAP.",

    "abstract": "We present UniScale, a unified, scale-aware multi-view 3D reconstruction framework for robotic applications that flexibly integrates geometric priors through a modular, semantically informed design. In vision-based robotic navigation, the accurate extraction of environmental structure from raw image sequences is critical for downstream tasks. UniScale addresses this challenge with a single feed-forward network that jointly estimates camera intrinsics and extrinsics, scale-invariant depth and point maps, and the metric scale of a scene from multi-view images, while optionally incorporating auxiliary geometric priors when available. By combining global contextual reasoning with camera-aware feature representations, UniScale is able to recover the metric-scale of the scene. In robotic settings where camera intrinsics are known, they can be easily incorporated to improve performance, with additional gains obtained when camera poses are also available. This co-design enables robust, metric-aware 3D reconstruction within a single unified model. Importantly, UniScale does not require training from scratch, and leverages world priors exhibited in pre-existing models without geometric encoding strategies, making it particularly suitable for resource-constrained robotic teams. We evaluate UniScale on multiple benchmarks, demonstrating strong generalization and consistent performance across diverse environments. We will release our implementation upon acceptance.",

    "abstract": "I/O performance is crucial to efficiency in data-intensive scientific computing; but tuning large-scale storage systems is complex, costly, and notoriously manpower-intensive, making it inaccessible for most domain scientists. To address this problem, we propose STELLAR, an autonomous tuner for high-performance parallel file systems. Our evaluations show that STELLAR almost always selects near-optimal parameter configurations for parallel file systems within the first five attempts, even for previously unseen applications.   STELLAR differs fundamentally from traditional autotuning methods, which often require hundreds of thousands of iterations to converge. Powered by large language models (LLMs), STELLAR enables autonomous end-to-end agentic tuning by (1) accurately extracting tunable parameters from software manuals, (2) analyzing I/O trace logs generated by applications, (3) selecting initial tuning strategies, (4) rerunning applications on real systems and collecting I/O performance feedback, (5) adjusting tuning strategies and repeating the tuning cycle, and (6) reflecting on and summarizing tuning experiences into reusable knowledge for future optimizations. STELLAR integrates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), tool execution, LLM-based reasoning, and a multiagent design to stabilize reasoning and combat hallucinations.   We evaluate the impact of each component on optimization outcomes, providing design insights for similar systems in other optimization domains. STELLAR's architecture and empirical results highlight a promising approach to complex system optimization, especially for problems with large search spaces and high exploration costs, while making I/O tuning more accessible to domain scientists with minimal added resources.",

However, establishing a reliable generalization measure for statistically singular models such as deep neural networks (DNNs) is difficult due to their complex nature. This study focuses on Takeuchi's information criterion (TIC) to investigate the conditions under which this classical measure can effectively explain the generalization gaps of DNNs. Importantly, the developed theory indicates the applicability of TIC near the neural tangent kernel (NTK) regime. In a series of experiments, we trained more than 5,000 DNN models with 12 architectures, including large models (e.g., VGG-16), on four datasets, and estimated the corresponding TIC values to examine the relationship between the generalization gap and the TIC estimates. We applied several TIC approximation methods with feasible computational costs and assessed the accuracy trade-off. Our experimental results indicate that the estimated TIC values correlate well with the generalization gap under conditions close to the NTK regime. However, we show both theoretically and empirically that outside the NTK regime such correlation disappears. Finally, we demonstrate that TIC provides better trial pruning ability than existing methods for hyperparameter optimization.",

We argue that current computer vision task formulations are inherently constrained by matrix-based thinking: standard architectures rely on matrix-valued weights and vectorvalued biases, requiring structural flattening that restricts the space of naturally expressible tasks. GE-MLPs lift this constraint by operating with tensor-valued parameters, enabling explicit control over which dimensions are preserved or contracted without information loss. Through rigorous mathematical derivations, we demonstrate that classification, segmentation, and detection are special cases of MTL, differing only in their dimensional configuration within a formally defined task space. We further prove that this task space is strictly larger than what matrix-based formulations can natively express, enabling principled task configurations such as spatiotemporal or cross modal predictions that require destructive flattening under conventional approaches. This work provides a mathematical foundation for understanding, comparing, and designing computer vision tasks through the lens of tensor algebra.",

The problem is fundamental in inter-procedural analysis where properties of functions are first obtained via the generation of function contracts and then the generated contracts are used as building blocks to analyze the whole program. Typical objectives in function contract generation include pre-/post-conditions and assigns information (that specifies the modification information over program variables and memory segments during function execution). In programs with array manipulations, a crucial point in function contract generation is the treatment of array segments that imposes challenges in inferring invariants and assigns information over such segments. To address this challenge, we propose a novel symbolic execution framework that carries invariants and assigns information over contiguous segments of arrays. We implement our framework as a prototype within LLVM, and further integrate our prototype with the ACSL assertion format and the Frama-C software verification platform. Experimental evaluation over a variety of benchmarks from the literature and functions from realistic libraries shows that our framework is capable of handling array manipulating functions that indeed involve the carry of array information and are beyond existing approaches.",

    "abstract": "Plug-and-Play diffusion prior (PnPDP) frameworks have emerged as a powerful paradigm for solving imaging inverse problems by treating pretrained generative models as modular priors. However, we identify a critical flaw in prevailing PnP solvers (e.g., based on HQS or Proximal Gradient): they function as memoryless operators, updating estimates solely based on instantaneous gradients. This lack of historical tracking inevitably leads to non-vanishing steady-state bias, where the reconstruction fails to strictly satisfy physical measurements under heavy corruption. To resolve this, we propose Dual-Coupled PnP Diffusion, which restores the classical dual variable to provide integral feedback, theoretically guaranteeing asymptotic convergence to the exact data manifold. However, this rigorous geometric coupling introduces a secondary challenge: the accumulated dual residuals exhibit spectrally colored, structured artifacts that violate the Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) assumption of diffusion priors, causing severe hallucinations. To bridge this gap, we introduce Spectral Homogenization (SH), a frequency-domain adaptation mechanism that modulates these structured residuals into statistically compliant pseudo-AWGN inputs. This effectively aligns the solver's rigorous optimization trajectory with the denoiser's valid statistical manifold. Extensive experiments on CT and MRI reconstruction demonstrate that our approach resolves the bias-hallucination trade-off, achieving state-of-the-art fidelity with significantly accelerated convergence.",

The analysis of roles and positions is highly developed for social systems that involve only pairwise interactions among actors - however, in contemporary social network analysis it is increasingly common to use models that can take into account higher-order interactions as well. In this paper we take a category-theoretic approach to the question of how to lift role and positional analysis from graphs to hypergraphs, which can accommodate higher-order interactions. We use the framework of universal coalgebra - a 'theory of systems' with origins in computer science and logic - to formalize the main concepts of role and positional analysis and extend them to a large class of structures that includes both graphs and hypergraphs. As evidence for the validity of our definitions, we prove a very general functoriality theorem that specializes, in the case of graphs, to a folkloric observation about the compatibility of positional and role analysis.",

    "abstract": "Tactile sensing allows robots to gather detailed geometric information about objects through physical interaction, complementing vision-based approaches. However, efficiently acquiring useful tactile data remains challenging due to the time-consuming nature of physical contact and the need to strategically choose contact locations that maximize information gain while minimizing physical interactions. This paper studies how different contact modes affect object shape reconstruction using a tactile-enabled dexterous gripper. We compare three contact interaction modes: grasp-releasing, sliding induced by finger-grazing, and palm-rolling. These contact modes are combined with an information-theoretic exploration framework that guides subsequent sampling locations using a shape completion model. Our results show that the improved tactile sensing efficiency of finger-grazing and palm-rolling translates into faster convergence in shape reconstruction, requiring 34% fewer physical interactions while improving reconstruction accuracy by 55%. We validate our approach using a UR5e robot arm equipped with an Inspire-Robots Dexterous Hand, showing robust performance across primitive object geometries.",

    "abstract": "Human behaviors in the real world naturally encode rich, long-term contextual information that can be leveraged to train embodied agents for perception, understanding, and acting. However, existing capture systems typically rely on costly studio setups and wearable devices, limiting the large-scale collection of scene-conditioned human motion data in the wild. To address this, we propose EmbodMocap, a portable and affordable data collection pipeline using two moving iPhones. Our key idea is to jointly calibrate dual RGB-D sequences to reconstruct both humans and scenes within a unified metric world coordinate frame. The proposed method allows metric-scale and scene-consistent capture in everyday environments without static cameras or markers, bridging human motion and scene geometry seamlessly. Compared with optical capture ground truth, we demonstrate that the dual-view setting exhibits a remarkable ability to mitigate depth ambiguity, achieving superior alignment and reconstruction performance over single iphone or monocular models. Based on the collected data, we empower three embodied AI tasks: monocular human-scene-reconstruction, where we fine-tune on feedforward models that output metric-scale, world-space aligned humans and scenes; physics-based character animation, where we prove our data could be used to scale human-object interaction skills and scene-aware motion tracking; and robot motion control, where we train a humanoid robot via sim-to-real RL to replicate human motions depicted in videos. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our pipeline and its contributions towards advancing embodied AI research.",

    "abstract": "Colonoscopy video generation delivers dynamic, information-rich data critical for diagnosing intestinal diseases, particularly in data-scarce scenarios. High-quality video generation demands temporal consistency and precise control over clinical attributes, but faces challenges from irregular intestinal structures, diverse disease representations, and various imaging modalities. To this end, we propose ColoDiff, a diffusion-based framework that generates dynamic-consistent and content-aware colonoscopy videos, aiming to alleviate data shortage and assist clinical analysis. At the inter-frame level, our TimeStream module decouples temporal dependency from video sequences through a cross-frame tokenization mechanism, enabling intricate dynamic modeling despite irregular intestinal structures. At the intra-frame level, our Content-Aware module incorporates noise-injected embeddings and learnable prototypes to realize precise control over clinical attributes, breaking through the coarse guidance of diffusion models. Additionally, ColoDiff employs a non-Markovian sampling strategy that cuts steps by over 90% for real-time generation. ColoDiff is evaluated across three public datasets and one hospital database, based on both generation metrics and downstream tasks including disease diagnosis, modality discrimination, bowel preparation scoring, and lesion segmentation. Extensive experiments show ColoDiff generates videos with smooth transitions and rich dynamics. ColoDiff presents an effort in controllable colonoscopy video generation, revealing the potential of synthetic videos in complementing authentic representation and mitigating data scarcity in clinical settings.",

    "abstract": "Modern machine learning models are deployed in diverse, non-stationary environments where they must continually adapt to new tasks and evolving knowledge. Continual fine-tuning and in-context learning are costly and brittle, whereas neural memory methods promise lightweight updates with minimal forgetting. However, existing neural memory models typically assume a single fixed objective and homogeneous information streams, leaving users with no control over what the model remembers or ignores over time. To address this challenge, we propose a generalized neural memory system that performs flexible updates based on learning instructions specified in natural language. Our approach enables adaptive agents to learn selectively from heterogeneous information sources, supporting settings, such as healthcare and customer service, where fixed-objective memory updates are insufficient.",

    "abstract": "Reducing the hardware footprint of large language models (LLMs) during decoding is critical for efficient long-sequence generation. A key bottleneck is the key-value (KV) cache, whose size scales with sequence length and easily dominates the memory footprint of the model. Previous work proposed quantization methods that are focused on compressing the KV cache while maintaining its information. We introduce InnerQ, a hardware-aware KV-cache quantization scheme that lowers decode latency without sacrificing accuracy. InnerQ applies group-wise quantization while grouping the cache matrices over their inner dimension. Unlike previous work that group over the outer dimension, InnerQ aligns dequantization with the vector-matrix multiplication and enables scale factor reuse across GPU compute units. This reduces memory accesses and accelerates dequantization, yielding up to $22\\%$ speedup over previous work and up to $88\\%$ over half-precision vector-matrix multiplication. To preserve fidelity under aggressive compression, InnerQ incorporates (i) hybrid quantization, selecting symmetric or asymmetric quantization per group based on local statistics; (ii) high-precision windows for both the most recent tokens and the attention sink tokens to mitigate outlier leakage; and (iii) per-channel normalization of the key cache, computed once during prefill and folded into the query to avoid runtime overhead. Our evaluation experiments on Llama models shows that InnerQ maintains a few-shot GSM8K performance comparable to non-quantized KV caches and surpasses prior KV cache quantization methods.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in scientific research, offering new capabilities for knowledge discovery and reasoning. In single-cell biology, however, evaluation practices for both general and specialized LLMs remain inadequate: existing benchmarks are fragmented across tasks, adopt formats such as multiple-choice classification that diverge from real-world usage, and rely on metrics lacking interpretability and biological grounding. We present SC-ARENA, a natural language evaluation framework tailored to single-cell foundation models. SC-ARENA formalizes a virtual cell abstraction that unifies evaluation targets by representing both intrinsic attributes and gene-level interactions. Within this paradigm, we define five natural language tasks (cell type annotation, captioning, generation, perturbation prediction, and scientific QA) that probe core reasoning capabilities in cellular biology. To overcome the limitations of brittle string-matching metrics, we introduce knowledge-augmented evaluation, which incorporates external ontologies, marker databases, and scientific literature to support biologically faithful and interpretable judgments. Experiments and analysis across both general-purpose and domain-specialized LLMs demonstrate that (i) under the Virtual Cell unified evaluation paradigm, current models achieve uneven performance on biologically complex tasks, particularly those demanding mechanistic or causal understanding; and (ii) our knowledge-augmented evaluation framework ensures biological correctness, provides interpretable, evidence-grounded rationales, and achieves high discriminative capacity, overcoming the brittleness and opacity of conventional metrics. SC-Arena thus provides a unified and interpretable framework for assessing LLMs in single-cell biology, pointing toward the development of biology-aligned, generalizable foundation models.",

    "abstract": "Transformer-based large language models exhibit in-context learning, enabling adaptation to downstream tasks via few-shot prompting with demonstrations. In practice, such models are often fine-tuned to improve zero-shot performance on downstream tasks, allowing them to solve tasks without examples and thereby reducing inference costs. However, fine-tuning can degrade in-context learning, limiting the performance of fine-tuned models on tasks not seen during fine-tuning. Using linear attention models, we provide a theoretical analysis that characterizes how fine-tuning objectives modify attention parameters and identifies conditions under which this leads to degraded few-shot performance. We show that fine-tuning all attention parameters can harm in-context learning, whereas restricting updates to the value matrix improves zero-shot performance while preserving in-context learning. We further show that incorporating an auxiliary few-shot loss enhances in-context learning primarily on the target task, at the expense of degraded in-context learning ability on tasks not seen during fine-tuning. We empirically validate our theoretical results.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have evolved from reactive assistants to systems capable of planning, executing actions via tools, and iterating over environment observations. However, they remain vulnerable to structural limitations: lack of native state, context degradation over long horizons, and the gap between probabilistic generation and deterministic execution requirements. This paper presents the ESAA (Event Sourcing for Autonomous Agents) architecture, which separates the agent's cognitive intention from the project's state mutation, inspired by the Event Sourcing pattern. In ESAA, agents emit only structured intentions in validated JSON (agent.result or issue.report); a deterministic orchestrator validates, persists events in an append-only log (activity.jsonl), applies file-writing effects, and projects a verifiable materialized view (roadmap.json). The proposal incorporates boundary contracts (AGENT_CONTRACT.yaml), metaprompting profiles (PARCER), and replay verification with hashing (esaa verify), ensuring the immutability of completed tasks and forensic traceability. Two case studies validate the architecture: (i) a landing page project (9 tasks, 49 events, single-agent composition) and (ii) a clinical dashboard system (50 tasks, 86 events, 4 concurrent agents across 8 phases), both concluding with run.status=success and verify_status=ok. The multi-agent case study demonstrates real concurrent orchestration with heterogeneous LLMs (Claude Sonnet 4.6, Codex GPT-5, Antigravity/Gemini 3 Pro, and Claude Opus 4.6), providing empirical evidence of the architecture's scalability beyond single-agent scenarios.",

In this work, we study fairness-aware mixed-precision quantization schemes for medical image classification under explicit bit budgets. We introduce FairQuant, a framework that combines group-aware importance analysis, budgeted mixed-precision allocation, and a learnable Bit-Aware Quantization (BAQ) mode that jointly optimizes weights and per-unit bit allocations under bitrate and fairness regularization. We evaluate the method on Fitzpatrick17k and ISIC2019 across ResNet18/50, DeiT-Tiny, and TinyViT. Results show that FairQuant configurations with average precision near 4-6 bits recover much of the Uniform 8-bit accuracy while improving worst-group performance relative to Uniform 4- and 8-bit baselines, with comparable fairness metrics under shared budgets.",

To tackle imprecise color transfer, we introduce visual reference enhancement via instance patch embedding, enabling precise alignment and fusion of reference color information. To resolve insufficient physical detail preservation, we design physical detail reinforcement using physical features that effectively capture and retain high-frequency textures. To mitigate motion-induced temporal inconsistency, we propose sketch-based dynamic RoPE encoding that adaptively models motion-aware spatial-temporal dependencies. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Uni-Animator achieves competitive performance on both image and video sketch colorization, matching that of task-specific methods while unlocking unified cross-domain capabilities with high detail fidelity and robust temporal consistency.",

    "abstract": "We propose an efficient retraining strategy for a parameterized Reduced Order Model (ROM) that attains accuracy comparable to full retraining while requiring only a fraction of the computational time and relying solely on sparse observations of the full system. The architecture employs an encode-process-decode structure: a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to perform dimensionality reduction, and a transformer network to evolve the latent states and model the dynamics. The ROM is parameterized by an external control variable, the Reynolds number in the Navier-Stokes setting, with the transformer exploiting attention mechanisms to capture both temporal dependencies and parameter effects. The probabilistic VAE enables stochastic sampling of trajectory ensembles, providing predictive means and uncertainty quantification through the first two moments. After initial training on a limited set of dynamical regimes, the model is adapted to out-of-sample parameter regions using only sparse data. Its probabilistic formulation naturally supports ensemble generation, which we employ within an ensemble Kalman filtering framework to assimilate data and reconstruct full-state trajectories from minimal observations. We further show that, for the dynamical system considered, the dominant source of error in out-of-sample forecasts stems from distortions of the latent manifold rather than changes in the latent dynamics. Consequently, retraining can be limited to the autoencoder, allowing for a lightweight, computationally efficient, real-time adaptation procedure with very sparse fine-tuning data.",

Our result suggests that no efficient classical algorithm can solve a broad class of stoquastic ground-state problems.   Our graph is constructed from a class of high-degree, high-girth spectral expanders to which self-similar trees are attached. This builds on and extends prior work of Gilyén, Hastings, and Vazirani [Quantum 2021, STOC 2021], which ruled out dequantization for a specific stoquastic adiabatic path algorithm.

We hypothesize that a significant advantage of tree-based methods lies in their intrinsic capability to model and exploit non-linear interactions induced by features with categorical characteristics. In contrast, neural-based methods exhibit biases toward uniform numerical processing of features and smooth solutions, making it challenging for them to effectively leverage such patterns. We address this performance gap by using statistical-based feature processing techniques to identify features that are strongly correlated with the target once discretized. We further mitigate the bias of deep models for overly-smooth solutions, a bias that does not align with the inherent properties of the data, using Learned Fourier. We show that our proposed feature preprocessing significantly boosts the performance of deep learning models and enables them to achieve a performance that closely matches or surpasses XGBoost on a comprehensive tabular data benchmark.",

    "abstract": "Protein sequences are abundant in repeating segments, both as exact copies and as approximate segments with mutations. These repeats are important for protein structure and function, motivating decades of algorithmic work on repeat identification. Recent work has shown that protein language models (PLMs) identify repeats, by examining their behavior in masked-token prediction. To elucidate their internal mechanisms, we investigate how PLMs detect both exact and approximate repeats. We find that the mechanism for approximate repeats functionally subsumes that of exact repeats. We then characterize this mechanism, revealing two main stages: PLMs first build feature representations using both general positional attention heads and biologically specialized components, such as neurons that encode amino-acid similarity. Then, induction heads attend to aligned tokens across repeated segments, promoting the correct answer. Our results reveal how PLMs solve this biological task by combining language-based pattern matching with specialized biological knowledge, thereby establishing a basis for studying more complex evolutionary processes in PLMs.",

    "abstract": "Accurate, real-time crowd counting on railway platforms is essential for safety and capacity management. We propose to use a single camera mounted in a train, scanning the platform while arriving. While hardware constraints are simple, counting remains challenging due to dense occlusions, camera motion, and perspective distortions during train arrivals. Most existing tracking-by-detection approaches assume static cameras or ignore physical consistency in motion modeling, leading to unreliable counting under dynamic conditions. We propose a physics-constrained tracking framework that unifies detection, appearance, and 3D motion reasoning in a real-time pipeline. Our approach integrates a transfer-learned YOLOv11m detector with EfficientNet-B0 appearance encoding within DeepSORT, while introducing a physics-constrained Kalman model (Phys-3D) that enforces physically plausible 3D motion dynamics through pinhole geometry. To address counting brittleness under occlusions, we implement a virtual counting band with persistence. On our platform benchmark, MOT-RailwayPlatformCrowdHead Dataset(MOT-RPCH), our method reduces counting error to 2.97%, demonstrating robust performance despite motion and occlusions. Our results show that incorporating first-principles geometry and motion priors enables reliable crowd counting in safety-critical transportation scenarios, facilitating effective train scheduling and platform safety management.",

This paper addresses MFGs formulated in continuous time with discrete state spaces, where agents' dynamics are governed by continuous-time Markov chains -- relevant to applications like population dynamics and queueing networks. While prior research has largely focused on theoretical aspects of continuous-time discrete-state MFGs, efficient computational methods for determining equilibria remain underdeveloped. Inspired by discrete-time approaches, we approximate the classical Nash equilibria by regularization methods, enabling more computationally tractable solution algorithms.

We validate the effectiveness and practicality of our approach via illustrative numerical examples.",

In this work, we present Latent Gaussian Splatting for 4D Panoptic Occupancy Tracking (LaGS) that advances spatiotemporal scene understanding in a holistic direction. Our approach incorporates camera-based end-to-end tracking with mask-based multi-view panoptic occupancy prediction, and addresses the key challenge of efficiently aggregating multi-view information into 3D voxel grids via a novel latent Gaussian splatting approach. Specifically, we first fuse observations into 3D Gaussians that serve as a sparse point-centric latent representation of the 3D scene, and then splat the aggregated features onto a 3D voxel grid that is decoded by a mask-based segmentation head. We evaluate LaGS on the Occ3D nuScenes and Waymo datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance for 4D panoptic occupancy tracking. We make our code available at https://lags.cs.uni-freiburg.de/.",

    "title": "Learning Continuous Wasserstein Barycenter Space for Generalized All-in-One Image Restoration",
    "abstract": "Despite substantial advances in all-in-one image restoration for addressing diverse degradations within a unified model, existing methods remain vulnerable to out-of-distribution degradations, thereby limiting their generalization in real-world scenarios. To tackle the challenge, this work is motivated by the intuition that multisource degraded feature distributions are induced by different degradation-specific shifts from an underlying degradation-agnostic distribution, and recovering such a shared distribution is thus crucial for achieving generalization across degradations. With this insight, we propose BaryIR, a representation learning framework that aligns multisource degraded features in the Wasserstein barycenter (WB) space, which models a degradation-agnostic distribution by minimizing the average of Wasserstein distances to multisource degraded distributions. We further introduce residual subspaces, whose embeddings are mutually contrasted while remaining orthogonal to the WB embeddings. Consequently, BaryIR explicitly decouples two orthogonal spaces: a WB space that encodes the degradation-agnostic invariant contents shared across degradations, and residual subspaces that adaptively preserve the degradation-specific knowledge. This disentanglement mitigates overfitting to in-distribution degradations and enables adaptive restoration grounded on the degradation-agnostic shared invariance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BaryIR performs competitively against state-of-the-art all-in-one methods. Notably, BaryIR generalizes well to unseen degradations (\\textit{e.g.,} types and levels) and shows remarkable robustness in learning generalized features, even when trained on limited degradation types and evaluated on real-world data with mixed degradations.",

One of the main objectives of DPs is to enhance democratic participation, by allowing citizens to post, comment, and vote on policy proposals. But in what order should these proposals be listed? This paper makes a start with the principled evaluation of sorting methods on DPs. First, we introduce a conceptual framework that allows us to classify and compare sorting methods in terms of their purpose and the parameters they take into account. Second, we observe that the choice for a sorting method is often ad hoc and rarely justified. Third and last, we criticise sorting by number of approvals ('likes'), a method that is very common in practice. On the one hand, we show that if approvals are used for sorting, this should be done in an integrated way, also taking into account other parameters. On the other hand, we argue that even if proposals are on a par in terms of those other parameters, there are other, more appropriate ways to sort proposals in light of the approvals they have received.",

Existing solutions either compromise decentralization or suffer from scalability bottlenecks due to linear on-chain costs. To address this, we present SettleFL, a trustless and scalable reward settlement protocol designed to minimize total economic friction by offering a family of two interoperable protocols. Leveraging a shared domain-specific circuit architecture, SettleFL offers two interoperable strategies: (1) a Commit-and-Challenge variant that minimizes on-chain costs via optimistic execution and dispute-driven arbitration, and (2) a Commit-with-Proof variant that guarantees instant finality through per-round validity proofs. This design allows the protocol to flexibly adapt to varying latency and cost constraints while enforcing rational robustness without trusted coordination. We conduct extensive experiments combining real FL workloads and controlled simulations. Results show that SettleFL remains practical when scaling to 800 participants, achieving substantially lower gas cost.",

    "abstract": "Real-world multimodal agents solve multi-step workflows grounded in visual evidence. For example, an agent can troubleshoot a device by linking a wiring photo to a schematic and validating the fix with online documentation, or plan a trip by interpreting a transit map and checking schedules under routing constraints. However, existing multimodal benchmarks mainly evaluate single-turn visual reasoning or specific tool skills, and they do not fully capture the realism, visual subtlety, and long-horizon tool use that practical agents require. We introduce AgentVista, a benchmark for generalist multimodal agents that spans 25 sub-domains across 7 categories, pairing realistic and detail-rich visual scenarios with natural hybrid tool use. Tasks require long-horizon tool interactions across modalities, including web search, image search, page navigation, and code-based operations for both image processing and general programming. Comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models exposes significant gaps in their ability to carry out long-horizon multimodal tool use. Even the best model in our evaluation, Gemini-3-Pro with tools, achieves only 27.3% overall accuracy, and hard instances can require more than 25 tool-calling turns. We expect AgentVista to accelerate the development of more capable and reliable multimodal agents for realistic and ultra-challenging problem solving.",

Trained on Seamless Interaction Dataset, DyaDiT takes dyadic audio with optional social-context tokens to produce context-appropriate motion. It fuses information from both speakers to capture interaction dynamics, uses a motion dictionary to encode motion priors, and can optionally utilize the conversational partner's gestures to produce more responsive motion. We evaluate DyaDiT on standard motion generation metrics and conduct quantitative user studies, demonstrating that it not only surpasses existing methods on objective metrics but is also strongly preferred by users, highlighting its robustness and socially favorable motion generation.

    "abstract": "Foundation models must handle multiple generative processes, yet mechanistic interpretability largely studies capabilities in isolation; it remains unclear how a single transformer organizes multiple, potentially conflicting \"world models\". Previous experiments on Othello playing neural-networks test world-model learning but focus on a single game with a single set of rules. We introduce MetaOthello, a controlled suite of Othello variants with shared syntax but different rules or tokenizations, and train small GPTs on mixed-variant data to study how multiple world models are organized in a shared representation space. We find that transformers trained on mixed-game data do not partition their capacity into isolated sub-models; instead, they converge on a mostly shared board-state representation that transfers causally across variants. Linear probes trained on one variant can intervene on another's internal state with effectiveness approaching that of matched probes. For isomorphic games with token remapping, representations are equivalent up to a single orthogonal rotation that generalizes across layers. When rules partially overlap, early layers maintain game-agnostic representations while a middle layer identifies game identity, and later layers specialize. MetaOthello offers a path toward understanding not just whether transformers learn world models, but how they organize many at once.",

    "abstract": "Large language models are beginning to show steganographic capabilities. Such capabilities could allow misaligned models to evade oversight mechanisms. Yet principled methods to detect and quantify such behaviours are lacking. Classical definitions of steganography, and detection methods based on them, require a known reference distribution of non-steganographic signals. For the case of steganographic reasoning in LLMs, knowing such a reference distribution is not feasible; this renders these approaches inapplicable. We propose an alternative, \\textbf{decision-theoretic view of steganography}. Our central insight is that steganography creates an asymmetry in usable information between agents who can and cannot decode the hidden content (present within a steganographic signal), and this otherwise latent asymmetry can be inferred from the agents' observable actions. To formalise this perspective, we introduce generalised $\\mathcal{V}$-information: a utilitarian framework for measuring the amount of usable information within some input. We use this to define the \\textbf{steganographic gap} -- a measure that quantifies steganography by comparing the downstream utility of the steganographic signal to agents that can and cannot decode the hidden content. We empirically validate our formalism, and show that it can be used to detect, quantify, and mitigate steganographic reasoning in LLMs.",

To address these limitations, we propose the Pattern-Aware Alignment and Balanced Reasoning model (PATRA), introducing a pattern-aware mechanism that extracts trend and seasonality patterns from time series to achieve deep alignment. Furthermore, we design a task-aware balanced reward to harmonize learning across tasks of varying difficulty, incentivizing the generation of coherent Chains of Thought.

While recent 2D LMMs have begun to eliminate such encoders for efficiency and scalability, extending this paradigm to 3D remains challenging due to the unordered and large-scale nature of point clouds. This leaves a critical unanswered question: How can we design an LMM that tokenizes unordered 3D data effectively and efficiently without a cumbersome encoder? We propose Fase3D, the first efficient encoder-free Fourier-based 3D scene LMM. Fase3D tackles the challenges of scalability and permutation invariance with a novel tokenizer that combines point cloud serialization and the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to approximate self-attention. This design enables an effective and computationally minimal architecture, built upon three key innovations: First, we represent large scenes compactly via structured superpoints. Second, our space-filling curve serialization followed by an FFT enables efficient global context modeling and graph-based token merging. Lastly, our Fourier-augmented LoRA adapters inject global frequency-aware interactions into the LLMs at a negligible cost. Fase3D achieves performance comparable to encoder-based 3D LMMs while being significantly more efficient in computation and parameters. Project website: https://tev-fbk.github.io/Fase3D.",

Recent advancements represented by video generation models like Sora have demonstrated the potential of data-driven scaling laws to approximate physical dynamics, while the emerging Unified Multimodal Model (UMM) offers a promising architectural paradigm for integrating perception, language, and reasoning. Despite these advances, the field still lacks a principled theoretical framework that defines the essential properties requisite for a General World Model. In this paper, we propose that a World Model must be grounded in the Trinity of Consistency: Modal Consistency as the semantic interface, Spatial Consistency as the geometric basis, and Temporal Consistency as the causal engine. Through this tripartite lens, we systematically review the evolution of multimodal learning, revealing a trajectory from loosely coupled specialized modules toward unified architectures that enable the synergistic emergence of internal world simulators. To complement this conceptual framework, we introduce CoW-Bench, a benchmark centered on multi-frame reasoning and generation scenarios. CoW-Bench evaluates both video generation models and UMMs under a unified evaluation protocol. Our work establishes a principled pathway toward general world models, clarifying both the limitations of current systems and the architectural requirements for future progress.",

    "title": "On Sample-Efficient Generalized Planning via Learned Transition Models",
    "abstract": "Generalized planning studies the construction of solution strategies that generalize across families of planning problems sharing a common domain model, formally defined by a transition function $γ: S \\times A \\rightarrow S$. Classical approaches achieve such generalization through symbolic abstractions and explicit reasoning over $γ$. In contrast, recent Transformer-based planners, such as PlanGPT and Plansformer, largely cast generalized planning as direct action-sequence prediction, bypassing explicit transition modeling. While effective on in-distribution instances, these approaches typically require large datasets and model sizes, and often suffer from state drift in long-horizon settings due to the absence of explicit world-state evolution. In this work, we formulate generalized planning as a transition-model learning problem, in which a neural model explicitly approximates the successor-state function $\\hatγ \\approx γ$ and generates plans by rolling out symbolic state trajectories. Instead of predicting actions directly, the model autoregressively predicts intermediate world states, thereby learning the domain dynamics as an implicit world model. To study size-invariant generalization and sample efficiency, we systematically evaluate multiple state representations and neural architectures, including relational graph encodings. Our results show that learning explicit transition models yields higher out-of-distribution satisficing-plan success than direct action-sequence prediction in multiple domains, while achieving these gains with significantly fewer training instances and smaller models. This is an extended version of a short paper accepted at ICAPS 2026 under the same title.",

    "abstract": "Near-surface atmospheric conditions can differ sharply over tens to hundreds of meters due to land cover and topography, yet this variability is absent from current weather analyses and forecasts. It is unclear whether such meter-scale variability reflects irreducibly chaotic dynamics or contains a component predictable from surface characteristics and large-scale atmospheric forcing. Here we show that a substantial, physically coherent component of meter-scale near-surface weather is statistically recoverable from existing observations. By conditioning coarse atmospheric state on sparse surface station measurements and high-resolution Earth observation data, we infer spatially continuous fields of near-surface wind, temperature, and humidity at 10 m resolution across the contiguous United States. Relative to ERA5, the inferred fields reduce wind error by 29% and temperature and dewpoint error by 6%, while explaining substantially more spatial variance at fixed time steps. They also exhibit physically interpretable structure, including urban heat islands, evapotranspiration-driven humidity contrasts, and wind speed differences across land cover types. Our findings expand the frontier of weather modeling by demonstrating a computationally feasible approach to continental-scale meter-resolution inference. More broadly, they illustrate how conditioning coarse dynamical models on static fine-scale features can reveal previously unresolved components of the Earth system.",

    "title": "Prediction of Diffusion Coefficients in Mixtures with Tensor Completion",
    "abstract": "Predicting diffusion coefficients in mixtures is crucial for many applications, as experimental data remain scarce, and machine learning (ML) offers promising alternatives to established semi-empirical models. Among ML models, matrix completion methods (MCMs) have proven effective in predicting thermophysical properties, including diffusion coefficients in binary mixtures. However, MCMs are restricted to single-temperature predictions, and their accuracy depends strongly on the availability of high-quality experimental data for each temperature of interest. In this work, we address this challenge by presenting a hybrid tensor completion method (TCM) for predicting temperature-dependent diffusion coefficients at infinite dilution in binary mixtures. The TCM employs a Tucker decomposition and is jointly trained on experimental data for diffusion coefficients at infinite dilution in binary systems at 298 K, 313 K, and 333 K. Predictions from the semi-empirical SEGWE model serve as prior knowledge within a Bayesian training framework. The TCM then extrapolates linearly to any temperature between 268 K and 378 K, achieving markedly improved prediction accuracy compared to established models across all studied temperatures. To further enhance predictive performance, the experimental database was expanded using active learning (AL) strategies for targeted acquisition of new diffusion data by pulsed-field gradient (PFG) NMR measurements. Diffusion coefficients at infinite dilution in 19 solute + solvent systems were measured at 298 K, 313 K, and 333 K. Incorporating these results yields a substantial improvement in the TCM's predictive accuracy. These findings highlight the potential of combining data-efficient ML methods with adaptive experimentation to advance predictive modeling of transport properties.",

This design addresses three longstanding challenges in end-to-end learning: limited data, poor controllability, and inefficiency on hardware with constrained resources. Existing benchmarks focus mainly on handheld videos with a forward view in visible light, which restricts the applicability of stabilization to domains such as UAV nighttime remote sensing. To fill this gap, we introduce a new multimodal UAV aerial video dataset (UAV-Test).

    "abstract": "Multimodal LLMs can process speech and images, but they cannot hear a speaker's voice or see an object's texture. We show this is not a failure of encoding: speaker identity, emotion, and visual attributes survive through every LLM layer (3--55$\\times$ above chance in linear probes), yet removing 64--71% of modality-specific variance improves decoder loss. The decoder has no learned use for these directions; their presence is noise.   We formalize this as a mismatched decoder problem: a decoder trained on text can only extract information along text-aligned directions. Accessible information is bounded by the Generalized Mutual Information (GMI), with degradation scaling with distributional distance and decoder sensitivity. The bound is a property of the decoder's scoring rule, not of any particular architecture; it applies whether non-text inputs arrive through a learned projection, a discrete codebook, or no explicit adapter at all. We validate this across five models spanning speech and vision. A controlled experiment (two Prismatic VLMs differing only in encoder text-alignment) confirms the bottleneck is the decoder's scoring rule, not the encoder or projection. A LoRA intervention demonstrates the fix: training with an emotion objective improves emotion accessibility ($+$7.5%) without affecting other attributes, confirming that the training objective determines what becomes accessible.",

    "abstract": "Real-world dynamic graphs are often directed, with source and destination nodes exhibiting asymmetrical behavioral patterns and temporal dynamics. However, existing dynamic graph architectures largely rely on shared parameters for processing source and destination nodes, with limited or no systematic role-aware modeling. We propose DyGnROLE (Dynamic Graph Node-Role-Oriented Latent Encoding), a transformer-based architecture that explicitly disentangles source and destination representations. By using separate embedding vocabularies and role-semantic positional encodings, the model captures the distinct structural and temporal contexts unique to each role. Critical to the effectiveness of these specialized embeddings in low-label regimes is a self-supervised pretraining objective we introduce: Temporal Contrastive Link Prediction (TCLP). The pretraining uses the full unlabeled interaction history to encode informative structural biases, enabling the model to learn role-specific representations without requiring annotated data. Evaluation on future edge classification demonstrates that DyGnROLE substantially outperforms a diverse set of state-of-the-art baselines, establishing role-aware modeling as an effective strategy for dynamic graph learning.",

    "abstract": "With the increasing demand for robust person Re-ID in unconstrained environments, learning from datasets with noisy labels and sparse per-identity samples remains a critical challenge. Existing noise-robust person Re-ID methods primarily rely on loss-correction or sample-selection strategies using softmax outputs. However, these methods suffer from two key limitations: 1) Softmax exhibits translation invariance, leading to over-confident and unreliable predictions on corrupted labels. 2) Conventional sample selection based on small-loss criteria often discards valuable hard positives that are crucial for learning discriminative features. To overcome these issues, we propose the CAlibration-to-REfinement (CARE) method, a two-stage framework that seeks certainty through probabilistic evidence propagation from calibration to refinement. In the calibration stage, we propose the probabilistic evidence calibration (PEC) that dismantles softmax translation invariance by injecting adaptive learnable parameters into the similarity function, and employs an evidential calibration loss to mitigate overconfidence on mislabeled samples. In the refinement stage, we design the evidence propagation refinement (EPR) that can more accurately distinguish between clean and noisy samples. Specifically, the EPR contains two steps: Firstly, the composite angular margin (CAM) metric is proposed to precisely distinguish clean but hard-to-learn positive samples from mislabeled ones in a hyperspherical space; Secondly, the certainty-oriented sphere weighting (COSW) is developed to dynamically allocate the importance of samples according to CAM, ensuring clean instances drive model updates. Extensive experimental results on Market1501, DukeMTMC-ReID, and CUHK03 datasets under both random and patterned noises show that CARE achieves competitive performance.",

    "abstract": "Multi-behavior sequential recommendation (MBSR) aims to learn the dynamic and heterogeneous interactions of users' multi-behavior sequences, so as to capture user preferences under target behavior for the next interacted item prediction. Unlike previous methods that adopt unidirectional modeling by mapping auxiliary behaviors to target behavior, recent concerns are shifting from behavior-fixed to behavior-specific recommendation. However, these methods still ignore the user's latent preference that underlying decision-making, leading to suboptimal solutions. Meanwhile, due to the asymmetric deterministic between items and behaviors, discriminative paradigm based on preference scoring is unsuitable to capture the uncertainty from low-entropy behaviors to high-entropy items, failing to provide efficient and diverse recommendation. To address these challenges, we propose \\textbf{FatsMB}, a framework based diffusion model that guides preference generation \\textit{\\textbf{F}rom Behavior-\\textbf{A}gnostic \\textbf{T}o Behavior-\\textbf{S}pecific} in latent spaces, enabling diverse and accurate \\textit{\\textbf{M}ulti-\\textbf{B}ehavior Sequential Recommendation}.

    "abstract": "Let $\\mathrm{PG}(k-1,q)$ be the $(k-1)$-dimensional projective space over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$. An arc in $\\mathrm{PG}(k-1,q)$ is a set of points with the property that any $k$ of them span the entire space. The notion of pseudo-arc generalizes that of an arc by replacing points with higher-dimensional subspaces. Constructions of pseudo-arcs can be obtained from arcs defined over extension fields; such pseudo-arcs are necessarily Desarguesian, in the sense that all their elements belong to a Desarguesian spread. In contrast, genuinely non-Desarguesian pseudo-arcs are far less understood and have previously been known only in a few sporadic cases. In this paper, we introduce a new infinite family of non-Desarguesian pseudo-arcs consisting of $(h-1)$-dimensional subspaces of $\\mathrm{PG}(k-1,q)$ based on the imaginary spaces of a normal rational curve. We determine the size of the constructed pseudo-arcs explicitly and show that, by adding suitable osculating spaces of a normal rational curve defined over a subgeometry, we obtain pseudo-arcs of size $O(q^h)$. As $q$ grows, these sizes asymptotically attain the classical upper bound for pseudo-arcs established in 1971 by J.~A.~Thas, thereby showing that this bound is essentially sharp also in the non-Desarguesian setting. We further investigate the interaction between these new pseudo-arcs and quadrics. While Desarguesian pseudo-arcs from normal rational curve are complete intersections of quadrics, we prove that the new pseudo-arcs are not contained in any quadric of the ambient projective space. Finally, we translate our geometric results into coding theory. We show that the new pseudo-arcs correspond precisely to recent families of additive MDS codes introduced via a polynomial framework. As a consequence of their non-Desarguesian nature, we prove that these codes are not equivalent to linear MDS codes.",

We empirically demonstrate the tightness of the obtained certificates and showcase the versatility of the approach by training surrogate models leveraging three different frameworks: sample compression, model compression and PAC-Bayes theory.

The Emotion Analysis Agent quantifies stimulus intensity using a 6-emotion BERT classifier, and the Emotion Adjustment Agent rewrites texts into two presentation modes, BALANCED (neutralized text) and COOL (neutralized text + supplementary text), using an LLM. The Balance Monitoring Agent aggregates weekly information consumption patterns and generates personalized advice, while the Personal Guide Agent recommends a presentation mode according to consumer sensitivity. Experiments on 800 AG News articles demonstrated significant stimulus score reduction (up to 19.3%) and improved emotion balance while maintaining semantic preservation. Near-zero correlation between stimulus reduction and semantic preservation confirmed that the two are independently controllable. Category-level analysis revealed substantial reduction (17.8-33.8%) in Sports, Business, and Sci/Tech, whereas the effect was limited in the World category, where facts themselves are inherently high-stimulus. The proposed system provides a framework for supporting calm information reception of consumers without restricting access to the original text.",

Despite recent progress, many approaches still rely on multi-stage pipelines or full fine-tuning of large backbones, which increases training cost, while the broader WSOL community continues to face the challenge of partial object coverage. We present TriLite, a single-stage WSOL framework that leverages a frozen Vision Transformer with Dinov2 pre-training in a self-supervised manner, and introduces only a minimal number of trainable parameters (fewer than 800K on ImageNet-1K) for both classification and localization. At its core is the proposed TriHead module, which decomposes patch features into foreground, background, and ambiguous regions, thereby improving object coverage while suppressing spurious activations. By disentangling classification and localization objectives, TriLite effectively exploits the universal representations learned by self-supervised ViTs without requiring expensive end-to-end training. Extensive experiments on CUB-200-2011, ImageNet-1K, and OpenImages demonstrate that TriLite sets a new state of the art, while remaining significantly more parameter-efficient and easier to train than prior methods.

To rectify this gap, we have conducted an exhaustive review of hundreds of related works, organizing various transfer-based attacks into six distinct categories. Subsequently, we propose a comprehensive framework designed to serve as a benchmark for evaluating these attacks. In addition, we delineate common strategies that enhance adversarial transferability and highlight prevalent issues that could lead to unfair comparisons.

First, the method extracts correspondences between two frames and generates a great circle of directions compatible with each pair of correspondences. Then, by discretizing the unit sphere using a Fibonacci lattice as bin centers, each great circle casts votes for a range of directions, ensuring that features unaffected by noise or dynamic objects vote consistently for the correct motion direction. Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that the proposed method is on the Pareto frontier of accuracy versus efficiency. Additionally, experiments on SLAM show that the proposed method reduces RMSE by correcting the heading during camera pose initialization.",

    "title": "WARM-CAT: : Warm-Started Test-Time Comprehensive Knowledge Accumulation for Compositional Zero-Shot Learning",
    "abstract": "Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize novel attribute-object compositions based on the knowledge learned from seen ones. Existing methods suffer from performance degradation caused by the distribution shift of label space at test time, which stems from the inclusion of unseen compositions recombined from attributes and objects. To overcome the challenge, we propose a novel approach that accumulates comprehensive knowledge in both textual and visual modalities from unsupervised data to update multimodal prototypes at test time. Building on this, we further design an adaptive update weight to control the degree of prototype adjustment, enabling the model to flexibly adapt to distribution shift during testing. Moreover, a dynamic priority queue is introduced that stores high-confidence images to acquire visual prototypes from historical images for inference. Since the model tends to favor compositions already stored in the queue during testing, we warm-start the queue by initializing it with training images for visual prototypes of seen compositions and generating unseen visual prototypes using the mapping learned between seen and unseen textual prototypes. Considering the semantic consistency of multimodal knowledge, we align textual and visual prototypes by multimodal collaborative representation learning. To provide a more reliable evaluation for CZSL, we introduce a new benchmark dataset, C-Fashion, and refine the widely used but noisy MIT-States dataset. Extensive experiments indicate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark datasets under both closed-world and open-world settings.

    "abstract": "Neural operators have emerged as promising surrogate models for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), but struggle to generalise beyond training distributions and are often constrained to a fixed temporal discretisation. This work introduces a physics-informed training framework that addresses these limitations by decomposing PDEs using operator splitting methods, training separate neural operators to learn individual non-linear physical operators while approximating linear operators with fixed finite-difference convolutions. This modular mixture-of-experts architecture enables generalisation to novel physical regimes by explicitly encoding the underlying operator structure. We formulate the modelling task as a neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) where these learned operators constitute the right-hand side, enabling continuous-in-time predictions through standard ODE solvers and implicitly enforcing PDE constraints. Demonstrated on incompressible and compressible Navier-Stokes equations, our approach achieves better convergence and superior performance when generalising to unseen physics. The method remains parameter-efficient, enabling temporal extrapolation beyond training horizons, and provides interpretable components whose behaviour can be verified against known physics.",

    "abstract": "Activations have become the primary memory bottleneck in large-batch LLM training. However, existing compression methods fail to exploit the spectral structure of activations, resulting in slow convergence or limited compression. To address this, we bridge the relationship between the algorithm's fast convergence and the requirements for subspace projection, and show that an effective compression should yield an unbiased estimate of the original activation with low variance. We propose Principal-Random Subspace for LLM Activation Compression (PRAC), which novelly decomposes activations into two components: a principal subspace captured via SVD to retain dominant information, and a random subspace sampled from the orthogonal complement to approximate the tail. By introducing a precise scaling factor, we prove that PRAC yields an unbiased gradient estimator with minimum variance under certain conditions. Extensive experiments on pre-training and fine-tuning tasks demonstrate that PRAC achieves up to 36% total memory reduction with negligible performance degradation and minimal computational cost.",

    "abstract": "The sudden appearance of occluded pedestrians presents a critical safety challenge in autonomous driving. Conventional rule-based or purely data-driven approaches struggle with the inherent high uncertainty of these long-tail scenarios. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel framework grounded in Active Inference, which endows the agent with a human-like, belief-driven mechanism. Our framework leverages a Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filter (RBPF) to efficiently estimate the pedestrian's hybrid state. To emulate human-like cognitive processes under uncertainty, we introduce a Conditional Belief Reset mechanism and a Hypothesis Injection technique to explicitly model beliefs about the pedestrian's multiple latent intentions. Planning is achieved via a Cross-Entropy Method (CEM) enhanced Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) controller, which synergizes the efficient, iterative search of CEM with the inherent robustness of MPPI. Simulation experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces the collision rate compared to reactive, rule-based, and reinforcement learning (RL) baselines, while also exhibiting explainable and human-like driving behavior that reflects the agent's internal belief state.",

To meet the stringent latency requirements of online serving, structural lightweighting or knowledge distillation techniques are commonly employed for ranking model acceleration. However, these approaches typically lead to a non-negligible drop in accuracy. Notably, the angle of lossless acceleration by optimizing feature fusion matrix multiplication, particularly through structural reparameterization, remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose MaRI, a novel Matrix Re-parameterized Inference framework, which serves as a complementary approach to existing techniques while accelerating ranking model inference without any accuracy loss. MaRI is motivated by the observation that user-side computation is redundant in feature fusion matrix multiplication, and we therefore adopt the philosophy of structural reparameterization to alleviate such redundancy.",

Recent state space models (e.g., Vision Mamba) offer efficient long-range dependency modeling. However, their one-dimensional serialization weakens local spatial continuity and high-frequency representation. To this end, we propose SpectralMamba-UNet, a novel frequency-disentangled framework to decouple the learning of structural and textural information in the spectral domain. Our Spectral Decomposition and Modeling (SDM) module applies discrete cosine transform to decompose low- and high-frequency features, where low frequency contributes to global contextual modeling via a frequency-domain Mamba and high frequency preserves boundary-sensitive details. To balance spectral contributions, we introduce a Spectral Channel Reweighting (SCR) mechanism to form channel-wise frequency-aware attention, and a Spectral-Guided Fusion (SGF) module to achieve adaptively multi-scale fusion in the decoder. Experiments on five public benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements across diverse modalities and segmentation targets, validating the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach.",

    "abstract": "Event cameras record luminance changes with microsecond resolution, but converting their sparse, asynchronous output into dense tensors that neural networks can exploit remains a core challenge. Conventional histograms or globally-decayed time-surface representations apply fixed temporal parameters across the entire image plane, which in practice creates a trade-off between preserving spatial structure during still periods and retaining sharp edges during rapid motion. We introduce Locally Adaptive Decay Surfaces (LADS), a family of event representations in which the temporal decay at each location is modulated according to local signal dynamics. Three strategies are explored, based on event rate, Laplacian-of-Gaussian response, and high-frequency spectral energy. These adaptive schemes preserve detail in quiescent regions while reducing blur in regions of dense activity. Extensive experiments on the public data show that LADS consistently improves both face detection and facial landmark accuracy compared to standard non-adaptive representations. At 30 Hz, LADS achieves higher detection accuracy and lower landmark error than either baseline, and at 240 Hz it mitigates the accuracy decline typically observed at higher frequencies, sustaining 2.44 % normalized mean error for landmarks and 0.966 mAP50 in face detection. These high-frequency results even surpass the accuracy reported in prior works operating at 30 Hz, setting new benchmarks for event-based face analysis. Moreover, by preserving spatial structure at the representation stage, LADS supports the use of much lighter network architectures while still retaining real-time performance. These results highlight the importance of context-aware temporal integration for neuromorphic vision and point toward real-time, high-frequency human-computer interaction systems that exploit the unique advantages of event cameras.",

    "abstract": "The Bayesian update step poses significant computational challenges in high-dimensional nonlinear estimation. While log-homotopy particle flow filters offer an alternative to stochastic sampling, existing formulations usually yield stiff differential equations. Conversely, existing deep learning approximations typically treat the update as a black-box task or rely on asymptotic relaxation, neglecting the exact geometric structure of the finite-horizon probability transport. In this work, we propose a physics-informed neural particle flow, which is an amortized inference framework. To construct the flow, we couple the log-homotopy trajectory of the prior to posterior density function with the continuity equation describing the density evolution. This derivation yields a governing partial differential equation (PDE), referred to as the master PDE. By embedding this PDE as a physical constraint into the loss function, we train a neural network to approximate the transport velocity field. This approach enables purely unsupervised training, eliminating the need for ground-truth posterior samples. We demonstrate that the neural parameterization acts as an implicit regularizer, mitigating the numerical stiffness inherent to analytic flows and reducing online computational complexity. Experimental validation on multimodal benchmarks and a challenging nonlinear scenario confirms better mode coverage and robustness compared to state-of-the-art baselines.",

    "abstract": "Foundation models increasingly offer potential to support interactive, agentic workflows that assist researchers during analysis and interpretation of image data. Such workflows often require coupling vision to language to provide a natural-language interface. However, paired image-text data needed to learn this coupling are scarce and difficult to obtain in many research and clinical settings. One such setting is microscopic analysis of cell-body-stained histological human brain sections, which enables the study of cytoarchitecture: cell density and morphology and their laminar and areal organization. Here, we propose a label-mediated method that generates meaningful captions from images by linking images and text only through a label, without requiring curated paired image-text data. Given the label, we automatically mine area descriptions from related literature and use them as synthetic captions reflecting canonical cytoarchitectonic attributes. An existing cytoarchitectonic vision foundation model (CytoNet) is then coupled to a large language model via an image-to-text training objective, enabling microscopy regions to be described in natural language. Across 57 brain areas, the resulting method produces plausible area-level descriptions and supports open-set use through explicit rejection of unseen areas. It matches the cytoarchitectonic reference label for in-scope patches with 90.6% accuracy and, with the area label masked, its descriptions remain discriminative enough to recover the area in an 8-way test with 68.6% accuracy. These results suggest that weak, label-mediated pairing can suffice to connect existing biomedical vision foundation models to language, providing a practical recipe for integrating natural-language in domains where fine-grained paired annotations are scarce.",

    "title": "Q-Tag: Watermarking Quantum Circuit Generative Models",
    "abstract": "Quantum cloud platforms have become the most widely adopted and mainstream approach for accessing quantum computing resources, due to the scarcity and operational complexity of quantum hardware. In this service-oriented paradigm, quantum circuits, which constitute high-value intellectual property, are exposed to risks of unauthorized access, reuse, and misuse. Digital watermarking has been explored as a promising mechanism for protecting quantum circuits by embedding ownership information for tracing and verification. However, driven by recent advances in generative artificial intelligence, the paradigm of quantum circuit design is shifting from individually and manually constructed circuits to automated synthesis based on quantum circuit generative models (QCGMs). In such generative settings, protecting only individual output circuits is insufficient, and existing post hoc, circuit-centric watermarking methods are not designed to integrate with the generative process, often failing to simultaneously ensure stealthiness, functional correctness, and robustness at scale. These limitations highlight the need for a new watermarking paradigm that is natively integrated with quantum circuit generative models. In this work, we present the first watermarking framework for QCGMs, which embeds ownership signals into the generation process while preserving circuit fidelity. We introduce a symmetric sampling strategy that aligns watermark encoding with the model's Gaussian prior, and a synchronization mechanism that counteracts adversarial watermark attack through latent drift correction. Empirical results confirm that our method achieves high-fidelity circuit generation and robust watermark detection across a range of perturbations, paving the way for scalable, secure copyright protection in AI-powered quantum design.",

    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has enabled powerful authorship inference capabilities, raising growing concerns about unintended deanonymization risks in textual data such as news articles. In this work, we introduce an LLM agent designed to evaluate and mitigate such risks through a structured, interpretable pipeline. Central to our framework is the proposed $\\textit{SALA}$ (Stylometry-Assisted LLM Analysis) method, which integrates quantitative stylometric features with LLM reasoning for robust and transparent authorship attribution. Experiments on large-scale news datasets demonstrate that $\\textit{SALA}$, particularly when augmented with a database module, achieves high inference accuracy in various scenarios. Finally, we propose a guided recomposition strategy that leverages the agent's reasoning trace to generate rewriting prompts, effectively reducing authorship identifiability while preserving textual meaning. Our findings highlight both the deanonymization potential of LLM agents and the importance of interpretable, proactive defenses for safeguarding author privacy.",

    "abstract": "Risk-averse decision-making under uncertainty in partially observable domains is a central challenge in artificial intelligence and is essential for developing reliable autonomous agents. The formal framework for such problems is the partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), where risk sensitivity is introduced through a risk measure applied to the value function, with Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) being a particularly significant criterion. However, solving POMDPs is computationally intractable in general, and approximate methods rely on computationally expensive simulations of future agent trajectories. This work introduces a theoretical framework for accelerating CVaR value function evaluation in POMDPs with formal performance guarantees. We derive new bounds on the CVaR of a random variable X using an auxiliary random variable Y, under assumptions relating their cumulative distribution and density functions; these bounds yield interpretable concentration inequalities and converge as the distributional discrepancy vanishes. Building on this, we establish upper and lower bounds on the CVaR value function computable from a simplified belief-MDP, accommodating general simplifications of the transition dynamics. We develop estimators for these bounds within a particle-belief MDP framework with probabilistic guarantees, and employ them for acceleration via action elimination: actions whose bounds indicate suboptimality under the simplified model are safely discarded while ensuring consistency with the original POMDP. Empirical evaluation across multiple POMDP domains confirms that the bounds reliably separate safe from dangerous policies while achieving substantial computational speedups under the simplified model.",

    "abstract": "While second language (L2) learners may acquire target syntactic word order, mapping this syntax onto appropriate prosodic structures remains a persistent challenge. This study investigates the fossilization and stability of the L2 syntax-prosody interface by comparing 67 native Mandarin speakers with 67 Vietnamese learners using the BLCU-SAIT corpus. By integrating C-ToBI boundary annotation with Dependency Grammar analysis, we examined both the quantity of prosodic boundaries and their mapping to syntactic relations. Results reveal a non-linear acquisition: although high-proficiency learners (VNH) converge to the native baseline in boundary quantity at the Major Phrase level (B3), their structural mapping significantly diverges. Specifically, VNH demote the prosodic boundary at the Subject-Verb (SBV) interface (Major Phrase B3 -> Prosodic Word B1), while erroneously promoting the boundary at the Verb-Object (VOB) interface (Prosodic Word B1 -> Major Phrase B3). This strategy allows learners to maintain high long phrasal output at the expense of structural accuracy. This results in a distorted prosodic hierarchy where the native pattern is inverted.",

    "abstract": "Although Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) in Bengali has seen significant progress, processing long-duration audio and performing robust speaker diarization remain critical research gaps. To address the severe scarcity of joint ASR and diarization resources for this language, we introduce Lipi-Ghor-882, a comprehensive 882-hour multi-speaker Bengali dataset. In this paper, detailing our submission to the DL Sprint 4.0 competition, we systematically evaluate various architectures and approaches for long-form Bengali speech. For ASR, we demonstrate that raw data scaling is ineffective; instead, targeted fine-tuning utilizing perfectly aligned annotations paired with synthetic acoustic degradation (noise and reverberation) emerges as the singular most effective approach. Conversely, for speaker diarization, we observed that global open-source state-of-the-art models (such as Diarizen) performed surprisingly poorly on this complex dataset. Extensive model retraining yielded negligible improvements; instead, strategic, heuristic post-processing of baseline model outputs proved to be the primary driver for increasing accuracy. Ultimately, this work outlines a highly optimized dual pipeline achieving a $\\sim$0.019 Real-Time Factor (RTF), establishing a practical, empirically backed benchmark for low-resource, long-form speech processing.",

    "abstract": "Point cloud video understanding is critical for robotics as it accurately encodes motion and scene interaction. We recognize that 4D datasets are far scarcer than 3D ones, which hampers the scalability of self-supervised 4D models. A promising alternative is to transfer 3D pre-trained models to 4D perception tasks. However, rigorous empirical analysis reveals two critical limitations that impede transfer capability: overfitting and the modality gap. To overcome these challenges, we develop a novel \"Align then Adapt\" (PointATA) paradigm that decomposes parameter-efficient transfer learning into two sequential stages. Optimal-transport theory is employed to quantify the distributional discrepancy between 3D and 4D datasets, enabling our proposed point align embedder to be trained in Stage 1 to alleviate the underlying modality gap. To mitigate overfitting, an efficient point-video adapter and a spatial-context encoder are integrated into the frozen 3D backbone to enhance temporal modeling capacity in Stage 2. Notably, with the above engineering-oriented designs, PointATA enables a pre-trained 3D model without temporal knowledge to reason about dynamic video content at a smaller parameter cost compared to previous work. Extensive experiments show that PointATA can match or even outperform strong full fine-tuning models, whilst enjoying the advantage of parameter efficiency, e.g. 97.21 \\% accuracy on 3D action recognition, $+8.7 \\%$ on 4 D action segmentation, and 84.06\\% on 4D semantic segmentation.",

    "abstract": "Modern Text-to-Speech (TTS) systems increasingly leverage Large Language Model (LLM) architectures to achieve scalable, high-fidelity, zero-shot generation. However, these systems typically rely on fixed-frame-rate acoustic tokenization, resulting in speech sequences that are significantly longer than, and asynchronous with their corresponding text. Beyond computational inefficiency, this sequence length disparity often triggers hallucinations in TTS and amplifies the modality gap in spoken language modeling (SLM). In this paper, we propose a novel tokenization scheme that establishes one-to-one synchronization between continuous acoustic features and text tokens, enabling unified, single-stream modeling within an LLM. We demonstrate that these synchronous tokens maintain high-fidelity audio reconstruction and can be effectively modeled in a latent space by a large language model with a flow matching head. Moreover, the ability to seamlessly toggle speech modality within the context enables text-only guidance--a technique that blends logits from text-only and text-speech modes to flexibly bridge the gap toward text-only LLM intelligence. Experimental results indicate that our approach achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art TTS and SLM systems while virtually eliminating content hallucinations and preserving linguistic integrity, all at a significantly reduced inference cost.",

    "abstract": "The era of large astronomical surveys generates massive image catalogs requiring efficient and secure access, particularly during pre-publication periods where data confidentiality and integrity are paramount. While Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) principles guide the eventual public dissemination of data, traditional security methods for restricted phases often lack granularity or incur prohibitive performance penalties. To address this, we present a framework that integrates a flexible policy engine for fine-grained access control with a novel GPU-accelerated implementation of the AES-GCM authenticated encryption protocol.   The novelty of this work lies in the adaptation and optimization of a parallel tree-reduction strategy to overcome the main performance bottleneck in authenticated encryption on GPUs: the inherently sequential Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) authentication hash (GHASH). We present both the algorithmic adaptation and its efficient execution on GPU architectures. Although similar parallelization techniques have been explored in cryptographic research, this is, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of their integration into a high-throughput encryption framework specifically designed for large-scale astronomical data. Our implementation transforms the sequential GHASH computation into a highly parallelizable, logarithmic-time process, achieving authenticated encryption throughput suitable for petabyte-scale image analysis.   Our solution provides a robust mechanism for data providers to enforce access policies, ensuring both confidentiality and integrity without hindering research workflows, thereby facilitating a secure and managed transition of data to public, FAIR archives.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning (DL) libraries are widely used in critical applications, where even subtle silent bugs can lead to serious consequences. While existing DL fuzzing techniques have made progress in detecting crashes, they inherently struggle to detect silent bugs due to the lack of effective test programs and corresponding oracles.   Building on the observation that historical bug reports contain rich, underutilized information about silent bugs, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to perform versatile yet controlled bug transfer for silent bug fuzzing. Specifically, our approach uses LLMs to extract context-aware bug patterns from historical issues, match semantically related Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) using functionality-based embeddings, and synthesize test cases with customized oracles. This enables proactive detection of silent bugs by transferring high-risk contexts and oracle designs from known buggy APIs to functionally similar target APIs. To ensure the reliability of our context-aware bug transfer, we introduce an LLM-powered self-validation module that systematically evaluates the validity of each transferred bug instance. We implement this methodology in a tool named TransFuzz and evaluate it on three mainstream DL libraries: PyTorch, TensorFlow, and MindSpore. TransFuzz successfully discovers 79 previously unknown bugs (12 confirmed as Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs)) in 10 bug types, demonstrating its effectiveness and generalizability in migrating DL library bug discovery capabilities.",

However, there is a general scarcity of annotated CRF data, both for training and testing LLMs, which limits the progress on this task. As a step in the direction of providing such data, we present a new dataset of clinical notes from an Italian Emergency Department annotated with respect to a pre-defined CRF containing 134 items to be filled. We provide an analysis of the data, define the CRF-filling task and metric for its evaluation, and report on pilot experiments where we use an open-source state-of-the-art LLM to automatically execute the task. Results of the case-study show that (i) CRF-filling from real clinical notes in Italian can be approached in a zero-shot setting; (ii) LLMs' results are affected by biases (e.g., a cautious behaviour favours \"unknown\" answers), which need to be corrected.",

    "abstract": "Semi-structured documents integrate diverse interleaved data elements (e.g., tables, charts, hierarchical paragraphs) arranged in various and often irregular layouts. These documents are widely observed across domains and account for a large portion of real-world data. However, existing methods struggle to support natural language question answering over these documents due to three main technical challenges: (1) The elements extracted by techniques like OCR are often fragmented and stripped of their original semantic context, making them inadequate for analysis. (2) Existing approaches lack effective representations to capture hierarchical structures within documents (e.g., associating tables with nested chapter titles) and to preserve layout-specific distinctions (e.g., differentiating sidebars from main content). (3) Answering questions often requires retrieving and aligning relevant information scattered across multiple regions or pages, such as linking a descriptive paragraph to table cells located elsewhere in the document.   To address these issues, we propose MoDora, an LLM-powered system for semi-structured document analysis. First, we adopt a local-alignment aggregation strategy to convert OCR-parsed elements into layout-aware components, and conduct type-specific information extraction for components with hierarchical titles or non-text elements. Second, we design the Component-Correlation Tree (CCTree) to hierarchically organize components, explicitly modeling inter-component relations and layout distinctions through a bottom-up cascade summarization process. Finally, we propose a question-type-aware retrieval strategy that supports (1) layout-based grid partitioning for location-based retrieval and (2) LLM-guided pruning for semantic-based retrieval. Experiments show MoDora outperforms baselines by 5.97%-61.07% in accuracy. The code is at https://github.com/weAIDB/MoDora.",

    "abstract": "Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis is crucial for diagnosing heart disease, but most self-supervised learning methods treat ECG as a generic time series, overlooking physiologic semantics and rhythm-level structure. Existing contrastive methods utilize augmentations that distort morphology, whereas generative approaches employ fixed-window segmentation, which misaligns cardiac cycles. To address these limitations, we propose RhythmBERT, a generative ECG language model that considers ECG as a language paradigm by encoding P, QRS, and T segments into symbolic tokens via autoencoder-based latent representations. These discrete tokens capture rhythm semantics, while complementary continuous embeddings retain fine-grained morphology, enabling a unified view of waveform structure and rhythm. RhythmBERT is pretrained on approximately 800,000 unlabeled ECG recordings with a masked prediction objective, allowing it to learn contextual representations in a label-efficient manner. Evaluations show that despite using only a single lead, RhythmBERT achieves comparable or superior performance to strong 12-lead baselines. This generalization extends from prevalent conditions such as atrial fibrillation to clinically challenging cases such as subtle ST-T abnormalities and myocardial infarction. Our results suggest that considering ECG as structured language offers a scalable and physiologically aligned pathway for advancing cardiac analysis.",

    "abstract": "Transformer attention is typically implemented using softmax normalization, which enforces attention weights with unit sum normalization. While effective in many settings, this constraint can limit flexibility in controlling attention magnitudes and may contribute to overly concentrated or unstable attention patterns during training. Prior work has explored modifications such as attention sinks or gating mechanisms, but these approaches provide only limited or indirect control over attention reweighting. We propose Affine-Scaled Attention, a simple extension to standard attention that introduces input-dependent scaling and a corresponding bias term applied to softmax-normalized attention weights. This design relaxes the strict normalization constraint while maintaining aggregation of value representations, allowing the model to adjust both the relative distribution and the scale of attention in a controlled manner.   We empirically evaluate Affine-Scaled Attention in large-scale language model pretraining across multiple model sizes. Experimental results show consistent improvements in training stability, optimization behavior, and downstream task performance compared to standard softmax attention and attention sink baselines. These findings suggest that modest reweighting of attention outputs provides a practical and effective way to improve attention behavior in Transformer models.",

    "abstract": "In Formula 1, race strategies are adapted according to evolving race conditions and competitors' actions. This paper proposes a reinforcement learning approach for multi-agent race strategy optimization. Agents learn to balance energy management, tire degradation, aerodynamic interaction, and pit-stop decisions. Building on a pre-trained single-agent policy, we introduce an interaction module that accounts for the behavior of competitors. The combination of the interaction module and a self-play training scheme generates competitive policies, and agents are ranked based on their relative performance. Results show that the agents adapt pit timing, tire selection, and energy allocation in response to opponents, achieving robust and consistent race performance. Because the framework relies only on information available during real races, it can support race strategists' decisions before and during races.",

We deal with unbounded client-server systems (UCS) where all clients are of the same type, interact with a single server and they may enter and exit the system dynamically. At any point in time, the number of clients is bounded, but their exact number is unknown and dynamic. To model these systems, simple Petri nets are not directly usable, so we use unbounded $ν$-nets. Owing to the distinguishability of clients in UCS, it is not straightforward to express their properties in LTL or CTL.

    "abstract": "This paper presents the Marinarium, a modular and stand-alone underwater research facility designed to provide a realistic testbed for maritime and space-analog robotic experimentation in a resource-efficient manner. The Marinarium combines a fully instrumented underwater and aerial operational volume, extendable via a retractable roof for real-weather conditions, a digital twin in the SMaRCSim simulator and tight integration with a space robotics laboratory. All of these result from design choices aimed at bridging simulation, laboratory validation, and field conditions. We compare the Marinarium to similar existing infrastructures and illustrate how its design enables a set of experiments in four open research areas within field robotics. First, we exploit high-fidelity dynamics data from the tank to demonstrate the potential of learning-based system identification approaches applied to underwater vehicles. We further highlight the versatility of the multi-domain operating volume via a rendezvous mission with a heterogeneous fleet of robots across underwater, surface, and air. We then illustrate how the presented digital twin can be utilized to reduce the reality gap in underwater simulation. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of underwater surrogates for spacecraft navigation validation by executing spatiotemporally identical inspection tasks on a planar space-robot emulator and a neutrally buoyant \\gls{rov}. In this work, by sharing the insights obtained and rationale behind the design and construction of the Marinarium, we hope to provide the field robotics research community with a blueprint for bridging the gap between controlled and real offshore and space robotics experimentation.",

    "abstract": "Occlusions present a significant challenge for connected and automated vehicles, as they can obscure critical road users from perception systems. Traditional risk metrics often fail to capture the cumulative nature of these threats over time adequately. In this paper, we propose a novel and universal risk assessment metric, the Risk of Tracking Loss (RTL), which aggregates instantaneous risk intensity throughout occluded periods. This provides a holistic risk profile that encompasses both high-intensity, short-term threats and prolonged exposure. Utilizing diverse and high-fidelity real-world datasets, a large-scale statistical analysis is conducted to characterize occlusion risk and validate the effectiveness of the proposed metric. The metric is applied to evaluate different vehicle-to-everything (V2X) deployment strategies. Our study shows that full V2X penetration theoretically eliminates this risk, the reduction is highly nonlinear; a substantial statistical benefit requires a high penetration threshold of 75-90%. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel asymmetric communication framework that allows even non-connected vehicles to receive warnings. Experimental results demonstrate that this paradigm achieves better risk mitigation performance. We found that our approach at 25% penetration outperforms the traditional symmetric model at 75%, and benefits saturate at only 50% penetration. This work provides a crucial risk assessment metric and a cost-effective, strategic roadmap for accelerating the safety benefits of V2X deployment.",

    "abstract": "Context engineering has emerged as a pivotal paradigm for unlocking the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Software Engineering (SE) tasks, enabling performance gains at test time without model fine-tuning. Despite its success, existing research lacks a systematic taxonomy of SE-specific context types and a dedicated benchmark to quantify the heterogeneous effects of different contexts across core SE workflows. To address this gap, we propose CL4SE (Context Learning for Software Engineering), a comprehensive benchmark featuring a fine-grained taxonomy of four SE-oriented context types (interpretable examples, project-specific context, procedural decision-making context, and positive & negative context), each mapped to a representative task (code generation, code summarization, code review, and patch correctness assessment). We construct high-quality datasets comprising over 13,000 samples from more than 30 open-source projects and evaluate five mainstream LLMs across nine metrics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that context learning yields an average performance improvement of 24.7% across all tasks. Specifically, procedural context boosts code review performance by up to 33% (Qwen3-Max), mixed positive-negative context improves patch assessment by 30% (DeepSeek-V3), project-specific context increases code summarization BLEU by 14.78% (GPT-Oss-120B), and interpretable examples enhance code generation PASS@1 by 5.72% (DeepSeek-V3). CL4SE establishes the first standardized evaluation framework for SE context learning, provides actionable empirical insights into task-specific context design, and releases a large-scale dataset to facilitate reproducible research in this domain.",

Existing Gaussian Splatting based methods achieve high-quality reconstruction but break down on long sequences, temporal inconsistency, and fail under large motions and disocclusions. Moreover, their outputs are typically incompatible with conventional video coding pipelines, preventing practical applications.   We introduce PackUV, a novel 4D Gaussian representation that maps all Gaussian attributes into a sequence of structured, multi-scale UV atlas, enabling compact, image-native storage. To fit this representation from multi-view videos, we propose PackUV-GS, a temporally consistent fitting method that directly optimizes Gaussian parameters in the UV domain. A flow-guided Gaussian labeling and video keyframing module identifies dynamic Gaussians, stabilizes static regions, and preserves temporal coherence even under large motions and disocclusions. The resulting UV atlas format is the first unified volumetric video representation compatible with standard video codecs (e.g., FFV1) without losing quality, enabling efficient streaming within existing multimedia infrastructure.   To evaluate long-duration volumetric capture, we present PackUV-2B, the largest multi-view video dataset to date, featuring more than 50 synchronized cameras, substantial motion, and frequent disocclusions across 100 sequences and 2B (billion) frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses existing baselines in rendering fidelity while scaling to sequences up to 30 minutes with consistent quality.",

    "abstract": "Combinatorial optimization problems are crucial in industry. However, many COPs are NP-hard, causing the search space to grow exponentially with problem size and rendering large-scale instances computationally intractable. Conventional solvers typically treat problems as monolithic entities, leading to significant efficiency degradation as structural complexity increases. To address this issue, we propose a novel search-space decomposition method that leverages the inherent structure of variables to systematically reduce the size of the master problem. We formulate interaction costs between variables and individual variable costs as a constrained maximum cut problem and convert it into a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization formulation using penalty terms. An Ising-model solver is used to rapidly decompose the problem into independent small-scale subproblems, which are subsequently solved in parallel using mathematical optimization solvers. We validated this method on the capacitated vehicle routing problem. Results demonstrate three significant benefits: a substantial enhancement in feasible solution rates, accelerated convergence, achieving in 1 min the accuracy that the naive method required 30 min to reach, and a variable reduction of up to 95.32\\%. These findings suggest that search-space decomposition is a promising strategy for efficiently solving large-scale combinatorial optimization problems.",

    "abstract": "Large language model (LLM) serving infrastructures are undergoing a shift toward heterogeneity and disaggregation. Modern deployments increasingly integrate diverse accelerators and near-memory processing technologies, introducing significant hardware heterogeneity, while system software increasingly separates computation, memory, and model components across distributed resources to improve scalability and efficiency. As a result, LLM serving performance is no longer determined by hardware or software choices in isolation, but by their runtime interaction through scheduling, data movement, and interconnect behavior. However, understanding these interactions remains challenging, as existing simulators lack the ability to jointly model heterogeneous hardware and disaggregated serving techniques within a unified, runtime-driven framework.   This paper presents LLMServingSim 2.0, a unified system-level simulator designed to make runtime-driven hardware-software interactions in heterogeneous and disaggregated LLM serving infrastructures explicit and analyzable. LLMServingSim 2.0 embeds serving decisions and hardware behavior into a single runtime loop, enabling interaction-aware modeling of batching, routing, offloading, memory, and power. The simulator supports extensible integration of emerging accelerators and memory systems through profile-based modeling, while capturing dynamic serving behavior and system-level effects. We validate LLMServingSim 2.0 against real deployments, showing that it reproduces key performance, memory, and power metrics with an average error of 0.97%, while maintaining simulation times of around 10 minutes even for complex configurations. These results demonstrate that LLMServingSim 2.0 provides a practical bridge between hardware innovation and serving-system design, enabling systematic exploration and co-design for next-generation LLM serving infrastructures.",

    "abstract": "Cardiac blood flow patterns contain rich information about disease severity and clinical interventions, yet current imaging and computational methods fail to capture underlying relational structures of coherent flow features. We propose a physics-informed, latent relational framework to model cardiac vortices as interacting nodes in a graph. Our model combines a neural relational inference architecture with physics-inspired interaction energy and birth-death dynamics, yielding a latent graph sensitive to disease severity and intervention level. We first apply this to computational fluid dynamics simulations of aortic coarctation. Learned latent graphs reveal that as the aortic radius narrows, vortex interactions become stronger and more frequent. This leads to a higher graph entropy, correlating monotonically with coarctation severity ($R^2=0.78$, Spearman $|ρ|=0.96$). We then extend this method to ultrasound datasets of left ventricles under varying levels of left ventricular assist device support. Again the latent graph representation captures the weakening of coherent vortical structures, thereby demonstrating cross-modal generalisation. Results show latent interaction graphs and entropy serve as robust and interpretable markers of cardiac disease and intervention.",

    "abstract": "Detecting objects in aerial images confronts some significant challenges, including small size, dense and non-uniform distribution of objects over high-resolution images, which makes detection inefficient. Thus, in this paper, we proposed a small object detection algorithm based on a Spatial Laplacian Pyramid Attention and Multi-Scale Feature Enhancement in aerial images. Firstly, in order to improve the feature representation of ResNet-50 on small objects, we presented a novel Spatial Laplacian Pyramid Attention (SLPA) module, which is integrated after each stage of ResNet-50 to identify and emphasize important local regions. Secondly, to enhance the model's semantic understanding and features representation, we designed a Multi-Scale Feature Enhancement Module (MSFEM), which is incorporated into the lateral connections of C5 layer for building Feature Pyramid Network (FPN). Finally, the features representation quality of traditional feature pyramid network will be affected because the features are not aligned when the upper and lower layers are fused. In order to handle it, we utilized deformable convolutions to align the features in the fusion processing of the upper and lower levels of the Feature Pyramid Network, which can help enhance the model's ability to detect and recognize small objects. The extensive experimental results on two benchmark datasets: VisDrone and DOTA demonstrate that our improved model performs better for small object detection in aerial images compared to the original algorithm.",

    "abstract": "Finite-state independence is a robust notion of algorithmic independence for infinite words. It was introduced for general infinite words by Becher, Carton, and Heiber via deterministic asynchronous two-tape finite automata. Álvarez, Becher, and Carton then studied the normal case and characterized finite-state independence in terms of deterministic finite-state shufflers. A shuffler is a finite automaton that reads from two input tapes $x,y\\inΣ^\\infty$ and, at each step, chooses one tape to read next, outputs the symbol read, and updates its state based only on that output symbol. In terms of this characterization, two normal sources are finite-state independent if every deterministic finite-state way of shuffling (interleaving) them still produces a normal sequence. Álvarez, Becher, and Carton posed the following questions: (1) can one compute finite-state independent normal pairs efficiently, improving their doubly-exponential procedure; and (2) given a normal word $x$, can one effectively construct a normal word $y$ that is finite-state independent from $x$?   We answer both questions by explicit deterministic constructions. First, we give a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm that, on input $N$, outputs the first $N$ symbols of two normal words $x$ and $y$ such that for every shuffler $S$, the shuffled output $S(x,y)$ is normal; hence $(x,y)$ is finite-state independent.   Second, we solve the one-sided companion problem effectively. Given any computable normal word $x\\inΣ^\\infty$, we give an explicit deterministic construction of a computable normal word $y\\inΣ^\\infty$ such that for every shuffler $S$, the shuffled output $S(x,y)$ is normal. In particular, $x$ and $y$ are finite-state independent by the shuffler characterization theorem.",

    "abstract": "Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval (ZS-CIR) aims to retrieve target images given a multimodal query (comprising a reference image and a modification text), without training on annotated triplets. Existing methods typically convert the multimodal query into a single modality-either as an edited caption for Text-to-Image retrieval (T2I) or as an edited image for Image-to-Image retrieval (I2I). However, each paradigm has inherent limitations: T2I often loses fine-grained visual details, while I2I struggles with complex semantic modifications. To effectively leverage their complementary strengths under diverse query intents, we propose WISER, a training-free framework that unifies T2I and I2I via a \"retrieve-verify-refine\" pipeline, explicitly modeling intent awareness and uncertainty awareness. Specifically, WISER first performs Wider Search by generating both edited captions and images for parallel retrieval to broaden the candidate pool. Then, it conducts Adaptive Fusion with a verifier to assess retrieval confidence, triggering refinement for uncertain retrievals, and dynamically fusing the dual-path for reliable ones. For uncertain retrievals, WISER generates refinement suggestions through structured self-reflection to guide the next retrieval round toward Deeper Thinking. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WISER significantly outperforms previous methods across multiple benchmarks, achieving relative improvements of 45% on CIRCO (mAP@5) and 57% on CIRR (Recall@1) over existing training-free methods. Notably, it even surpasses many training-dependent methods, highlighting its superiority and generalization under diverse scenarios. Code will be released at https://github.com/Physicsmile/WISER.",

    "abstract": "We study budget aggregation under $\\ell_1$-utilities, a model for collective decision making in which agents with heterogeneous preferences must allocate a public budget across a set of alternatives. Each agent reports their preferred allocation, and a mechanism selects an allocation. Early work focused on social welfare maximization, which in this setting admits truthful mechanisms, but may underrepresent minority groups, motivating the study of proportional mechanisms. However, the dominant proportionality notion, single-minded proportionality, is weak, as it only constrains outcomes when agents hold extreme preferences. To better understand proportionality and its interaction with welfare and truthfulness, we address three questions. First, how much welfare must be sacrificed to achieve proportionality? We formalize this via the price of proportionality, the best worst-case welfare ratio between a proportional mechanism and Util, the welfare-maximizing mechanism. We introduce a new single-minded proportional and truthful mechanism, UtilProp, and show that it achieves the optimal worst-case ratio. Second, how do proportional mechanisms compare in terms of welfare? We define an instance-wise welfare dominance relation and use it to compare mechanisms from the literature. In particular, we show that UtilProp welfare-dominates all previously known single-minded proportional and truthful mechanisms. Third, can stronger notions of proportionality be achieved without compromising welfare guarantees? We answer this question in the affirmative by studying decomposability and proposing GreedyDecomp, a decomposable mechanism with optimal worst-case welfare ratio. We further show that computing the welfare-dominant decomposable mechanism, UtilDecomp, is NP-hard, and that GreedyDecomp provides a 2-approximation to UtilDecomp in terms of welfare.",

    "title": "Fairness in Limited Resources Settings",
    "abstract": "In recent years many important societal decisions are made by machine-learning algorithms, and many such important decisions have strict capacity limits, allowing resources to be allocated only to the highest utility individuals. For example, allocating physician appointments to the patients most likely to have some medical condition, or choosing which children will attend a special program. When performing such decisions, we consider both the prediction aspect of the decision and the resource allocation aspect. In this work we focus on the fairness of the decisions in such settings. The fairness aspect here is critical as the resources are limited, and allocating the resources to one individual leaves less resources for others. When the decision involves prediction together with the resource allocation, there is a risk that information gaps between different populations will lead to a very unbalanced allocation of resources.   We address settings by adapting definitions from resource allocation schemes, identifying connections between the algorithmic fairness definitions and resource allocation ones, and examining the trade-offs between fairness and utility. We analyze the price of enforcing the different fairness definitions compared to a strictly utility-based optimization of the predictor, and show that it can be unbounded. We introduce an adaptation of proportional fairness and show that it has a bounded price of fairness, indicating greater robustness, and propose a variant of equal opportunity that also has a bounded price of fairness.",

    "abstract": "Whole-body mobile manipulation is a fundamental capability for general-purpose robotic agents, requiring both coordinated control of the mobile base and manipulator and robust perception under dynamically changing viewpoints. However, existing approaches face two key challenges: strong coupling between base and arm actions complicates whole-body control optimization, and perceptual attention is often poorly allocated as viewpoints shift during mobile manipulation. We propose InCoM, an intent-driven perception and structured coordination framework for whole-body mobile manipulation. InCoM infers latent motion intent to dynamically reweight multi-scale perceptual features, enabling stage-adaptive allocation of perceptual attention. To support robust cross-modal perception, InCoM further incorporates a geometric-semantic structured alignment mechanism that enhances multimodal correspondence. On the control side, we design a decoupled coordinated flow matching action decoder that explicitly models coordinated base-arm action generation, alleviating optimization difficulties caused by control coupling. Without access to privileged perceptual information, InCoM outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three ManiSkill-HAB scenarios by 28.2%, 26.1%, and 23.6% in success rate, demonstrating strong effectiveness for whole-body mobile manipulation.",

Specifically, we investigate the requisite minimal distance $Δ$ between mean vectors to partially recover the underlying partition. While the minimax-optimal threshold for $Δ$ is well-established, a significant gap exists between this information-theoretic limit and the performance of known polynomial-time procedures. Although this gap was recently characterized in the high-dimensional regime ($n \\leq dK$), it remains largely unexplored in the moderate-dimensional regime ($n \\geq dK$). In this manuscript, we address this regime by establishing a new low-degree polynomial lower bound for the moderate-dimensional case when $d \\geq K$. We show that while the difficulty of clustering for $n \\leq dK$ is primarily driven by dimension reduction and spectral methods, the moderate-dimensional regime involves more delicate phenomena leading to a \"non-parametric rate\". We provide a novel non-spectral algorithm matching this rate, shedding new light on the computational limits of the clustering problem in moderate dimension.",

However, this technique is susceptible to common challenges such as occlusions and illumination variations, leading to degraded alignment visual quality and compromised accuracy in downstream tasks. In this paper, we present DMAligner, a diffusion-based framework for image alignment through alignment-oriented view synthesis. DMAligner is crafted to tackle the challenges in image alignment from a new perspective, employing a generation-based solution that showcases strong capabilities and avoids the problems associated with flow-based image warping. Specifically, we propose a Dynamics-aware Diffusion Training approach for learning conditional image generation, synthesizing a novel view for image alignment. This incorporates a Dynamics-aware Mask Producing (DMP) module to adaptively distinguish dynamic foreground regions from static backgrounds, enabling the diffusion model to more effectively handle challenges that classical methods struggle to solve. Furthermore, we develop the Dynamic Scene Image Alignment (DSIA) dataset using Blender, which includes 1,033 indoor and outdoor scenes with over 30K image pairs tailored for image alignment. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach on DSIA benchmarks, as well as on a series of widely-used video datasets for qualitative comparisons.

    "abstract": "Despite recent advancements, existing prosthetic limbs are unable to replicate the dexterity and intuitive control of the human hand. Current control systems for prosthetic hands are often limited to grasping, and commercial prosthetic hands lack the precision needed for dexterous manipulation or applications that require fine finger motions. Thus, there is a critical need for accessible and replicable prosthetic designs that enable individuals to interact with electronic devices and perform precise finger pressing, such as keyboard typing or piano playing, while preserving current prosthetic capabilities. This paper presents a low-cost, lightweight, 3D-printed robotic prosthetic hand, specifically engineered for enhanced dexterity with electronic devices such as a computer keyboard or piano, as well as general object manipulation. The robotic hand features a mechanism to adjust finger abduction/adduction spacing, a 2-D wrist with the inclusion of controlled ulnar/radial deviation optimized for typing, and control of independent finger pressing. We conducted a study to demonstrate how participants can use the robotic hand to perform keyboard typing and piano playing in real time, with different levels of finger and wrist motion. This supports the notion that our proposed design can allow for the execution of key typing motions more effectively than before, aiming to enhance the functionality of prosthetic hands.",

    "abstract": "Detecting visual anomalies in industrial inspection often requires training with only a few normal images per category. Recent few-shot methods achieve strong results employing foundation-model features, but typically rely on memory banks, auxiliary datasets, or multi-modal tuning of vision-language models. We therefore question whether such complexity is necessary given the feature representations of vision foundation models. To answer this question, we introduce SubspaceAD, a training-free method, that operates in two simple stages. First, patch-level features are extracted from a small set of normal images by a frozen DINOv2 backbone. Second, a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) model is fit to these features to estimate the low-dimensional subspace of normal variations. At inference, anomalies are detected via the reconstruction residual with respect to this subspace, producing interpretable and statistically grounded anomaly scores. Despite its simplicity, SubspaceAD achieves state-of-the-art performance across one-shot and few-shot settings without training, prompt tuning, or memory banks. In the one-shot anomaly detection setting, SubspaceAD achieves image-level and pixel-level AUROC of 98.0% and 97.6% on the MVTec-AD dataset, and 93.3% and 98.3% on the VisA dataset, respectively, surpassing prior state-of-the-art results.

    "abstract": "Continuous value prediction plays a crucial role in industrial-scale recommendation systems, including tasks such as predicting users' watch-time and estimating the gross merchandise value (GMV) in e-commerce transactions. However, it remains challenging due to the highly complex and long-tailed nature of the data distributions. Existing generative approaches rely on rigid parametric distribution assumptions, which fundamentally limits their performance when such assumptions misalign with real-world data. Overly simplified forms cannot adequately model real-world complexities, while more intricate assumptions often suffer from poor scalability and generalization.   To address these challenges, we propose a residual quantization (RQ)-based sequence learning framework that represents target continuous values as a sum of ordered quantization codes, predicted recursively from coarse to fine granularity with diminishing quantization errors. We introduce a representation learning objective that aligns RQ code embedding space with the ordinal structure of target values, allowing the model to capture continuous representations for quantization codes and further improving prediction accuracy. We perform extensive evaluations on public benchmarks for lifetime value (LTV) and watch-time prediction, alongside a large-scale online experiment for GMV prediction on an industrial short-video recommendation platform. The results consistently show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, while demonstrating strong generalization across diverse continuous value prediction tasks in recommendation systems.",

Spectral methods address this challenge by exploiting the Fourier representation, treating the spectral density as a probability distribution for Monte Carlo approximation. Although this probabilistic interpretation works for stationary processes, it is overly restrictive for the nonstationary case, where spectral densities are generally not probability measures. We propose regular Fourier features for harmonizable processes that avoid this limitation. Our method discretizes the spectral representation directly, preserving the correlation structure among spectral weights without requiring probability assumptions. Under a finite spectral support assumption, this yields an efficient low-rank approximation that is positive semi-definite by construction. When the spectral density is unknown, the framework extends naturally to kernel learning from data. We demonstrate the method on locally stationary kernels and on harmonizable mixture kernels with complex-valued spectral densities.",

    "abstract": "Applying LLM-based multi-agent software systems in safety-critical domains such as lifespan echocardiography introduces system-level risks that cannot be addressed by improving model accuracy alone. During system operation, beyond individual LLM behavior, uncertainty propagates through agent coordination, data pipelines, human-in-the-loop interaction, and runtime control logic. Yet existing work largely treats uncertainty at the model level rather than as a first-class software engineering concern. This paper approaches uncertainty from both system-level and runtime perspectives. We first differentiate epistemological and ontological uncertainties in the context of LLM-based multi-agent software system operation. Building on this foundation, we propose a lifecycle-based uncertainty management framework comprising four mechanisms: representation, identification, evolution, and adaptation. The uncertainty lifecycle governs how uncertainties emerge, transform, and are mitigated across architectural layers and execution phases, enabling structured runtime governance and controlled adaptation. We demonstrate the feasibility of the framework using a real-world LLM-based multi-agent echocardiographic software system developed in clinical collaboration, showing improved reliability and diagnosability in diagnostic reasoning. The proposed approach generalizes to other safety-critical LLM-based multi-agent software systems, supporting principled operational control and runtime assurance beyond model-centric methods.",

    "abstract": "The use of hearing aids will increase in the coming years due to demographic change. One open problem that remains to be solved by a new generation of hearing aids is the cocktail party problem. A possible solution is electroencephalography-based auditory attention decoding. This has been the subject of several studies in recent years, which have in common that they use the same preprocessing methods in most cases. In this work, in order to achieve an advantage, the use of a scattering transform is proposed as an alternative to these preprocessing methods. The two-layer scattering transform is compared with a regular filterbank, the synchrosqueezing short-time Fourier transform and the common preprocessing. To demonstrate the performance, the known and the proposed preprocessing methods are compared for different classification tasks on two widely used datasets, provided by the KU Leuven (KUL) and the Technical University of Denmark (DTU). Both established and new neural-network-based models, CNNs, LSTMs, and recent Transformer/graph-based models are used for classification. Various evaluation strategies were compared, with a focus on the task of classifying speakers who are unknown from the training. We show that the two-layer scattering transform can significantly improve the performance for subject-related conditions, especially on the KUL dataset. However, on the DTU dataset, this only applies to some of the models, or when larger amounts of training data are provided, as in 10-fold cross-validation. This suggests that the scattering transform is capable of extracting additional relevant information.",

Beyond establishing optimal convergence rates, the numerical investigation identifies the requirements necessary to recover high-order accuracy in practice, including geometric regularity of the enclosing interface, accurate kernel quadrature, and compatible trace spaces for the source-reaction coupling.",

    "title": "Understanding Older Adults' Experiences of Support, Concerns, and Risks from Kinship-Role AI-Generated Influencers",
    "abstract": "AI-generated influencers are rapidly gaining popularity on Chinese short-video platforms, often adopting kinship-based roles such as AI grandchildren to attract older adults. Although this trend has raised public concern, little is known about the design strategies behind these influencers, how older adults experience them, and the benefits and risks involved. In this study, we combined social media analysis with interviews to unpack the above questions. Our findings show that influencers use both visual and conversational cues to enact kinship roles, prompting audiences to engage in kinship-based role-play. Interviews further show that these cues arouse emotional resonance, help fulfill older adults' informational and emotional needs, while also raising concerns about emotional displacement and unequal emotional investment. We highlight the complex relationship between virtual avatars and real family ties, shaped by broader sociocultural norms, and discuss how AI might strengthen social support for older adults while mitigating risks within cultural contexts.",

    "title": "Residual Koopman Spectral Profiling for Predicting and Preventing Transformer Training Instability",
    "abstract": "Training divergence in transformers wastes compute, yet practitioners discover instability only after expensive runs begin. They therefore need an expected probability of failure for a transformer before training starts. Our study of Residual Koopman Spectral Profiling (RKSP) provides such an estimate. From a single forward pass at initialization, RKSP extracts Koopman spectral features by applying whitened dynamic mode decomposition to layer-wise residual snapshots. Our central diagnostic, the near-unit spectral mass, quantifies the fraction of modes concentrated near the unit circle, which captures instability risk. For predicting divergence across extensive configurations, this estimator achieves an AUROC of 0.995, outperforming the best gradient baseline. We further make this diagnostic actionable through Koopman Spectral Shaping (KSS), which reshapes spectra during training. We empirically validate that our method works in practice: RKSP predicts divergence at initialization, and when RKSP flags high risk, turning on KSS successfully prevents divergence. In the challenging high learning rate regime without normalization layers, KSS reduces the divergence rate from 66.7% to 12.5% and enables learning rates that are 50% to 150% higher. These findings generalize to WikiText-103 language modeling, vision transformers on CIFAR-10, and pretrained language models, including GPT-2 and LLaMA-2 up to 7B, as well as emerging architectures such as MoE, Mamba-style SSMs, and KAN.",

The proposed measure extends integrated $R^2$ from scalar responses to responses taking values on general spaces equipped with a characteristic kernel, allowing to measure dependence of multivariate, functional, and structured data, while remaining sensitive to tail behaviour and oscillatory dependence structures. We establish that (i) this new measure takes values in $[0,1]$, (ii) equals zero if and only if independence holds, and (iii) equals one if and only if the response is almost surely a measurable function of the covariates. Two estimators are proposed: a graph-based method using $K$-nearest neighbours and an RKHS-based method built on conditional mean embeddings. We prove consistency and derive convergence rates for the graph-based estimator, showing its adaptation to intrinsic dimensionality. Numerical experiments on simulated data and a real data experiment in the context of dependency testing for media annotations demonstrate competitive power against state-of-the-art dependence measures, particularly in settings involving non-linear and structured relationships.",

    "abstract": "As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used, their security risks have drawn increasing attention. Existing research reveals that LLMs are highly susceptible to jailbreak attacks, with effectiveness varying across language contexts. This paper investigates the role of classical Chinese in jailbreak attacks. Owing to its conciseness and obscurity, classical Chinese can partially bypass existing safety constraints, exposing notable vulnerabilities in LLMs. Based on this observation, this paper proposes a framework, CC-BOS, for the automatic generation of classical Chinese adversarial prompts based on multi-dimensional fruit fly optimization, facilitating efficient and automated jailbreak attacks in black-box settings. Prompts are encoded into eight policy dimensions-covering role, behavior, mechanism, metaphor, expression, knowledge, trigger pattern and context; and iteratively refined via smell search, visual search, and cauchy mutation. This design enables efficient exploration of the search space, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of black-box jailbreak attacks. To enhance readability and evaluation accuracy, we further design a classical Chinese to English translation module. Extensive experiments demonstrate that effectiveness of the proposed CC-BOS, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art jailbreak attack methods.",

Among recent advances in deep learning for EEG, geometric learning stands out as its theoretical underpinnings on symmetric positive definite (SPD) allows revealing structural connectivity analysis in a physics-grounded manner. However, current SPD-based methods focus predominantly on statistical aggregation of EEGs, with frequency-specific synchronization and local topological structures of brain regions neglected. Given this, we propose RepSPD, a novel geometric deep learning (GDL)-based model. RepSPD implements a cross-attention mechanism on the Riemannian manifold to modulate the geometric attributes of SPD with graph-derived functional connectivity features. On top of this, we introduce a global bidirectional alignment strategy to reshape tangent-space embeddings, mitigating geometric distortions caused by curvature and thereby enhancing geometric consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly outperforms existing EEG representation methods, exhibiting superior robustness and generalization capabilities.",

    "abstract": "Counting immunopositive cells on biological tissues generally requires either manual annotation or (when available) automatic rough systems, for scanning signal surface and intensity in whole slide imaging. In this work, we tackle the problem of counting microglial cells in lumbar spinal cord cross-sections of rats by omitting cell detection and focusing only on the counting task. Manual cell counting is, however, a time-consuming task and additionally entails extensive personnel training. The classic automatic color-based methods roughly inform about the total labeled area and intensity (protein quantification) but do not specifically provide information on cell number. Since the images to be analyzed have a high resolution but a huge amount of pixels contain just noise or artifacts, we first perform a pre-processing generating several filtered images {(providing a tailored, efficient feature extraction)}. Then, we design an automatic kernel counter that is a non-parametric and non-linear method. The proposed scheme can be easily trained in small datasets since, in its basic version, it relies only on one hyper-parameter. However, being non-parametric and non-linear, the proposed algorithm is flexible enough to express all the information contained in rich and heterogeneous datasets as well (providing the maximum overfit if required). Furthermore, the proposed kernel counter also provides uncertainty estimation of the given prediction, and can directly tackle the case of receiving several expert opinions over the same image. Different numerical experiments with artificial and real datasets show very promising results. Related Matlab code is also provided.",

The inference pipeline integrates a vision-enabled large language model, BERT- based medical entity extraction, and a Sequential Language Model Inference (SLMI) step to enforce domain-consistent refinement prior to expert review. Evaluation on 21 dermatological cases (21 complete AI physician pairs) em- ployed a four-level concordance framework comprising exact primary match rate (PMR), semantic similarity-adjusted rate (AMR), cross-category alignment, and Comprehensive Concordance Rate (CCR). Exact agreement reached 71.4% and remained unchanged under semantic similarity (t = 0.60), while structured cross-category and differential overlap analysis yielded 100% comprehensive concordance (95% CI: [83.9%, 100%]). No cases demonstrated complete diagnostic divergence. These findings show that binary lexical evaluation substantially un- derestimates clinically meaningful alignment.

To accurately and objectively evaluate the performance of the LLMs, we introduce the Strict Imperfection Penalty F1 (SIP-F1) score. This metric not only establishes a rigorous capability hierarchy but also, for the first time, quantifies model \"personalities\" (Conservative, Aggressive, Gambler, or Wise). By correlating these results with model-reported confidence and perceived difficulty, we expose the true reasoning boundaries of current AI in complex physical scenarios.

We introduce Certified Circuits, which provide provable stability guarantees for circuit discovery. Our framework wraps any black-box discovery algorithm with randomized data subsampling to certify that circuit component inclusion decisions are invariant to bounded edit-distance perturbations of the concept dataset. Unstable neurons are abstained from, yielding circuits that are more compact and more accurate. On ImageNet and OOD datasets, certified circuits achieve up to 91% higher accuracy while using 45% fewer neurons, and remain reliable where baselines degrade. Certified Circuits puts circuit discovery on formal ground by producing mechanistic explanations that are provably stable and better aligned with the target concept. Code will be released soon!",

However, the quantities involved in this type of selection cannot be considered as Bayesian evidences: we suggest to use the name ``fake evidences'' (or ``areas under the likelihood'' in the case of uniform improper priors). We also show that, in this model selection scenario, using a diffuse prior and increasing its scale parameter asymptotically to infinity, we cannot recover the value of the area under the likelihood, obtained with a uniform improper prior. We first discuss it from a general point of view. Then we provide, as an applicative example, all the details for Bayesian regression models with nonlinear bases, considering two cases: the use of a uniform improper prior and the use of a Gaussian prior, respectively.

To address these limitations, we propose FactGuard, an agentic framework for video misinformation detection that formulates verification as an iterative reasoning process built upon MLLMs. FactGuard explicitly assesses task ambiguity and selectively invokes external tools to acquire critical evidence, enabling progressive refinement of reasoning trajectories. To further strengthen this capability, we introduce a two-stage training strategy that combines domain-specific agentic supervised fine-tuning with decision-aware reinforcement learning to optimize tool usage and calibrate risk-sensitive decision making.

We investigate the relationship between model performance (validation loss) and three key factors: model size ($N$), dataset size ($D$), and compute budget ($C$). Across a range of models, we find that Aurora exhibits the strongest data-scaling behavior: increasing the training dataset by 10x reduces validation loss by up to 3.2x. GraphCast demonstrates the highest parameter efficiency, yet suffers from limited hardware utilization. Our compute-optimal analysis indicates that, under fixed compute budgets, allocating resources to longer training durations yields greater performance gains than increasing model size. Furthermore, we analyze model shape and uncover scaling behaviors that differ fundamentally from those observed in language models: weather forecasting models consistently favor increased width over depth. These findings suggest that future weather models should prioritize wider architectures and larger effective training datasets to maximize predictive performance.",

    "title": "UCM: Unifying Camera Control and Memory with Time-aware Positional Encoding Warping for World Models",
    "abstract": "World models based on video generation demonstrate remarkable potential for simulating interactive environments but face persistent difficulties in two key areas: maintaining long-term content consistency when scenes are revisited and enabling precise camera control from user-provided inputs. Existing methods based on explicit 3D reconstruction often compromise flexibility in unbounded scenarios and fine-grained structures. Alternative methods rely directly on previously generated frames without establishing explicit spatial correspondence, thereby constraining controllability and consistency. To address these limitations, we present UCM, a novel framework that unifies long-term memory and precise camera control via a time-aware positional encoding warping mechanism. To reduce computational overhead, we design an efficient dual-stream diffusion transformer for high-fidelity generation. Moreover, we introduce a scalable data curation strategy utilizing point-cloud-based rendering to simulate scene revisiting, facilitating training on over 500K monocular videos. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic benchmarks demonstrate that UCM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in long-term scene consistency, while also achieving precise camera controllability in high-fidelity video generation.",

    "abstract": "The rapid progress of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has led to increasing interest in agent-based systems. While most prior work in medical imaging concentrates on automating routine clinical workflows, we study an underexplored yet clinically significant setting: distinguishing visually hard-to-separate diseases in a zero-shot setting. We benchmark representative agents on two imaging-only proxy diagnostic tasks, (1) melanoma vs. atypical nevus and (2) pulmonary edema vs. pneumonia, where visual features are highly confounded despite substantial differences in clinical management. We introduce a multi-agent framework based on contrastive adjudication. Experimental results show improved diagnostic performance (an 11-percentage-point gain in accuracy on dermoscopy data) and reduced unsupported claims on qualitative samples, although overall performance remains insufficient for clinical deployment. We acknowledge the inherent uncertainty in human annotations and the absence of clinical context, which further limit the translation to real-world settings. Within this controlled setting, this pilot study provides preliminary insights into zero-shot agent performance in visually confounded scenarios.",

The method tokenizes text with Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), reorders the vocabulary so that frequent tokens receive small integer identifiers, and encodes the result with variable-length integers before passing it to any standard compressor. On enwik8 (100 MB Wikipedia), this yields improvements of 7.08 percentage points (pp) for zlib, 1.69 pp for LZMA, and 0.76 pp for zstd (all including vocabulary overhead), outperforming the classical Word Replacing Transform. Gains are consistent at 1 GB scale (enwik9) and across Chinese and Arabic text. We further show that preprocessing accelerates compression for computationally expensive algorithms: the total wall-clock time including preprocessing is 3.1x faster than raw zstd-22 and 2.4x faster than raw LZMA, because the preprocessed input is substantially smaller. The method can be implemented in under 50 lines of code.",

    "abstract": "Accurate brain tumor diagnosis requires models to not only detect lesions but also generate clinically interpretable reasoning grounded in imaging manifestations, yet existing public datasets remain limited in annotation richness and diagnostic semantics. To bridge this gap, we introduce MM-NeuroOnco, a large-scale multimodal benchmark and instruction-tuning dataset for brain tumor MRI understanding, consisting of 24,726 MRI slices from 20 data sources paired with approximately 200,000 semantically enriched multimodal instructions spanning diverse tumor subtypes and imaging modalities. To mitigate the scarcity and high cost of diagnostic semantic annotations, we develop a multi-model collaborative pipeline for automated medical information completion and quality control, enabling the generation of diagnosis-related semantics beyond mask-only annotations. Building upon this dataset, we further construct MM-NeuroOnco-Bench, a manually annotated evaluation benchmark with a rejection-aware setting to reduce biases inherent in closed-ended question formats. Evaluation across ten representative models shows that even the strongest baseline, Gemini 3 Flash, achieves only 41.88% accuracy on diagnosis-related questions, highlighting the substantial challenges of multimodal brain tumor diagnostic understanding. Leveraging MM-NeuroOnco, we further propose NeuroOnco-GPT, which achieves a 27% absolute accuracy improvement on diagnostic questions following fine-tuning. This result demonstrates the effectiveness of our dataset and benchmark in advancing clinically grounded multimodal diagnostic reasoning.

Current agentic benchmarks assume domain-specific integration, encoding task information in ways that preclude fair evaluation of general agents. This paper frames general-agent evaluation as a first-class research objective. We propose conceptual principles for such evaluation, a Unified Protocol enabling agent-benchmark integration, and Exgentic - a practical framework for general agent evaluation. We benchmark five prominent agent implementations across six environments as the first Open General Agent Leaderboard. Our experiments show that general agents generalize across diverse environments, achieving performance comparable to domain-specific agents without any environment-specific tuning.

    "abstract": "Percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (PDT) is frequently performed on patients in intensive care units for prolonged mechanical ventilation. The needle puncture, as the most critical step of PDT, could lead to adverse consequences such as major bleeding and posterior tracheal wall perforation if performed inaccurately. Current practices of PDT puncture are all performed manually with no navigation assistance, which leads to large position and angular errors (5 mm and 30 degree). To improve the accuracy and reduce the difficulty of the PDT procedure, we propose a system that automates the needle insertion using a velocity-controlled robotic manipulator. Guided using pose data from two electromagnetic sensors, one at the needle tip and the other inside the trachea, the robotic system uses an adaptive constrained controller to adapt the uncertain kinematic parameters online and avoid collisions with the patient's body and tissues near the target. Simulations were performed to validate the controller's implementation, and then four hundred PDT punctures were performed on a mannequin to evaluate the position and angular accuracy. The absolute median puncture position error was 1.7 mm (IQR: 1.9 mm) and midline deviation was 4.13 degree (IQR: 4.55 degree), measured by the sensor inside the trachea. The small deviations from the nominal puncture in a simulated experimental setup and formal guarantees of collision-free insertions suggest the feasibility of the robotic PDT puncture.",

    "abstract": "Fingerspelling is a component of sign languages in which words are spelled out letter by letter using specific hand poses. Automatic fingerspelling recognition plays a crucial role in bridging the communication gap between Deaf and hearing communities, yet it remains challenging due to the signing-hand ambiguity issue, the lack of appropriate training losses, and the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) problem. Prior fingerspelling recognition methods rely on explicit signing-hand detection, which often leads to recognition failures, and on a connectionist temporal classification (CTC) loss, which exhibits the peaky behavior problem. To address these issues, we develop OpenFS, an open-source approach for fingerspelling recognition and synthesis. We propose a multi-hand-capable fingerspelling recognizer that supports both single- and multi-hand inputs and performs implicit signing-hand detection by incorporating a dual-level positional encoding and a signing-hand focus (SF) loss. The SF loss encourages cross-attention to focus on the signing hand, enabling implicit signing-hand detection during recognition. Furthermore, without relying on the CTC loss, we introduce a monotonic alignment (MA) loss that enforces the output letter sequence to follow the temporal order of the input pose sequence through cross-attention regularization. In addition, we propose a frame-wise letter-conditioned generator that synthesizes realistic fingerspelling pose sequences for OOV words. This generator enables the construction of a new synthetic benchmark, called FSNeo. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in recognition and validate the effectiveness of the proposed recognizer and generator.

    "abstract": "Visual Autoregressive(VAR) models enhance generation quality but face a critical efficiency bottleneck in later stages. In this paper, we present a novel optimization framework for VAR models that fundamentally differs from prior approaches such as FastVAR and SkipVAR. Instead of relying on heuristic skipping strategies, our method leverages attention entropy to characterize the semantic projections across different dimensions of the model architecture. This enables precise identification of parameter dynamics under varying token granularity levels, semantic scopes, and generation scales. Building on this analysis, we further uncover sparsity patterns along three critical dimensions-token, layer, and scale-and propose a set of fine-grained optimization strategies tailored to these patterns. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that our approach achieves aggressive acceleration of the generation process while significantly preserving semantic fidelity and fine details, outperforming traditional methods in both efficiency and quality. Experiments on Infinity-2B and Infinity-8B models demonstrate that ToProVAR achieves up to 3.4x acceleration with minimal quality loss, effectively mitigating the issues found in prior work.

This paper presents an extended framework for reconstructing performance metrics from panned and zoomed video recordings across all sprint disciplines (K1-K4, C1-C2) and distances (200m-500m). Our method utilizes YOLOv8 for buoy and athlete detection, leveraging the known buoy grid to estimate homographies. We generalized the estimation of the boat position by means of learning a boat-specific athlete offset using a U-net based boat tip calibration. Further, we implement a robust tracking scheme using optical flow to adapt to multi-athlete boat types. Finally, we introduce methods to extract stroke rate information from either pose estimations or the athlete bounding boxes themselves. Evaluation against GPS data from elite competitions yields a velocity RRMSE of 0.020 +- 0.011 (rho = 0.956) and a stroke rate RRMSE of 0.022 +- 0.024 (rho = 0.932).

    "title": "Considering Perspectives for Automated Driving Ethics: Collective Risk in Vehicular Motion Planning",
    "abstract": "Recent automated vehicle (AV) motion planning strategies evolve around minimizing risk in road traffic. However, they exclusively consider risk from the AV's perspective and, as such, do not address the ethicality of its decisions for other road users. We argue that this does not reduce the risk of each road user, as risk may be different from the perspective of each road user. Indeed, minimizing the risk from the AV's perspective may not imply that the risk from the perspective of other road users is also being minimized; in fact, it may even increase. To test this hypothesis, we propose an AV motion planning strategy that supports switching risk minimization strategies between all road user perspectives. We find that the risk from the perspective of other road users can generally be considered different to the risk from the AV's perspective. Taking a collective risk perspective, i.e., balancing the risks of all road users, we observe an AV that minimizes overall traffic risk the best, while putting itself at slightly higher risk for the benefit of others, which is consistent with human driving behavior. In addition, adopting a collective risk minimization strategy can also be beneficial to the AV's travel efficiency by acting assertively when other road users maintain a low risk estimate of the AV. Yet, the AV drives conservatively when its planned actions are less predictable to other road users, i.e., associated with high risk. We argue that such behavior is a form of self-reflection and a natural prerequisite for socially acceptable AV behavior. We conclude that to facilitate ethicality in road traffic that includes AVs, the risk-perspective of each road user must be considered in the decision-making of AVs.",

    "abstract": "Parameter-efficient fine-tuning has demonstrated promising results across various visual adaptation tasks, such as classification and segmentation. Typically, prompt tuning techniques have harnessed knowledge from a single pre-trained model, whether from a general or a specialized medical domain. However, this approach typically overlooks the potential synergies that could arise from integrating diverse domain knowledge within the same tuning process. In this work, we propose a novel Mixture-of-Experts prompt tuning method called pMoE, which leverages the strengths of multiple expert domains through expert-specialized prompt tokens and the learnable dispatcher, effectively combining their expertise in a unified model framework. Our pMoE introduces expert-specific prompt tokens and utilizes a dynamic token dispatching mechanism at various prompt layers to optimize the contribution of each domain expert during the adaptation phase. By incorporating both domain knowledge from diverse experts, the proposed pMoE significantly enhances the model's versatility and applicability to a broad spectrum of tasks. We conduct extensive experiments across 47 adaptation tasks, including both classification and segmentation in general and medical domains. The results demonstrate that our pMoE not only achieves superior performance with a large margin of improvements but also offers an optimal trade-off between computational efficiency and adaptation effectiveness compared to existing methods.",

Building on classical results in Riemannian optimization and Sobolev theory on manifolds, we derive geometry dependent constants that yield (i) a Descent Lemma with a manifold Sobolev smoothness constant, (ii) a Sobolev Polyak Lojasiewicz inequality giving linear convergence guarantees for Riemannian gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent under explicit step size bounds, and (iii) a two step Newton Sobolev method with local quadratic contraction in curvature controlled neighborhoods.   Unlike prior Sobolev training in Euclidean space, MSINO provides training time guarantees that explicitly track curvature and transported Jacobians.

    "abstract": "Algorithmic stability is among the most potent techniques in generalization analysis. However, its derivation usually requires a stepsize $η_t = \\mathcal{O}(1/t)$ under non-convex training regimes, where $t$ denotes iterations. This rigid decay of the stepsize potentially impedes optimization and may not align with practical scenarios. In this paper, we derive the generalization bounds under the homogeneous neural network regimes, proving that this regime enables slower stepsize decay of order $Ω(1/\\sqrt{t})$ under mild assumptions. We further extend the theoretical results from several aspects, e.g., non-Lipschitz regimes. This finding is broadly applicable, as homogeneous neural networks encompass fully-connected and convolutional neural networks with ReLU and LeakyReLU activations.",

    "abstract": "Despite being one of the most widely spoken languages globally, Bangla remains a low-resource language in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Mainstream Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Speaker Diarization systems for Bangla struggles when processing longform audio exceeding 3060 seconds. This paper presents a robust framework specifically engineered for extended Bangla content by leveraging preexisting models enhanced with novel optimization pipelines for the DL Sprint 4.0 contest. Our approach utilizes Voice Activity Detection (VAD) optimization and Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) segmentation via forced word alignment to maintain temporal accuracy and transcription integrity over long durations. Additionally, we employed several finetuning techniques and preprocessed the data using augmentation techniques and noise removal. By bridging the performance gap in complex, multi-speaker environments, this work provides a scalable solution for real-world, longform Bangla speech applications.",

Building on the probabilistic model of semantic communication and leveraging the concept of context, this paper examines a specific subclass of semantic communication problems, where semantic noise originates solely from the semantic channel, assuming an ideal physical channel. To model this system, we introduce a virtual state-dependent channel, where the state-representing context-plays a crucial role in shaping communication. We further analyze the representational capability of the semantic encoder and explore various semantic communication scenarios in the presence of semantic noise, deriving capacity results for some cases and achievable rates for others.",

    "abstract": "Efficiently understanding long-form videos remains a fundamental challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). In this paper, we present MLLM-Sampler Joint Evolution (MSJoE), a novel framework that jointly evolves the MLLM and a lightweight key-frame sampler for efficient long-form video understanding. MSJoE builds upon a key assumption that only a small subset of key-frames is truly informative for answering each question to a video. Specifically, MSJoE first reasons out several queries, which describe diverse visual perspectives relevant to the question. Then, these queries interact with a frozen CLIP model to produce a query-frame similarity matrix. Finally, a lightweight sampler predicts key-frame sampling weights from this matrix, selecting a compact set of informative frames, which are then fed into the MLLM for answer generation. Both the MLLM and sampler are jointly optimized through reinforcement learning, enabling co-adaptation of query-reasoning, frame-sampling, and key-frame understanding. A new long-video QA dataset containing 2.8K videos with 7K question-answer pairs is collected to support the training process. Extensive experiments on VideoMME, LongVideoBench, LVBench, and MLVU show that MSJoE achieves 8.0\\% accuracy gain upon the base MLLM, and 1.1\\% higher accuracy than strongest baseline method.",

In the high-stakes domain of maritime navigation, the ability to bridge the gap between raw visual perception and complex cognitive reasoning is not merely an enhancement but a critical prerequisite for Autonomous Surface Vessels to execute safe and precise maneuvers. To this end, we present WaterVideoQA, the first large-scale, comprehensive Video Question Answering benchmark specifically engineered for all-waterway environments. This benchmark encompasses 3,029 video clips across six distinct waterway categories, integrating multifaceted variables such as volatile lighting and dynamic weather to rigorously stress-test ASV capabilities across a five-tier hierarchical cognitive framework. Furthermore, we introduce NaviMind, a pioneering multi-agent neuro-symbolic system designed for open-ended maritime reasoning. By synergizing Adaptive Semantic Routing, Situation-Aware Hierarchical Reasoning, and Autonomous Self-Reflective Verification, NaviMind transitions ASVs from superficial pattern matching to regulation-compliant, interpretable decision-making. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly transcends existing baselines, establishing a new paradigm for intelligent, trustworthy interaction in dynamic maritime environments.",

    "abstract": "Although deep learning has significantly advanced the perception capabilities of intelligent transportation systems, railway applications continue to suffer from a scarcity of high-quality, annotated data for safety-critical tasks like obstacle detection. While photorealistic simulators offer a solution, they often struggle with the ``sim-to-real\" gap; conversely, simple image-masking techniques lack the spatio-temporal coherence required to obtain augmented single- and multi-frame scenes with the correct appearance and dimensions. This paper introduces a multi-modal augmented reality framework designed to bridge this gap by integrating photorealistic virtual objects into real-world railway sequences from the OSDaR23 dataset. Utilizing Unreal Engine 5 features, our pipeline leverages LiDAR point-clouds and INS/GNSS data to ensure accurate object placement and temporal stability across RGB frames. This paper also proposes a segmentation-based refinement strategy for INS/GNSS data to significantly improve the realism of the augmented sequences, as confirmed by the comparative study presented in the paper. Carefully designed augmented sequences are collected to produce OSDaR-AR, a public dataset designed to support the development of next-generation railway perception systems.

However, existing CDT frameworks remain limited to task-specific predictors rather than building a patient-specific, manipulable virtual heart. In this work, we introduce Chain of Flow (COF), a foundational ECG-driven generative framework that reconstructs full 4D cardiac structure and motion from a single cardiac cycle. The method integrates cine-CMR and 12-lead ECG during training to learn a unified representation of cardiac geometry, electrophysiology, and motion dynamics. We evaluate Chain of Flow on diverse cohorts and demonstrate accurate recovery of cardiac anatomy, chamber-wise function, and dynamic motion patterns. The reconstructed 4D hearts further support downstream CDT tasks such as volumetry, regional function analysis, and virtual cine synthesis. By enabling full 4D organ reconstruction directly from ECG, COF transforms cardiac digital twins from narrow predictive models into fully generative, patient-specific virtual hearts. Code will be released after review.",

    "abstract": "Vision-language models (VLMs) can read text from images, but where does this optical character recognition (OCR) information enter the language processing stream? We investigate the OCR routing mechanism across three architecture families (Qwen3-VL, Phi-4, InternVL3.5) using causal interventions. By computing activation differences between original images and text-inpainted versions, we identify architecture-specific OCR bottlenecks whose dominant location depends on the vision-language integration strategy: DeepStack models (Qwen) show peak sensitivity at mid-depth (about 50%) for scene text, while single-stage projection models (Phi-4, InternVL) peak at early layers (6-25%), though the exact layer of maximum effect varies across datasets. The OCR signal is remarkably low-dimensional: PC1 captures 72.9% of variance. Crucially, principal component analysis (PCA) directions learned on one dataset transfer to others, demonstrating shared text-processing pathways. Surprisingly, in models with modular OCR circuits (notably Qwen3-VL-4B), OCR removal can improve counting performance (up to +6.9 percentage points), suggesting OCR interferes with other visual processing in sufficiently modular architectures.",

To this end, we introduce and study a new problem, Semi-Supervised Multimodal Domain Generalization (SSMDG), which aims to learn robust multimodal models from multi-source data with few labeled samples. We observe that existing approaches fail to address this setting effectively: multimodal domain generalization methods cannot exploit unlabeled data, semi-supervised multimodal learning methods ignore domain shifts, and semi-supervised domain generalization methods are confined to single-modality inputs. To overcome these limitations, we propose a unified framework featuring three key components: Consensus-Driven Consistency Regularization, which obtains reliable pseudo-labels through confident fused-unimodal consensus; Disagreement-Aware Regularization, which effectively utilizes ambiguous non-consensus samples; and Cross-Modal Prototype Alignment, which enforces domain- and modality-invariant representations while promoting robustness under missing modalities via cross-modal translation. We further establish the first SSMDG benchmarks, on which our method consistently outperforms strong baselines in both standard and missing-modality scenarios.

    "title": "A Simple Distributed Deterministic Planar Separator",
    "abstract": "A balanced separator of a graph $G$ is a set of vertices whose removal disconnects the graph into connected components that are a constant factor smaller than $G$. Lipton and Tarjan [FOCS'77] famously proved that every planar graph admits a balanced separator of size $O(\\sqrt{n})$, as well as a balanced separator of size $O(D)$ that is a simple path (where $D$ is $G$'s diameter). In the centralized setting, both separators can be found in linear time. In the distributed setting, $D$ is a universal lower bound for the round complexity of solving many optimization problems, so, separators of size $O(D)$ are preferable.   It was not until [DISC'17] that a distributed algorithm was devised by Ghaffari and Parter to compute such an $O(D)$-size separator in $\\tilde O(D)$ rounds, by adapting the Lipton-Tarjan algorithm to the distributed model. Since then, this algorithm was used in several distributed algorithms for planar graphs, e.g., [GP, DISC'17], [LP, STOC'19], [AEDPW, PODC'25]. However, the algorithm is randomized, deeming the algorithms that use it to be randomized as well. Obtaining a deterministic algorithm remained an interesting open question until [PODC'25], when a (complex) deterministic separator algorithm was given by Jauregui, Montealegre and Rapaport.   We present a much simpler deterministic separator algorithm with the same (near-optimal) $\\tilde O(D)$-round complexity. While previous works devised either complicated or randomized ways of transferring weights from vertices to faces of $G$, we show that a straightforward way also works: Each vertex simply transfers its weight to one arbitrary face it lies on. That's it!   We note that a deterministic separator algorithm directly derandomizes the state-of-the-art distributed algorithms for classical problems on planar graphs such as single-source shortest-paths, maximum-flow, directed global min-cut, and reachability.",

Agents play the smallest-equilibrium of the induced Bayesian game, reflecting conservative, coordination-averse behavior typical in distributed systems. We show that when utilities admit a convex potential and welfare is convex, the robustly implementable optimum has a remarkably simple form: perfect coordination at each state: either everyone acts or no one does. We provide a constructive threshold rule: compute a one-dimensional score for each state, sort states, and pick a single threshold (with a knife-edge lottery for at most one state). This rule is an explicit optimal vertex of a linear program (LP) characterized by feasibility and sequential obedience constraints. Empirically, in both vaccination and technology-adoption domains, our constructive policy matches LP optima, scales as $O(|Θ|\\log|Θ|)$, and avoids the inflated welfare predicted by obedience-only designs that assume the designer can dictate the (best) equilibrium. The result is a general, scalable recipe for robust coordination in MAS with complementarities.",

On the SlimOrca benchmark, NoRA breaks this linear barrier: NoRA remarkably at rank 64 (PPL 3.89) outperforms LoRA at rank 512 (PPL 3.90), demonstrating superior spectral efficiency. This advantage generalizes to mathematical reasoning, where NoRA achieves a perplexity of 1.97 on MathInstruct, significantly surpassing LoRA's saturation point of 2.07. Mechanism analysis via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) confirms that NoRA activates the dormant tail of the singular value spectrum, effectively preventing the rank collapse observed in linear methods.",

    "title": "PSQE: A Theoretical-Practical Approach to Pseudo Seed Quality Enhancement for Unsupervised MMEA",
    "abstract": "Multimodal Entity Alignment (MMEA) aims to identify equivalent entities across different data modalities, enabling structural data integration that in turn improves the performance of various large language model applications. To lift the requirement of labeled seed pairs that are difficult to obtain, recent methods shifted to an unsupervised paradigm using pseudo-alignment seeds. However, unsupervised entity alignment in multimodal settings remains underexplored, mainly because the incorporation of multimodal information often results in imbalanced coverage of pseudo-seeds within the knowledge graph. To overcome this, we propose PSQE (Pseudo-Seed Quality Enhancement) to improve the precision and graph coverage balance of pseudo seeds via multimodal information and clustering-resampling. Theoretical analysis reveals the impact of pseudo seeds on existing contrastive learning-based MMEA models. In particular, pseudo seeds can influence the attraction and the repulsion terms in contrastive learning at once, whereas imbalanced graph coverage causes models to prioritize high-density regions, thereby weakening their learning capability for entities in sparse regions. Experimental results validate our theoretical findings and show that PSQE as a plug-and-play module can improve the performance of baselines by considerable margins.",

    "title": "A Data-Driven Approach to Support Clinical Renal Replacement Therapy",
    "abstract": "This study investigates a data-driven machine learning approach to predict membrane fouling in critically ill patients undergoing Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT). Using time-series data from an ICU, 16 clinically selected features were identified to train predictive models. To ensure interpretability and enable reliable counterfactual analysis, the researchers adopted a tabular data approach rather than modeling temporal dependencies directly. Given the imbalance between fouling and non-fouling cases, the ADASYN oversampling technique was applied to improve minority class representation. Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM models were tested, achieving balanced performance with 77.6% sensitivity and 96.3% specificity at a 10% rebalancing rate. Results remained robust across different forecasting horizons. Notably, the tabular approach outperformed LSTM recurrent neural networks, suggesting that explicit temporal modeling was not necessary for strong predictive performance. Feature selection further reduced the model to five key variables, improving simplicity and interpretability with minimal loss of accuracy. A Shapley value-based counterfactual analysis was applied to the best-performing model, successfully identifying minimal input changes capable of reversing fouling predictions. Overall, the findings support the viability of interpretable machine learning models for predicting membrane fouling during CRRT. The integration of prediction and counterfactual analysis offers practical clinical value, potentially guiding therapeutic adjustments to reduce fouling risk and improve patient management.",

    "abstract": "Storytelling infographics are a powerful medium for communicating data-driven stories through visual presentation. However, existing authoring tools lack support for maintaining story consistency and aligning with users' story goals throughout the design process. To address this gap, we conducted formative interviews and a quantitative analysis to identify design needs and common story-informed layout patterns in infographics. Based on these insights, we propose a narrative-centric workflow for infographic creation consisting of three phases: story construction, visual encoding, and spatial composition. Building on this workflow, we developed InfoAlign, a human-AI co-creation system that transforms long or unstructured text into stories, recommends semantically aligned visual designs, and generates layout blueprints. Users can intervene and refine the design at any stage, ensuring their intent is preserved and the infographic creation process remains transparent. Evaluations show that InfoAlign preserves story coherence across authoring stages and effectively supports human-AI co-creation for storytelling infographic design.",

    "abstract": "Human intelligence naturally intertwines omni-modal perception -- spanning vision, audio, and language -- with complex reasoning and tool usage to interact with the world. However, current multi-modal LLMs are primarily confined to bi-modal interactions (e.g., vision-language), lacking the unified cognitive capabilities required for general AI assistants. To bridge this gap, we introduce OmniGAIA, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate omni-modal agents on tasks necessitating deep reasoning and multi-turn tool execution across video, audio, and image modalities. Constructed via a novel omni-modal event graph approach, OmniGAIA synthesizes complex, multi-hop queries derived from real-world data that require cross-modal reasoning and external tool integration. Furthermore, we propose OmniAtlas, a native omni-modal foundation agent under tool-integrated reasoning paradigm with active omni-modal perception. Trained on trajectories synthesized via a hindsight-guided tree exploration strategy and OmniDPO for fine-grained error correction, OmniAtlas effectively enhances the tool-use capabilities of existing open-source models. This work marks a step towards next-generation native omni-modal AI assistants for real-world scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown remarkable success in robotic tasks like manipulation by fusing a language model's reasoning with a vision model's 3D understanding. However, their high computational cost remains a major obstacle for real-world applications that require real-time performance. We observe that the actions within a task have varying levels of importance: critical steps demand high precision, while less important ones can tolerate more variance. Leveraging this insight, we propose DySL-VLA, a novel framework that addresses computational cost by dynamically skipping VLA layers based on each action's importance. DySL-VLA categorizes its layers into two types: informative layers, which are consistently executed, and incremental layers, which can be selectively skipped. To intelligently skip layers without sacrificing accuracy, we invent a prior-post skipping guidance mechanism to determine when to initiate layer-skipping. We also propose a skip-aware two-stage knowledge distillation algorithm to efficiently train a standard VLA into a DySL-VLA. Our experiments indicate that DySL-VLA achieves 2.1% improvement in success length over Deer-VLA on the Calvin dataset, while simultaneously reducing trainable parameters by a factor of 85.7 and providing a 3.75x speedup relative to the RoboFlamingo baseline at iso-accuracy.

    "abstract": "Taxation constitutes a fundamental component of modern national economic systems, exerting profound impacts on both societal functioning and governmental operations. In this paper, we employ an interdependent network approach to model the coevolution between citizens and regulators within a taxation system that fundamentally constitutes a public goods game framework with complex interactive dynamics. In a game layer, citizens engage in public goods games, facing the social dilemma of tax compliance (cooperation) versus evasion (defection). Tax compliance supports the sustainability of public finances while tax evasion presents markedly stronger short-term incentives. In a regulatory layer, fair regulators punish tax evaders, while corrupt regulators keep silent due to bribes. Governmental regulatory interventions introduce critical institutional constraints that alter the traditional equilibrium of the game. Importantly, there exists a strategy update not only among citizens but also among regulators. Our results indicate that strengthening penalties can effectively curb tax evasion, and the influence of bribery on both tax compliance rates and the proportion of fair regulators is nonlinear. Additionally, increasing regulators' salaries and intensifying the crackdown on corrupt regulators can foster the emergence of fair regulators, thereby reducing tax evasion among citizens. The results offer practical policy implications, suggesting that balanced deterrence and institutional fairness are essential to sustaining compliance, and point to the need for future empirical validation and model extensions.",

To bridge this gap, we conducted 21 semi-structured interviews with local journalists in Germany. Our study investigates how local journalists use data and AI (RQ1); the challenges they encounter when interacting with data and AI (RQ2); and the self-perceived opportunities of AI-supported reporting systems through the lens of discursive design (RQ3). Our findings reveal that local journalists do not fully leverage AI's potential to support data-related work. Despite local journalists' limited awareness of AI's capabilities, they are willing to use it to process data and discover stories. Finally, we provide recommendations for improving AI-supported reporting in the context of local news, grounded in the journalists' socio-technical perspective and their imagined AI future capabilities.",

While self-consistency (SC) training on unlabeled empirical data can enhance network robustness, current approaches are limited to static, single-task settings and fail to handle sequentially arriving data or distribution shifts. We propose a continual learning framework for ABI that decouples simulation-based pre-training from unsupervised sequential SC fine-tuning on real-world data. To address the challenge of catastrophic forgetting, we introduce two adaptation strategies: (1) SC with episodic replay, utilizing a memory buffer of past observations, and (2) SC with elastic weight consolidation, which regularizes updates to preserve task-critical parameters. Across three diverse case studies, our methods significantly mitigate forgetting and yield posterior estimates that outperform standard simulation-based training, achieving estimates closer to MCMC reference, providing a viable path for trustworthy ABI across a range of different tasks.",

While SHAP explanations are routinely computed independently for each output coordinate, the theoretical necessity of this practice has remained unclear. By extending the classical Shapley axioms to vector-valued cooperative games, we establish a rigidity theorem showing that any attribution rule satisfying efficiency, symmetry, dummy player, and additivity must necessarily decompose component-wise across outputs. Consequently, any joint-output attribution rule must relax at least one of the classical Shapley axioms. This result identifies a previously unformalized structural constraint in Shapley-based interpretability, clarifying the precise scope of fairness-consistent explanations in multi-output learning. Numerical experiments on a biomedical benchmark illustrate that multi-output models can yield computational savings in training and deployment, while producing SHAP explanations that remain fully consistent with the component-wise structure imposed by the Shapley axioms.",

Therefore, this paper proposes a Large Language Model Hyperbolic Aligned Knowledge Tracing(L-HAKT). First, the teacher agent deeply parses question semantics and explicitly constructs hierarchical dependencies of knowledge points; the student agent simulates learning behaviors to generate synthetic data. Then, contrastive learning is performed between synthetic and real data in hyperbolic space to reduce distribution differences in key features such as question difficulty and forgetting patterns. Finally, by optimizing hyperbolic curvature, we explicitly model the tree-like hierarchical structure of knowledge points, precisely characterizing differences in learning curve morphology for knowledge points at different levels. Extensive experiments on four real-world educational datasets validate the effectiveness of our Large Language Model Hyperbolic Aligned Knowledge Tracing (L-HAKT) framework.",

The complexity of determining the minimum number of flips that transform one triangulation of a convex point set into another remained a tantalizing open question for many decades. We settle this question by proving that computing shortest flip sequences between triangulations of convex polygons, and therefore also computing the rotation distance of binary trees, is NP-hard.   For our proof we develop techniques for flip sequences of triangulations whose counterparts were introduced for the study of flip sequences of non-crossing spanning trees by Bjerkevik, Kleist, Ueckerdt, and Vogtenhuber~[SODA25] and Bjerkevik, Dorfer, Kleist, Ueckerdt, and Vogtenhuber~[SoCG26].",

Rather than viewing autoencoders as producing a single global Euclidean embedding, we treat a collection of locally trained encoder-decoder pairs as a learned atlas on a manifold. We show that any reconstruction-consistent autoencoder atlas canonically defines transition maps satisfying the cocycle condition, and that linearising these transition maps yields a vector bundle coinciding with the tangent bundle when the latent dimension matches the intrinsic dimension of the manifold. This construction provides direct access to differential-topological invariants of the data. In particular, we show that the first Stiefel-Whitney class can be computed from the signs of the Jacobians of learned transition maps, yielding an algorithmic criterion for detecting orientability. We also show that non-trivial characteristic classes provide obstructions to single-chart representations, and that the minimum number of autoencoder charts is determined by the good cover structure of the manifold. Finally, we apply our methodology to low-dimensional orientable and non-orientable manifolds, as well as to a non-orientable high-dimensional image dataset.",

    "abstract": "Reasoning with large language models often benefits from generating multiple chains-of-thought, but existing aggregation strategies are typically trajectory-level (e.g., selecting the best trace or voting on the final answer), discarding useful intermediate work from partial or \"nearly correct\" attempts. We propose Stitching Noisy Diffusion Thoughts, a self-consistency framework that turns cheap diffusion-sampled reasoning into a reusable pool of step-level candidates. Given a problem, we (i) sample many diverse, low-cost reasoning trajectories using a masked diffusion language model, (ii) score every intermediate step with an off-the-shelf process reward model (PRM), and (iii) stitch these highest-quality steps across trajectories into a composite rationale. This rationale then conditions an autoregressive (AR) model (solver) to recompute only the final answer. This modular pipeline separates exploration (diffusion) from evaluation and solution synthesis, avoiding monolithic unified hybrids while preserving broad search. Across math reasoning benchmarks, we find that step-level recombination is most beneficial on harder problems, and ablations highlight the importance of the final AR solver in converting stitched but imperfect rationales into accurate answers. Using low-confidence diffusion sampling with parallel, independent rollouts, our training-free framework improves average accuracy by up to 23.8% across six math and coding tasks. At the same time, it achieves up to a 1.8x latency reduction relative to both traditional diffusion models (e.g., Dream, LLaDA) and unified architectures (e.g., TiDAR).

Standard dynamic programming evaluates the minimum number of tests in the worst case in $\\mathcal{O}(K \\cdot N^2)$ time.

In this paper, we demonstrate that the discrete binary search over the decision tree can be bypassed entirely. By utilizing a relaxation of the binomial bounds, we compute an approximate root that tightly bounds the optimal value. We mathematically prove that this approximation restricts the remaining search space to exactly $\\mathcal{O}(K)$ discrete steps. Because constraints inherently enforce $K < \\log_2(N+1)$, our algorithm achieves an unconditional worst-case time complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(\\min(K, \\log N))$.

    "abstract": "Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) promise fast non-autoregressive inference but suffer a severe quality-speed trade-off in parallel decoding. This stems from the ''combinatorial contradiction'' phenomenon, where parallel tokens form semantically inconsistent combinations. We address this by integrating continuous representations into the discrete decoding process, as they preserve rich inter-position dependency. We propose ReMix (Rejection Mixing), a framework that introduces a novel Continuous Mixing State as an intermediate between the initial masked state and the final decoded token state. This intermediate state allows a token's representation to be iteratively refined in a continuous space, resolving mutual conflicts with other tokens before collapsing into a final discrete sample. Furthermore, a rejection rule reverts uncertain representations from the continuous state back to the masked state for reprocessing, ensuring stability and preventing error propagation. ReMix thus mitigates combinatorial contradictions by enabling continuous-space refinement during discrete diffusion decoding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReMix, as a training-free method, achieves a $2-8 \\times$ inference speedup without any quality degradation.",

    "title": "SO3UFormer: Learning Intrinsic Spherical Features for Rotation-Robust Panoramic Segmentation",
    "abstract": "Panoramic semantic segmentation models are typically trained under a strict gravity-aligned assumption. However, real-world captures often deviate from this canonical orientation due to unconstrained camera motions, such as the rotational jitter of handheld devices or the dynamic attitude shifts of aerial platforms. This discrepancy causes standard spherical Transformers to overfit global latitude cues, leading to performance collapse under 3D reorientations. To address this, we introduce SO3UFormer, a rotation-robust architecture designed to learn intrinsic spherical features that are less sensitive to the underlying coordinate frame. Our approach rests on three geometric pillars: (1) an intrinsic feature formulation that decouples the representation from the gravity vector by removing absolute latitude encoding; (2) quadrature-consistent spherical attention that accounts for non-uniform sampling densities; and (3) a gauge-aware relative positional mechanism that encodes local angular geometry using tangent-plane projected angles and discrete gauge pooling, avoiding reliance on global axes. We further use index-based spherical resampling together with a logit-level SO(3)-consistency regularizer during training. To rigorously benchmark robustness, we introduce Pose35, a dataset variant of Stanford2D3D perturbed by random rotations within $\\pm 35^\\circ$. Under the extreme test of arbitrary full SO(3) rotations, existing SOTAs fail catastrophically: the baseline SphereUFormer drops from 67.53 mIoU to 25.26 mIoU. In contrast, SO3UFormer demonstrates remarkable stability, achieving 72.03 mIoU on Pose35 and retaining 70.67 mIoU under full SO(3) rotations.",

    "abstract": "Explicit representations of predicate-argument relations form the basis of interpretable semantic analysis, supporting reasoning, generation, and evaluation. However, attaining such semantic structures requires costly annotation efforts and has remained largely confined to English. We leverage the Question-Answer driven Semantic Role Labeling (QA-SRL) framework -- a natural-language formulation of predicate-argument relations -- as the foundation for extending semantic annotation to new languages. To this end, we introduce a cross-linguistic projection approach that reuses an English QA-SRL parser within a constrained translation and word-alignment pipeline to automatically generate question-answer annotations aligned with target-language predicates. Applied to Hebrew, Russian, and French -- spanning diverse language families -- the method yields high-quality training data and fine-tuned, language-specific parsers that outperform strong multilingual LLM baselines (GPT-4o, LLaMA-Maverick). By leveraging QA-SRL as a transferable natural-language interface for semantics, our approach enables efficient and broadly accessible predicate-argument parsing across languages.",

    "abstract": "This paper focuses on enhancing the grasping precision and generalization of manipulation policies learned via imitation learning. Diffusion-based policy learning methods have recently become the mainstream approach for robotic manipulation tasks. As grasping is a critical subtask in manipulation, the ability of imitation-learned policies to execute precise and generalizable grasps merits particular attention. Existing imitation learning techniques for grasping often suffer from imprecise grasp executions, limited spatial generalization, and poor object generalization. To address these challenges, we incorporate grasp prior knowledge into the diffusion policy framework. In particular, we employ a latent diffusion policy to guide action chunk decoding with grasp pose prior, ensuring that generated motion trajectories adhere closely to feasible grasp configurations. Furthermore, we introduce a self-supervised reconstruction objective during diffusion to embed the graspness prior: at each reverse diffusion step, we reconstruct wrist-camera images back-projected the graspness from the intermediate representations. Both simulation and real robot experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms baseline methods and exhibits strong dynamic grasping capabilities.",

    "abstract": "As Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) scale up and reinforcement learning (RL) methods mature, LMMs have made notable progress in complex reasoning and decision making. Yet training still relies on static data and fixed recipes, making it difficult to diagnose capability blind spots or provide dynamic, targeted reinforcement. Motivated by findings that test driven error exposure and feedback based correction outperform repetitive practice, we propose Diagnostic-driven Progressive Evolution (DPE), a spiral loop where diagnosis steers data generation and reinforcement, and each iteration re-diagnoses the updated model to drive the next round of targeted improvement. DPE has two key components. First, multiple agents annotate and quality control massive unlabeled multimodal data, using tools such as web search and image editing to produce diverse, realistic samples. Second, DPE attributes failures to specific weaknesses, dynamically adjusts the data mixture, and guides agents to generate weakness focused data for targeted reinforcement. Experiments on Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct show stable, continual gains across eleven benchmarks, indicating DPE as a scalable paradigm for continual LMM training under open task distributions.

We investigate how the $F$-isolation number $ι(G,F)$ of a graph $G$ is affected by the minimum degree $d$ of $G$, establishing a bounded range, in terms of $d$ and the orders of $F$ and $G$, for the largest possible value of $ι(G,F)$ with $d$ sufficiently large.

To address this gap, this work investigates the shape reconstruction abilities of a third-order strain interpolation method, examining its ability to capture both individual and combined deformation effects. These results are compared and discussed against the Geometric-Variable Strain approach. Subsequently, simulation results are experimentally verified by reshaping a slender rod while recording the resulting configurations using cameras. The rod configuration is imposed using a manipulator displacing one of its tips and extracted through reflective markers, without the aid of any other external sensor -- i.e. strain gauges or wrench sensors placed along the rod. The experiments demonstrate good agreement between the model predictions and observed shapes, with average error of 0.58% of the rod length and average computational time of 0.32s per configuration, outperforming existing models.",

    "abstract": "Modern multi-tenant, hardware-heterogeneous computing environments pose significant challenges for effective workload orchestration. Simple heuristics for assessing workload performance, such as CPU utilization or application-level metrics, are often insufficient to capture the complex performance dynamics arising from resource contention and noisy-neighbor effects. In such environments, performance bottlenecks may emerge in any shared system resource, leading to unexpected and difficult-to-diagnose degradation.   This paper introduces buoyancy, a novel abstraction for characterizing workload performance in multi-tenant systems. Unlike traditional approaches, buoyancy integrates application-level metrics with system-level insights of shared resource contention to provide a holistic view of performance dynamics. By explicitly capturing bottlenecks and headroom across multiple resources, buoyancy facilitates resource-aware and application-aware orchestration in a manner that is intuitive, extensible, and generalizable across heterogeneous platforms. We evaluate buoyancy using representative multi-tenant workloads to illustrate its ability to expose performance-limiting resource interactions. Buoyancy provides a 19.3% better indication of bottlenecks compared to traditional heuristics on average. We additionally show how buoyancy can act as a drop-in replacement for conventional performance metrics, enabling improved observability and more informed scheduling and optimization decisions.",

Although deep learning excels in this binary classification task, its \"black-box\" nature impedes biological insight. We address this by introducing a high-performance model MEDNA-DFM, alongside mechanism-inspired signal purification algorithms. Our investigation demonstrates that MEDNA-DFM effectively captures conserved methylation patterns, achieving robust distinction across diverse species. Validation on external independent datasets confirms that the model's generalization is driven by conserved intrinsic motifs (e.g., GC content) rather than phylogenetic proximity. Furthermore, applying our developed algorithms extracted motifs with significantly higher reliability than prior studies. Finally, empirical evidence from a Drosophila 6mA case study prompted us to propose a \"sequence-structure synergy\" hypothesis, suggesting that the GAGG core motif and an upstream A-tract element function cooperatively. We further validated this hypothesis via in silico mutagenesis, confirming that the ablation of either or both elements significantly degrades the model's recognition capabilities. This work provides a powerful tool for methylation prediction and demonstrates how explainable deep learning can drive both methodological innovation and the generation of biological hypotheses.",

    "abstract": "The concept of ranking aggregation plays a central role in preference analysis, and numerous algorithms for calculating median rankings, often originating in social choice theory, have been documented in the literature, offering theoretical guarantees in a centralized setting, i.e., when all the ranking data to be aggregated can be brought together in a single computing unit. For many technologies (e.g. peer-to-peer networks, IoT, multi-agent systems), extending the ability to calculate consensus rankings with guarantees in a decentralized setting, i.e., when preference data is initially distributed across a communicating network, remains a major methodological challenge. Indeed, in recent years, the literature on decentralized computation has mainly focused on computing or optimizing statistics such as arithmetic means using gossip algorithms. The purpose of this article is precisely to study how to achieve reliable consensus on collective rankings using classical rules (e.g. Borda, Copeland) in a decentralized setting, thereby raising new questions, robustness to corrupted nodes, and scalability through reduced communication costs in particular. The approach proposed and analyzed here relies on random gossip communication, allowing autonomous agents to compute global ranking consensus using only local interactions, without coordination or central authority.   We provide rigorous convergence guarantees, including explicit rate bounds, for the Borda and Copeland consensus methods. Beyond these rules, we also provide a decentralized implementation of consensus according to the median rank rule and local Kemenization. Extensive empirical evaluations on various network topologies and real and synthetic ranking datasets demonstrate that our algorithms converge quickly and reliably to the correct ranking aggregation.",

While arguments-especially about controversial topics-often appeal to emotions, most prior work has not systematically incorporated explicit, fine-grained emotion analysis to improve performance on this task. In particular, prior research on stance classification has predominantly utilized non-argumentative texts and has been restricted to specific domains or topics, limiting generalizability. We work on five datasets from diverse domains encompassing a range of controversial topics and present an approach for expanding the Bias-Corrected NRC Emotion Lexicon using DistilBERT embeddings, which we feed into a Neural Argumentative Stance Classification model. Our method systematically expands the emotion lexicon through contextualized embeddings to identify emotionally charged terms not previously captured in the lexicon. Our expanded NRC lexicon (eNRC) improves over the baseline across all five datasets (up to +6.2 percentage points in F1 score), outperforms the original NRC on four datasets (up to +3.0), and surpasses the LLM-based approach on nearly all corpora. We provide all resources-including eNRC, the adapted corpora, and model architecture-to enable other researchers to build upon our work.",

    "abstract": "Foundation models for medical imaging are typically pretrained on increasingly large datasets, following a \"scale-at-all-costs\" paradigm. However, this strategy faces two critical challenges: large-scale medical datasets often contain substantial redundancy and severe class imbalance that bias representation learning toward over-represented patterns, and indiscriminate training regardless of heterogeneity in data quality incurs considerable computational inefficiency. Here we demonstrate that active, principled data curation during pretraining can serve as a viable, cost-effective alternative to brute-force dataset enlargement. We introduce CheXficient, a chest X-ray (CXR) foundation model that selectively prioritizes informative training samples. CheXficient is pretrained on only 22.7% of 1,235,004 paired CXR images and reports while consuming under 27.3% of the total compute budget, yet achieving comparable or superior performance to its full-data counterpart and other large-scale pretrained models. We assess CheXficient across 20 individual benchmarks spanning 5 task types, including non-adapted off-the-shelf evaluations (zero-shot findings classification and crossmodal retrieval) and adapted downstream tasks (disease prediction, semantic segmentation, and radiology report generation). Further analyses show that CheXficient systematically prioritizes under-represented training samples, improving generalizability on long-tailed or rare conditions. Overall, our work offers practical insights into the data and computation demands for efficient pretraining and downstream adaptation of medical vision-language foundation models.",

However, existing presentation agents often rely on predefined workflows and fixed templates. To address this, we present DeepPresenter, an agentic framework that adapts to diverse user intents, enables effective feedback-driven refinement, and generalizes beyond a scripted pipeline. Specifically, DeepPresenter autonomously plans, renders, and revises intermediate slide artifacts to support long-horizon refinement with environmental observations. Furthermore, rather than relying on self-reflection over internal signals (e.g., reasoning traces), our environment-grounded reflection conditions the generation process on perceptual artifact states (e.g., rendered slides), enabling the system to identify and correct presentation-specific issues during execution. Results on the evaluation set covering diverse presentation-generation scenarios show that DeepPresenter achieves state-of-the-art performance, and the fine-tuned 9B model remains highly competitive at substantially lower cost.

    "abstract": "It is well known, by the Gibbard-Satterthwaite Theorem, that when there are more than two candidates, any non-dictatorial voting rule can be manipulated by untruthful voters. But how strong is the incentive to manipulate under different voting rules? We suggest measuring the potential advantage of a strategic voter by asking how many copies of their (truthful) vote must be added to the election in order to achieve an outcome as good as their best manipulation. Intuitively, this definition quantifies what a voter can gain by manipulating in comparison to what they would have gained by finding like-minded voters to join the election. The higher the former is, the more incentive a voter will have to manipulate, even when it is computationally costly.   Using this framework, we obtain a principled method to measure and compare the manipulation potential for different voting rules. We analyze and report this potential for well-known and broad classes of social choice functions. In particular, we show that the positional scoring rule with the smallest manipulation potential will always be either Borda Count (if the number of voters outweighs the number of candidates) or Plurality (vice versa). Further, we prove that any rule satisfying a weak form of majority consistency (and therefore any Condorcet-consistent rule) cannot outperform Plurality, and that any majoritarian Condorcet rule will perform significantly worse. Consequently, out of the voting rules we analyze, Borda Count stands out as the only one with a manipulation potential that does not grow with the number of voters. By establishing a clear separation between different rules in terms of manipulation potential, our work paves the way for the search for rules that provide voters with minimal incentive to manipulate.",

This study investigate how hybrid settings influence productivity and collaboration through nine interviews with three Norwegian Agile teams. Our findings show that hybrid work reduces informal interaction, creates uneven participation, and increases reliance on digital tools. Agile ceremonies became alignment anchors, while trust, communication, and tool support mediate team effectiveness.

    "abstract": "Moral benchmarks for LLMs typically use context-free prompts, implicitly assuming stable preferences. In deployment, however, prompts routinely include contextual signals such as user requests, cues on social norms, etc. that may steer decisions. We study how directed contextual influences reshape decisions in trolley-problem-style moral triage settings. We introduce a pilot evaluation harness for directed contextual influence in trolley-problem-style moral triage: for each demographic factor, we apply matched, direction-flipped contextual influences that differ only in which group they favor, enabling systematic measurement of directional response. We find that: (i) contextual influences often significantly shift decisions, even when only superficially relevant; (ii) baseline preferences are a poor predictor of directional steerability, as models can appear baseline-neutral yet exhibit systematic steerability asymmetry under influence; (iii) influences can backfire: models may explicitly claim neutrality or discount the contextual cue, yet their choices still shift, sometimes in the opposite direction; and (iv) reasoning reduces average sensitivity, but amplifies the effect of biased few-shot examples. Our findings motivate extending moral evaluations with controlled, direction-flipped context manipulations to better characterize model behavior.",

    "title": "Reflectance Multispectral Imaging for Soil Composition Estimation and USDA Texture Classification",
    "abstract": "Soil texture is a foundational attribute that governs water availability and erosion in agriculture, as well as load bearing capacity, deformation response, and shrink-swell risk in geotechnical engineering. Yet texture is still typically determined by slow and labour intensive laboratory particle size tests, while many sensing alternatives are either costly or too coarse to support routine field scale deployment. This paper proposes a robust and field deployable multispectral imaging (MSI) system and machine learning framework for predicting soil composition and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) texture classes. The proposed system uses a cost effective in-house MSI device operating from 365 nm to 940 nm to capture thirteen spectral bands, which effectively capture the spectral properties of soil texture. Regression models use the captured spectral properties to estimate clay, silt, and sand percentages, while a direct classifier predicts one of the twelve USDA textural classes. Indirect classification is obtained by mapping the regressed compositions to texture classes via the USDA soil texture triangle. The framework is evaluated on mixture data by mixing clay, silt, and sand in varying proportions, using the USDA classification triangle as a basis. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves a coefficient of determination R^2 up to 0.99 for composition prediction and over 99% accuracy for texture classification. These findings indicate that MSI combined with data-driven modeling can provide accurate, non-destructive, and field deployable soil texture characterization suitable for geotechnical screening and precision agriculture.",

    "abstract": "Background: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) technology can empower large language models (LLMs) to generate more accurate, professional, and timely responses without fine tuning. However, due to the complex reasoning processes and substantial individual differences involved in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) clinical diagnosis and treatment, traditional RAG methods often exhibit poor performance in this domain. Objective: To address the limitations of conventional RAG approaches in TCM applications, this study aims to develop an improved RAG framework tailored to the characteristics of TCM reasoning. Methods: We developed TCM-DiffRAG, an innovative RAG framework that integrates knowledge graphs (KG) with chains of thought (CoT). TCM-DiffRAG was evaluated on three distinctive TCM test datasets. Results: The experimental results demonstrated that TCM-DiffRAG achieved significant performance improvements over native LLMs. For example, the qwen-plus model achieved scores of 0.927, 0.361, and 0.038, which were significantly enhanced to 0.952, 0.788, and 0.356 with TCM-DiffRAG. The improvements were even more pronounced for non-Chinese LLMs. Additionally, TCM-DiffRAG outperformed directly supervised fine-tuned (SFT) LLMs and other benchmark RAG methods. Conclusions: TCM-DiffRAG shows that integrating structured TCM knowledge graphs with Chain of Thought based reasoning substantially improves performance in individualized diagnostic tasks. The joint use of universal and personalized knowledge graphs enables effective alignment between general knowledge and clinical reasoning. These results highlight the potential of reasoning-aware RAG frameworks for advancing LLM applications in traditional Chinese medicine.",

Through systematic evaluation of 15 state-of-the-art open- and closed-source models, we demonstrate that our hybrid evaluation improves scoring consistency by +10% compared to exact-match baselines by capturing meaning that surface-level methods cannot detect.

    "abstract": "Functional data clustering is concerned with grouping functions that share similar structure, yet most existing methods implicitly operate on sampled grids, causing cluster assignments to depend on resolution, sampling density, or preprocessing choices rather than on the underlying functions themselves. To address this limitation, we introduce a framework that maps discretized function observations -- at arbitrary resolution and on arbitrary grids -- into a fixed-dimensional vector space via an auto-encoding architecture. The encoder is a hypernetwork that maps coordinate-value pairs to the weight space of an implicit neural representation (INR), which serves as the decoder. Because INRs represent functions with very few parameters, this design yields compact representations that are decoupled from the sampling grid, while the hypernetwork amortizes weight prediction across the dataset. Clustering is then performed in this weight space using standard algorithms, making the approach agnostic to both the discretization and the choice of clustering method. By means of synthetic and real-world experiments in high-dimensional settings, we demonstrate competitive clustering performance that is robust to changes in sampling resolution -- including generalization to resolutions not seen during training.",

    "abstract": "The identification and property prediction of chemical molecules is of central importance in the advancement of drug discovery and material science, where the tandem mass spectrometry technology gives valuable fragmentation cues in the form of mass-to-charge ratio peaks. However, the lack of experimental spectra hinders the attachment of each molecular identification, and thus urges the establishment of prediction approaches for computational models. Deep learning models appear promising for predicting molecular structure spectra, but overall assessment remains challenging as a result of the heterogeneity in methods and the lack of well-defined benchmarks. To address this, our contribution is the creation of benchmark framework FlexMS for constructing and evaluating diverse model architectures in mass spectrum prediction. With its easy-to-use flexibility, FlexMS supports the dynamic construction of numerous distinct combinations of model architectures, while assessing their performance on preprocessed public datasets using different metrics. In this paper, we provide insights into factors influencing performance, including the structural diversity of datasets, hyperparameters like learning rate and data sparsity, pretraining effects, metadata ablation settings and cross-domain transfer learning analysis. This provides practical guidance in choosing suitable models. Moreover, retrieval benchmarks simulate practical identification scenarios and score potential matches based on predicted spectra.",

    "abstract": "Video polyp segmentation (VPS) is an important task in computer-aided colonoscopy, as it helps doctors accurately locate and track polyps during examinations. However, VPS remains challenging because polyps often look similar to surrounding mucosa, leading to weak semantic discrimination. In addition, large changes in polyp position and scale across video frames make stable and accurate segmentation difficult. To address these challenges, we propose a robust VPS framework named CMSA-Net. The proposed network introduces a Causal Multi-scale Aggregation (CMA) module to effectively gather semantic information from multiple historical frames at different scales. By using causal attention, CMA ensures that temporal feature propagation follows strict time order, which helps reduce noise and improve feature reliability. Furthermore, we design a Dynamic Multi-source Reference (DMR) strategy that adaptively selects informative and reliable reference frames based on semantic separability and prediction confidence. This strategy provides strong multi-frame guidance while keeping the model efficient for real-time inference. Extensive experiments on the SUN-SEG dataset demonstrate that CMSA-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance, offering a favorable balance between segmentation accuracy and real-time clinical applicability.",

    "abstract": "Face aging, an ill-posed problem shaped by environmental and genetic factors, is vital in entertainment, forensics, and digital archiving, where realistic age transformations must preserve both identity and visual realism. However, existing works relying on numerical age representations overlook the interplay of biological and contextual cues. Despite progress in recent face aging models, they struggle with identity preservation in wide age transformations, also static attention and optimization-heavy inversion in diffusion limit adaptability, fine-grained control and background consistency. To address these challenges, we propose Face Time Traveller (FaceTT), a diffusion-based framework that achieves high-fidelity, identity-consistent age transformation. Here, we introduce a Face-Attribute-Aware Prompt Refinement strategy that encodes intrinsic (biological) and extrinsic (environmental) aging cues for context-aware conditioning. A tuning-free Angular Inversion method is proposed that efficiently maps real faces into the diffusion latent space for fast and accurate reconstruction. Moreover, an Adaptive Attention Control mechanism is introduced that dynamically balances cross-attention for semantic aging cues and self-attention for structural and identity preservation. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and in-the-wild testset demonstrate that FaceTT achieves superior identity retention, background preservation and aging realism over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.",

However, development in the field of robot learning is often slowed by fragmented, closed-source tools designed to only address specific sub-components within the robotics stack.

The library is designed with a strong focus on real-world robotics, supporting accessible hardware platforms while remaining extensible to new embodiments. It also supports efficient implementations for various state-of-the-art robot learning algorithms from multiple prominent paradigms, as well as a generalized asynchronous inference stack. Unlike traditional pipelines which heavily rely on hand-crafted techniques, \\texttt{lerobot} emphasizes scalable learning approaches that improve directly with more data and compute. Designed for accessibility, scalability, and openness, \\texttt{lerobot} lowers the barrier to entry for researchers and practitioners to robotics while providing a platform for reproducible, state-of-the-art robot learning.",

    "abstract": "Group-based reinforcement learning (RL), such as GRPO, has advanced the capabilities of large language models on long-horizon agentic tasks. To enable more fine-grained policy updates, recent research has increasingly shifted toward stepwise group-based policy optimization, which treats each step in a rollout trajectory independently while using a memory module to retain historical context. However, we find a key issue in estimating stepwise relative advantages, namely context inconsistency, where steps within the same group may differ in their historical contexts. Empirically, we reveal that this issue can lead to severely biased advantage estimation, thereby degrading policy optimization significantly. To address the issue, in this paper, we propose Hierarchy-of-Groups Policy Optimization (HGPO) for long-horizon agentic tasks. Specifically, within a group of rollout trajectories, HGPO assigns each step to multiple hierarchical groups according to the consistency of historical contexts. Then, for each step, HGPO computes distinct advantages within each group and aggregates them with an adaptive weighting scheme. In this way, HGPO can achieve a favorable bias-variance trade-off in stepwise advantage estimation, without extra models or rollouts. Evaluations on two challenging agentic tasks, ALFWorld and WebShop with Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, show that HGPO significantly outperforms existing agentic RL methods under the same computational constraints.

We address this gap by proposing a conceptual model that reframes behavior as an interpretive outcome integrating Scene (observable situation), Context (user-constructed meaning), and Human Behavior Factors (determinants shaping behavioral likelihood). Grounded in multidisciplinary perspectives across the humanities, social sciences, HCI, and engineering, the model separates what is observable from what is meaningful to the user and explains how the same scene can yield different behavioral meanings and outcomes. To translate this lens into design action, we derive five agent design principles (behavioral alignment, contextual sensitivity, temporal appropriateness, motivational calibration, and agency preservation) that guide intervention depth, timing, intensity, and restraint. Together, the model and principles provide a foundation for designing agentic AI systems that act with contextual sensitivity and judgment in interactions.",

This tension is exemplified in autism spectrum disorder (ASD), where auditory sensitivities are common yet highly heterogeneous. Existing interactive music systems typically encode safety implicitly within direct input-output (I-O) mappings, which can preserve novelty but make system behavior hard to predict or audit. We instead propose a constraint-first Input-Envelope-Output (I-E-O) framework that makes safety explicit and verifiable while preserving action-output causality. I-E-O introduces a low-risk envelope layer between user input and audio output to specify safe bounds, enforce them deterministically, and log interventions for audit. From this architecture, we derive four verifiable design principles and instantiate them in MusiBubbles, a web-based prototype. Contributions include the I-E-O architecture, MusiBubbles as an exemplar implementation, and a reproducibility package to support adoption in ASD and other sensory-sensitive domains.",

Experiments using the Gemma-3 270M model and the MMLU dataset on the Raspberry Pi Zero 2W platform demonstrate that the proposed approach reduces TTFT (Time to First Token) and TTLT (Time to Last Token) by 93.12% and 50.07% on average, respectively.",

We demonstrate that by leveraging this structure, it is possible to replace the state-action level \"all policy deviation concentrability coefficient\" (Freihaut et al., arXiv:2510.09325) with a concentrability coefficient defined at the feature level which can be much smaller than the state-action analog when the features are informative about states' similarity. Furthermore, to circumvent the need for any concentrability coefficient, we turn to the interactive setting. We provide the first, computationally efficient, interactive MAIL algorithm for linear Markov games and show that its sample complexity depends only on the dimension of the feature map $d$. Building on these theoretical findings, we propose a deep MAIL interactive algorithm which clearly outperforms BC on games such as Tic-Tac-Toe and Connect4.",

    "abstract": "With the recent fast development of generative models, instruction-based image editing has shown great potential in generating high-quality images. However, the quality of editing highly depends on carefully designed instructions, placing the burden of task decomposition and sequencing entirely on the user. To achieve autonomous image editing, we present PhotoAgent, a system that advances image editing through explicit aesthetic planning. Specifically, PhotoAgent formulates autonomous image editing as a long-horizon decision-making problem. It reasons over user aesthetic intent, plans multi-step editing actions via tree search, and iteratively refines results through closed-loop execution with memory and visual feedback, without requiring step-by-step user prompts. To support reliable evaluation in real-world scenarios, we introduce UGC-Edit, an aesthetic evaluation benchmark consisting of 7,000 photos and a learned aesthetic reward model.

    "abstract": "Despite the remarkable progress of large language models (LLMs), the capabilities of standalone LLMs have begun to plateau when tackling real-world, complex tasks that require interaction with external tools and dynamic environments. Although recent agent frameworks aim to enhance model autonomy through tool integration and external interaction, they still suffer from naive workflows, unstable performance, limited support across diverse benchmarks and tasks, and heavy reliance on costly commercial APIs. In this work, we propose a high-performance and robust open-source agent framework, termed MiroFlow, which incorporates an agent graph for flexible orchestration, an optional deep reasoning mode to enhance performance, and a robust workflow execution to ensure stable and reproducible performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MiroFlow consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple agent benchmarks, including GAIA, BrowseComp-EN/ZH, HLE, xBench-DeepSearch, and notably FutureX. We hope it could serve as an easily accessible, reproducible, and comparable baseline for the deep research community.",

    "abstract": "Graph-based approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) methods (e.g., HNSW) have become the de facto state of the art for their high precision and low latency. To scale beyond main memory, recent out-of-memory ANNS systems leverage SSDs to store large vector indexes. However, they still suffer from severe CPU underutilization and read amplification (i.e., storage stalls) caused by limited access locality during graph traversal. We present VeloANN, which mitigates storage stalls through a locality-aware data layout and a coroutine-based asynchronous runtime. VeloANN utilizes hierarchical compression and affinity-based data placement scheme to co-locate related vectors within the same page, effectively reducing fragmentation and over-fetching. We further design a record-level buffer pool, where each record groups the neighbors of a vector; by persistently retaining hot records in memory, it eliminates excessive page swapping under constrained memory budgets. To minimize CPU scheduling overheads during disk I/O interruptions, VeloANN employs a coroutine-based asynchronous runtime for lightweight task scheduling. On top of this, it incorporates asynchronous prefetching and a beam-aware search strategy to prioritize cached data, ultimately improving overall search efficiency. Extensive experiments show that VeloANN outperforms state-of-the-art disk-based ANN systems by up to 5.8x in throughput and 3.25x in latency reduction, while achieving 0.92x the throughput of in-memory systems using only 10% of their memory footprint.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a multi-mutation optimization algorithm, Differential Evolution with Multi-Mutation Operator-Guided Communication (DE-MMOGC), implemented to improve the performance and convergence abilities of standard differential evolution in uncertain environments. DE-MMOGC introduces a communication-guided scheme integrated with multiple mutation operators to encourage exploration and avoid premature convergence. Along with this, it includes a dynamic operator selection mechanism to use the best-performing operator over successive generations. To assimilate real-world uncertainties and missing observations into the predictive model, the proposed algorithm is combined with the Ensemble Kalman Filter. To evaluate the efficacy of the proposed DE-MMOGC in uncertain systems, the unified framework is applied to improve the predictive accuracy of crop simulation models. These simulation models are essential to precision agriculture, as they make it easier to estimate crop growth in a variety of unpredictable weather scenarios. Additionally, precisely calibrating these models raises a challenge due to missing observations. Hence, the simplified WOFOST crop simulation model is incorporated in this study for leaf area index (LAI)-based crop yield estimation. DE-MMOGC enhances the WOFOST performance by optimizing crucial weather parameters (temperature and rainfall), since these parameters are highly uncertain across different crop varieties, such as wheat, rice, and cotton. The experimental study shows that DE-MMOGC outperforms the traditional evolutionary optimizers and achieves better correlation with real LAI values. We found that DE-MMOGC is a resilient solution for crop monitoring.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have become a popular choice for decision-making tasks in robotics, and more recently, are also being considered for solving autonomous driving tasks. However, their applications and evaluations in autonomous driving remain limited to simulation-based or laboratory settings. The full strength of diffusion models for large-scale, complex real-world settings, such as End-to-End Autonomous Driving (E2E AD), remains underexplored. In this study, we conducted a systematic and large-scale investigation to unleash the potential of the diffusion models as planners for E2E AD, based on a tremendous amount of real-vehicle data and road testing. Through comprehensive and carefully controlled studies, we identify key insights into the diffusion loss space, trajectory representation, and data scaling that significantly impact E2E planning performance. Moreover, we also provide an effective reinforcement learning post-training strategy to further enhance the safety of the learned planner. The resulting diffusion-based learning framework, Hyper Diffusion Planner} (HDP), is deployed on a real-vehicle platform and evaluated across 6 urban driving scenarios and 200 km of real-world testing, achieving a notable 10x performance improvement over the base model. Our work demonstrates that diffusion models, when properly designed and trained, can serve as effective and scalable E2E AD planners for complex, real-world autonomous driving tasks.",

    "abstract": "Atmospheric turbulence causes significant image degradation due to pixel displacement (tilt) and blur, particularly in long-range imaging applications. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for atmospheric turbulence mitigation, GSTurb, which integrates optical flow-guided tilt correction and Gaussian splatting for modeling non-isoplanatic blur. The framework employs Gaussian parameters to represent tilt and blur, and optimizes them across multiple frames to enhance restoration. Experimental results on the ATSyn-static dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving a peak PSNR of 27.67 dB and SSIM of 0.8735. Compared to the state-of-the-art method, GSTurb improves PSNR by 1.3 dB (a 4.5% increase) and SSIM by 0.048 (a 5.8% increase). Additionally, on real datasets, including the TSRWGAN Real-World and CLEAR datasets, GSTurb outperforms existing methods, showing significant improvements in both qualitative and quantitative performance. These results highlight that combining optical flow-guided tilt correction with Gaussian splatting effectively enhances image restoration under both synthetic and real-world turbulence conditions.

    "abstract": "Air-based molecular communication (MC) has the potential to be one of the first MC systems to be deployed in real-world applications, enabled by commercially available sensors. However, these sensors usually exhibit non-linear and cross-reactive behavior, contrary to the idealizing assumption of linear and perfectly molecule type-specific sensing often made in the MC literature. To address this mismatch, we propose several detectors and transmission schemes for a molecule mixture communication system where the receiver (RX) employs non-linear, cross-reactive sensors. All proposed schemes are based on the first- and second-order moments of the symbol likelihoods that are fed through the non-linear RX using the Unscented Transform. In particular, we propose an approximate maximum likelihood (AML) symbol-by-symbol detector for inter-symbol-interference (ISI)-free transmission scenarios and a complementary mixture alphabet design algorithm which accounts for the RX characteristics. When significant ISI is present at high data rates, the AML detector can be adapted to exploit statistical ISI knowledge. Additionally, we propose a sequence detector which combines information from multiple symbol intervals. For settings where sequence detection is not possible due to extremely limited computational power at the RX, we propose an adaptive transmission scheme which can be combined with symbol-by-symbol detection. Using computer simulations, we validate all proposed detectors and algorithms based on the responses of commercially available sensors as well as artificially generated sensor data incorporating the characteristics of metal-oxide semiconductor sensors. By employing a general system model that accounts for transmitter noise, ISI, and general non-linear, cross-reactive RX arrays, this work enables reliable communication for a large class of MC systems.",

This paper proposes an interpretable framework to tackle beam alignment in mixed line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) propagation environments. Our approach utilizes multi-modal data to construct virtual base stations (VBSs), which are geometrically defined as mirror images of the base station across reflecting surfaces reconstructed from 3D LiDAR points. These VBSs provide a sparse and spatial representation of the dominant features of the wireless environment. Based on the constructed VBSs, we develop a VBS-assisted beam alignment scheme comprising coarse channel reconstruction followed by partial beam training. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves near-optimal performance in terms of spectral efficiency.",

    "abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) networks face significant challenges such as limited communication bandwidth, constrained computational and energy resources, and highly dynamic wireless channel conditions. Utilization of deep neural networks (DNNs) combined with semantic communication has emerged as a promising paradigm to address these limitations. Deep joint source-channel coding (DJSCC) has recently been proposed to enable semantic communication of images. Building upon the original DJSCC formulation, low-complexity attention-style architectures has been added to the DNNs for further performance enhancement. As a main hurdle, training these DNNs separately for various signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) will amount to excessive storage or communication overhead, which can not be maintained by small IoT devices. SNR Adaptive DJSCC (ADJSCC), has been proposed to train the DNNs once but feed the current SNR as part of the data to the channel-wise attention mechanism. We improve upon ADJSCC by a simultaneous utilization of doubly adaptive channel-wise and spatial attention modules at both transmitter and receiver. These modules dynamically adjust to varying channel conditions and spatial feature importance, enabling robust and efficient feature extraction and semantic information recovery. Simulation results corroborate that our proposed doubly adaptive DJSCC (DA-DJSCC) significantly improves upon ADJSCC in several performance criteria, while incurring a mild increase in complexity. These facts render DA-DJSCC a desirable choice for semantic communication in performance demanding but low-complexity IoT networks.",

We propose a robust trajectory prediction method that incorporates a self-supervised skeleton representation model pretrained with masked autoencoding. Experimental results in occlusion-prone scenarios show that our method improves robustness to missing skeletal data without sacrificing prediction accuracy, and consistently outperforms baseline models in clean-to-moderate missingness regimes.",

    "abstract": "The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) has transformed prompt engineering from a localized craft into a systems-level governance challenge. As models scale and update across generations, prompt behavior becomes sensitive to shifts in instruction-following policies, alignment regimes, and decoding strategies, a phenomenon we characterize as GPT-scale model drift. Under such conditions, surface-level formatting conventions and ad hoc refinement are insufficient to ensure stable, interpretable control. This paper reconceptualizes Natural Language Declarative Prompting (NLD-P) as a declarative governance method rather than a rigid field template. NLD-P is formalized as a modular control abstraction that separates provenance, constraint logic, task content, and post-generation evaluation, encoded directly in natural language without reliance on external orchestration code. We define minimal compliance criteria, analyze model-dependent schema receptivity, and position NLD-P as an accessible governance framework for non-developer practitioners operating within evolving LLM ecosystems. Portions of drafting and editorial refinement employed a schema-bound LLM assistant configured under NLD-P. All conceptual framing, methodological claims, and final revisions were directed, reviewed, and approved by the human author under a documented human-in-the-loop protocol. The paper concludes by outlining implications for declarative control under ongoing model evolution and identifying directions for future empirical validation.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) often generate fluent but unfounded claims, or hallucinations, which fall into two types: (i) faithfulness violations - misusing user context - and (ii) factuality violations - errors from internal knowledge. Proper mitigation depends on knowing whether a model's answer is based on the prompt or its internal weights. This work focuses on the problem of contributive attribution: identifying the dominant knowledge source behind each output. We show that a probe, a simple linear classifier trained on model hidden representations, can reliably predict contributive attribution. For its training, we introduce AttriWiki, a self-supervised data pipeline that prompts models to recall withheld entities from memory or read them from context, generating labelled examples automatically. Probes trained on AttriWiki data reveal a strong attribution signal, achieving up to 0.96 Macro-F1 on Llama-3.1-8B, Mistral-7B, and Qwen-7B, transferring to out-of-domain benchmarks (SQuAD, WebQuestions) with 0.94-0.99 Macro-F1 without retraining. Attribution mismatches raise error rates by up to 70%, demonstrating a direct link between knowledge source confusion and unfaithful answers. Yet, models may still respond incorrectly even when attribution is correct, highlighting the need for broader detection frameworks.",

    "abstract": "Value decomposition (VD) methods have achieved remarkable success in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). However, their reliance on the max operator for temporal-difference (TD) target calculation leads to systematic Q-value overestimation. This issue is particularly severe in MARL due to the combinatorial explosion of the joint action space, which often results in unstable learning and suboptimal policies. To address this problem, we propose QSIM, a similarity weighted Q-learning framework that reconstructs the TD target using action similarity. Instead of using the greedy joint action directly, QSIM forms a similarity weighted expectation over a structured near-greedy joint action space. This formulation allows the target to integrate Q-values from diverse yet behaviorally related actions while assigning greater influence to those that are more similar to the greedy choice. By smoothing the target with structurally relevant alternatives, QSIM effectively mitigates overestimation and improves learning stability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that QSIM can be seamlessly integrated with various VD methods, consistently yielding superior performance and stability compared to the original algorithms. Furthermore, empirical analysis confirms that QSIM significantly mitigates the systematic value overestimation in MARL. Code is available at https://github.com/MaoMaoLYJ/pymarl-qsim.",

    "abstract": "We introduce SceneTransporter, an end-to-end framework for structured 3D scene generation from a single image. While existing methods generate part-level 3D objects, they often fail to organize these parts into distinct instances in open-world scenes. Through a debiased clustering probe, we reveal a critical insight: this failure stems from the lack of structural constraints within the model's internal assignment mechanism. Based on this finding, we reframe the task of structured 3D scene generation as a global correlation assignment problem. To solve this, SceneTransporter formulates and solves an entropic Optimal Transport (OT) objective within the denoising loop of the compositional DiT model. This formulation imposes two powerful structural constraints. First, the resulting transport plan gates cross-attention to enforce an exclusive, one-to-one routing of image patches to part-level 3D latents, preventing entanglement. Second, the competitive nature of the transport encourages the grouping of similar patches, a process that is further regularized by an edge-based cost, to form coherent objects and prevent fragmentation. Extensive experiments show that SceneTransporter outperforms existing methods on open-world scene generation, significantly improving instance-level coherence and geometric fidelity.

    "abstract": "This study targets cloud native environments where microservice invocation relations are complex, load fluctuations are multi-scale and superimposed, and cross-service impacts are significant. We propose a structured temporal joint load prediction framework oriented to microservice topology. The method represents the system as a coupled entity of a time-evolving service invocation graph and multivariate load sequences. It constructs neighborhood-aggregated and global summarized views based on service level observations. This forms layered load representations across instance, service, and cluster levels. A unified sequence encoder models multi-scale historical context. To strengthen the expression of invocation dependencies, the framework introduces a lightweight structural prior into attention computation. This enables more effective capture of load propagation and accumulation along invocation chains, while maintaining consistent modeling of local bursts and overall trends. The training objective adopts a multi-objective regression strategy that jointly optimizes service level and cluster level predictions to improve cross-granularity stability. We further conduct single-factor sensitivity analyses on key structural and training hyperparameters. We systematically examine the effects of time window length, encoding depth, and regularization strength. The results support the necessity of multi-granularity fusion and structural injection and clarify their effective configuration ranges. Overall, the framework provides a reusable modeling paradigm and implementation path for capacity assessment, resource orchestration, and runtime situational understanding in cloud environments.",

    "abstract": "Tokenization in video models, typically through patchification, generates an excessive and redundant number of tokens. This severely limits video efficiency and scalability. While recent trajectory-based tokenizers offer a promising solution by decoupling video duration from token count, they rely on complex external segmentation and tracking pipelines that are slow and task-agnostic. We propose TrajTok, an end-to-end video tokenizer module that is fully integrated and co-trained with video models for a downstream objective, dynamically adapting its token granularity to semantic complexity, independent of video duration. TrajTok contains a unified segmenter that performs implicit clustering over pixels in both space and time to directly produce object trajectories in a single forward pass. By prioritizing downstream adaptability over pixel-perfect segmentation fidelity, TrajTok is lightweight and efficient, yet empirically improves video understanding performance. With TrajTok, we implement a video CLIP model trained from scratch (TrajViT2). It achieves the best accuracy at scale across both classification and retrieval benchmarks, while maintaining efficiency comparable to the best token-merging methods. TrajTok also proves to be a versatile component beyond its role as a tokenizer. We show that it can be seamlessly integrated as either a probing head for pretrained visual features (TrajAdapter) or an alignment connector in vision-language models (TrajVLM) with especially strong performance in long-video reasoning.",

    "abstract": "Predictive modeling on web-scale tabular data with billions of instances and hundreds of heterogeneous numerical features faces significant scalability challenges. These features exhibit anisotropy, heavy-tailed distributions, and non-stationarity, creating bottlenecks for models like Gradient Boosting Decision Trees and requiring laborious manual feature engineering. We introduce KMLP, a hybrid deep architecture integrating a shallow Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) front-end with a Gated Multilayer Perceptron (gMLP) backbone. The KAN front-end uses learnable activation functions to automatically model complex non-linear transformations for each feature, while the gMLP backbone captures high-order interactions. Experiments on public benchmarks and an industrial dataset with billions of samples show KMLP achieves state-of-the-art performance, with advantages over baselines like GBDTs increasing at larger scales, validating KMLP as a scalable deep learning paradigm for large-scale web tabular data.",

    "abstract": "As mental health chatbots proliferate to address the global treatment gap, a critical question emerges: How do we design for relational safety the quality of interaction patterns that unfold across conversations rather than the correctness of individual responses? Current safety evaluations assess single-turn crisis responses, missing the therapeutic dynamics that determine whether chatbots help or harm over time. We introduce TherapyProbe, a design probe methodology that generates actionable design knowledge by systematically exploring chatbot conversation trajectories through adversarial multi-agent simulation. Using open-source models, TherapyProbe surfaces relational safety failures interaction patterns like \"validation spirals\" where chatbots progressively reinforce hopelessness, or \"empathy fatigue\" where responses become mechanical over turns. Our contribution is translating these failures into a Safety Pattern Library of 23 failure archetypes with corresponding design recommendations. We contribute: (1) a replicable methodology requiring no API costs, (2) a clinically-grounded failure taxonomy, and (3) design implications for developers, clinicians, and policymakers.",

Clinical experts must identify whether available information is sufficient for judgment, as both premature conclusion and unnecessary abstention can compromise patient safety. To evaluate this capability of large language models (LLMs), we developed ClinDet-Bench, a benchmark based on clinical scoring systems that decomposes incomplete-information scenarios into determinable and undeterminable conditions. Identifying determinability requires considering all hypotheses about missing information, including unlikely ones, and verifying whether the conclusion holds across them. We find that recent LLMs fail to identify determinability under incomplete information, producing both premature judgments and excessive abstention, despite correctly explaining the underlying scoring knowledge and performing well under complete information. These findings suggest that existing benchmarks are insufficient to evaluate the safety of LLMs in clinical settings. ClinDet-Bench provides a framework for evaluating determinability recognition, leading to appropriate abstention, with potential applicability to medicine and other high-stakes domains, and is publicly available.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are deployed as autonomous agents in increasingly complex applications, where enabling long-horizon memory is critical for achieving strong performance. However, a significant gap exists between practical applications and current evaluation standards for agent memory: existing benchmarks primarily focus on dialogue-centric, human-agent interactions. In reality, agent memory consists of a continuous stream of agent-environment interactions that are primarily composed of machine-generated representations. To bridge this gap, we introduce AMA-Bench (Agent Memory with Any length), which evaluates long-horizon memory for LLMs in real agentic applications. It features two key components: (1) a set of real-world agentic trajectories across representative agentic applications, paired with expert-curated QA, and (2) a set of synthetic agentic trajectories that scale to arbitrary horizons, paired with rule-based QA. Our comprehensive study shows that existing memory systems underperform on AMA-Bench primarily because they lack causality and objective information and are constrained by the lossy nature of similarity-based retrieval employed by many memory systems. To address these limitations, we propose AMA-Agent, an effective memory system featuring a causality graph and tool-augmented retrieval. Our results demonstrate that AMA-Agent achieves 57.22% average accuracy on AMA-Bench, surpassing the strongest memory system baselines by 11.16%.",

    "abstract": "Latent visual reasoning aims to mimic human's imagination process by meditating through hidden states of Multimodal Large Language Models. While recognized as a promising paradigm for visual reasoning, the underlying mechanisms driving its effectiveness remain unclear. Motivated to demystify the true source of its efficacy, we investigate the validity of latent reasoning using Causal Mediation Analysis. We model the process as a causal chain: the input as the treatment, the latent tokens as the mediator, and the final answer as the outcome. Our findings uncover two critical disconnections: (a) Input-Latent Disconnect: dramatic perturbations on the input result in negligible changes to the latent tokens, suggesting that latent tokens do not effectively attend to the input sequence. (b) Latent-Answer Disconnect: perturbations on the latent tokens yield minimal impact on the final answer, indicating the limited causal effect latent tokens imposing on the outcome. Furthermore, extensive probing analysis reveals that latent tokens encode limited visual information and exhibit high similarity. Consequently, we challenge the necessity of latent reasoning and propose a straightforward alternative named CapImagine, which teaches the model to explicitly imagine using text. Experiments on vision-centric benchmarks show that CapImagine significantly outperforms complex latent-space baselines, highlighting the superior potential of visual reasoning through explicit imagination.",

To tackle this problem, we further introduce the concept of second-order rollout (generating multiple critiques for a response) and propose a unified framework for jointly training generation and critique capabilities. Extensive experiments across various models and datasets demonstrate that our approach can utilize training data more effectively than vanilla RL and achieve better performance under the same training data. Additionally, we uncover several insightful findings regarding second-order rollout and critique training, such as the importance of label balance in critique training and the noise problem of outcome-based rewards, which can be mitigated through sampling techniques. Our work offers a preliminary exploration of dynamic data augmentation and joint generation-critique training in RL, providing meaningful inspiration for the further advancement of RL training",

    "abstract": "The Rust programming language presents a steep learning curve and significant coding challenges, making the automation of issue resolution essential for its broader adoption. Recently, LLM-powered code agents have shown remarkable success in resolving complex software engineering tasks, yet their application to Rust has been limited by the absence of a large-scale, repository-level benchmark. To bridge this gap, we introduce Rust-SWE-bench, a benchmark comprising 500 real-world, repository-level software engineering tasks from 34 diverse and popular Rust repositories. We then perform a comprehensive study on Rust-SWE-bench with four representative agents and four state-of-the-art LLMs to establish a foundational understanding of their capabilities and limitations in the Rust ecosystem. Our extensive study reveals that while ReAct-style agents are promising, i.e., resolving up to 21.2% of issues, they are limited by two primary challenges: comprehending repository-wide code structure and complying with Rust's strict type and trait semantics. We also find that issue reproduction is rather critical for task resolution. Inspired by these findings, we propose RUSTFORGER, a novel agentic approach that integrates an automated test environment setup with a Rust metaprogramming-driven dynamic tracing strategy to facilitate reliable issue reproduction and dynamic analysis. The evaluation shows that RUSTFORGER using Claude-Sonnet-3.7 significantly outperforms all baselines, resolving 28.6% of tasks on Rust-SWE-bench, i.e., a 34.9% improvement over the strongest baseline, and, in aggregate, uniquely solves 46 tasks that no other agent could solve across all adopted advanced LLMs.",

    "abstract": "This study addresses the challenge that generative models struggle to balance flexibility, stability, and controllability in complex interactive scenarios. It proposes a controllable generation framework for dynamic interactive content construction. The framework builds a structured semantic state space that encodes user input, environmental conditions, and historical context into actionable latent representations and generates directional control vectors to guide the content generation process. It introduces multilevel constraints, including semantic consistency constraints, structural stability constraints, and semantic drift penalties, which help the model maintain clear semantic paths and coherent logic in dynamic environments. These constraints prevent content deviation, unstable tone, or structural breaks. Based on these components, the study designs a systematic controllable generation pipeline in which semantic modeling, control signals, and generation strategies work together within one framework. Sensitivity analyses on control vector dimension, hidden layer size, noise intensity, and training sample scale are conducted on a public dialogue dataset to validate the framework. The results show that the approach improves semantic structure, contextual consistency, and controllable expression, providing a structured and effective solution for interactive content generation.",

    "abstract": "Training large language models (LLMs) requires substantial compute and energy. At the same time, renewable energy sources regularly produce more electricity than the grid can absorb, leading to curtailment, the deliberate reduction of clean generation that would otherwise go to waste. These periods represent an opportunity: if training is aligned with curtailment windows, LLMs can be pretrained using electricity that is both clean and cheap. This technical report presents a system that performs full-parameter LLM training across geo-distributed GPU clusters during regional curtailment windows, elastically switching between local single-site training and federated multi-site synchronization as sites become available or unavailable. Our prototype trains a 561M-parameter transformer model across three clusters using the Flower federated learning framework, with curtailment periods derived from real-world marginal carbon intensity traces. Preliminary results show that curtailment-aware scheduling preserves training quality while reducing operational emissions to 5-12% of single-site baselines.",

Rubric identity accounts for 15.8% of met/not-met label variance but only 3.6-6.9% of disagreement variance; physician identity accounts for just 2.4%. The dominant 81.8% case-level residual is not reduced by HealthBench's metadata labels (z = -0.22, p = 0.83), normative rubric language (pseudo R^2 = 1.2%), medical specialty (0/300 Tukey pairs significant), surface-feature triage (AUC = 0.58), or embeddings (AUC = 0.485). Disagreement follows an inverted-U with completion quality (AUC = 0.689), confirming physicians agree on clearly good or bad outputs but split on borderline cases. Physician-validated uncertainty categories reveal that reducible uncertainty (missing context, ambiguous phrasing) more than doubles disagreement odds (OR = 2.55, p < 10^(-24)), while irreducible uncertainty (genuine medical ambiguity) has no effect (OR = 1.01, p = 0.90), though even the former explains only ~3% of total variance. The agreement ceiling in medical AI evaluation is thus largely structural, but the reducible/irreducible dissociation suggests that closing information gaps in evaluation scenarios could lower disagreement where inherent clinical ambiguity does not, pointing toward actionable evaluation design improvements.",

    "abstract": "All-to-all GPU communication is a critical bottleneck in large-scale training clusters, where completion time is constrained by per-port bandwidth and can be severely impacted by traffic skew across GPUs and network interface cards (NICs). This issue is amplified by the two-tier structure of modern GPU systems, which combine fast intra-server links with much slower inter-server networks. Motivated by recent system observations that highlight the importance of traffic reshaping and hierarchy awareness, we study all-to-all scheduling from an online switching and queueing-theoretic perspective.   We propose a dynamic hierarchical Birkhoff--von Neumann (BvN) decomposition framework tailored to two-tier GPU fabrics. At each frame boundary, traffic is first balanced within each server using simple local operations to mitigate micro-level GPU/NIC skew while preserving aggregate server-to-server demand. A hierarchical BvN decomposition is then applied at the server level and refined into GPU-level matchings, significantly reducing decomposition complexity relative to a flat GPU-level approach. By integrating this construction with the dynamic frame sizing (DFS) principle, we obtain an online scheduler with provable stability under admissible Poisson arrivals. Simulations demonstrate substantial reductions in mean frame length, particularly under server-localized hotspot traffic.",

Each model has one of 14 concerning behaviors--such as sycophantic deference, opposition to AI regulation, or secret geopolitical loyalties--which it does not confess to when directly asked. AuditBench models are highly diverse--some are subtle, while others are overt, and we use varying training techniques both for implanting behaviors and training models not to confess. To demonstrate AuditBench's utility, we develop an investigator agent that autonomously employs a configurable set of auditing tools. By measuring investigator agent success using different tools, we can evaluate their efficacy. Notably, we observe a tool-to-agent gap, where tools that perform well in standalone non-agentic evaluations fail to translate into improved performance when used with our investigator agent. We find that our most effective tools involve scaffolded calls to auxiliary models that generate diverse prompts for the target. White-box interpretability tools can be helpful, but the agent performs best with black-box tools. We also find that audit success varies greatly across training techniques: models trained on synthetic documents are easier to audit than models trained on demonstrations, with better adversarial training further increasing auditing difficulty. We release our models, agent, and evaluation framework to support future quantitative, iterative science on alignment auditing.",

This study introduces Conditioned Comment Prediction (CCP), a task in which a model predicts how a user would comment on a given stimulus by comparing generated outputs with authentic digital traces. This framework enables a rigorous evaluation of current LLM capabilities with respect to the simulation of social media user behavior. We evaluated open-weight 8B models (Llama3.1, Qwen3, Ministral) in English, German, and Luxembourgish language scenarios. By systematically comparing prompting strategies (explicit vs. implicit) and the impact of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), we identify a critical form vs. content decoupling in low-resource settings: while SFT aligns the surface structure of the text output (length and syntax), it degrades semantic grounding. Furthermore, we demonstrate that explicit conditioning (generated biographies) becomes redundant under fine-tuning, as models successfully perform latent inference directly from behavioral histories. Our findings challenge current \"naive prompting\" paradigms and offer operational guidelines prioritizing authentic behavioral traces over descriptive personas for high-fidelity simulation.",

    "title": "Know What You Know: Metacognitive Entropy Calibration for Verifiable RL Reasoning",
    "abstract": "Large reasoning models (LRMs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for solving complex real-world tasks. In practice, these models are predominantly trained via Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), yet most existing outcome-only RLVR pipelines rely almost exclusively on a binary correctness signal and largely ignore the model's intrinsic uncertainty. We term this discrepancy the uncertainty-reward mismatch, under which high- and low-uncertainty solutions are treated equivalently, preventing the policy from \"Know What You Know\" and impeding the shift from optimizing for correct answers to optimizing effective reasoning paths. This limitation is especially critical in reasoning-centric tasks such as mathematics and question answering, where performance hinges on the quality of the model's internal reasoning process rather than mere memorization of final answers. To address this, we propose EGPO, a metacognitive entropy calibration framework that explicitly integrates intrinsic uncertainty into RLVR for enhancing LRMs. EGPO estimates per-sample uncertainty using a zero-overhead entropy proxy derived from token-level likelihoods and aligns it with extrinsic correctness through an asymmetric calibration mechanism that preserves correct reasoning while selectively regulating overconfident failures, thereby enabling stable and uncertainty-aware policy optimization. Moreover, EGPO recovers informative learning signals from otherwise degenerate group-based rollouts without modifying the verifier or reward definition. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed EGPO leads to substantial and consistent improvements in reasoning performance, establishing a principled path for advancing LRMs through metacognitive entropy calibration.",

    "title": "The Inference Bottleneck: Antitrust and Neutrality Duties in the Age of Cognitive Infrastructure",
    "abstract": "As generative AI commercializes, competitive advantage is shifting from one-time model training toward continuous inference, distribution, and routing. At the frontier, large-scale inference can function as cognitive infrastructure: a bottleneck input that downstream applications rely on to compete, controlled by firms that often compete downstream through integrated assistants, productivity suites, and developer tooling. Foreclosure risk is not limited to price. It can be executed through non-price discrimination (latency, throughput, error rates, context limits, feature gating) and, where models select tools and services, through steering and default routing that is difficult to observe and harder to litigate. This essay makes three moves. First, it defines cognitive infrastructure as a falsifiable concept built around measurable reliance, vertical incentives, and discrimination capacity, without assuming a clean market definition. Second, it frames theories of harm using raising-rivals'-costs logic for vertically related and platform markets, where foreclosure can be profitable without anticompetitive pricing. Third, it proposes Neutral Inference: a targeted, auditable conduct approach built around (i) quality-of-service parity, (ii) routing transparency, and (iii) FRAND-style non-discrimination for similarly situated buyers, applied only when observable evidence indicates functional gatekeeper status.",

    "abstract": "Epistemic uncertainty in neural networks is commonly modeled using two second-order paradigms: distribution-based representations, which rely on posterior parameter distributions, and set-based representations based on credal sets (convex sets of probability distributions). These frameworks are often regarded as fundamentally non-comparable due to differing semantics, assumptions, and evaluation practices, leaving their relative merits unclear. Empirical comparisons are further confounded by variations in the underlying predictive models. To clarify this issue, we present a controlled comparative study enabling principled, like-for-like evaluation of the two paradigms. Both representations are constructed from the same finite collection of predictive distributions generated by a shared neural network, isolating representational effects from predictive accuracy. Our study evaluates each representation through the lens of 3 uncertainty measures across 8 benchmarks, including selective prediction and out-of-distribution detection, spanning 6 underlying predictive models and 10 independent runs per configuration. Our results show that meaningful comparison between these seemingly non-comparable frameworks is both feasible and informative, providing insights into how second-order representation choices impact practical uncertainty-aware performance.",

To address common challenges like data sparsity and cold start, recent researchs have leveraged data from multiple auxiliary domains to enrich information within the target domain. However, inherent domain gaps can degrade the quality of mixed-domain data, leading to negative transfer and diminished model performance. Existing prevailing \\emph{model-centric} paradigm -- which relies on complex, customized architectures -- struggles to capture the subtle, non-structural sequence dependencies across domains, leading to poor generalization and high demands on computational resources.

    "abstract": "Generating human motion with precise spatial control is a challenging problem. Existing approaches often require task-specific training or slow optimization, and enforcing hard constraints frequently disrupts motion naturalness. Building on the observation that many animation tasks can be formulated as a linear inverse problem, we introduce ProjFlow, a training-free sampler that achieves zero-shot, exact satisfaction of linear spatial constraints while preserving motion realism. Our key advance is a novel kinematics-aware metric that encodes skeletal topology. This metric allows the sampler to enforce hard constraints by distributing corrections coherently across the entire skeleton, avoiding the unnatural artifacts of naive projection. Furthermore, for sparse inputs, such as filling in long gaps between a few keyframes, we introduce a time-varying formulation using pseudo-observations that fade during sampling. Extensive experiments on representative applications, motion inpainting, and 2D-to-3D lifting, demonstrate that ProjFlow achieves exact constraint satisfaction and matches or improves realism over zero-shot baselines, while remaining competitive with training-based controllers.",

These models instantiate a simulated reader that allocates limited cognitive resources, such as attention, memory, and time under task demands, enabling systematic evaluation of text user interfaces. We introduce two complementary optimization pipelines: an offline approach that explores design alternatives using simulated readers, and an online approach that personalizes reading interfaces in real time using ongoing interaction data. Together, this perspective enables adaptive, explainable, and scalable augmented reading design without relying solely on human testing.",

We design a systematic analysis: given either a generated caption or the corresponding image, we train neural networks to predict the originating caption model. Our results show that text classification yields very high accuracy (99.70\\%), indicating that captioning models embed distinctive stylistic signatures. In contrast, these signatures largely disappear in the generated images, with classification accuracy dropping to at most 50\\% even for the state-of-the-art Flux model. To better understand this cross-modal discrepancy, we further analyze the data and find that the generated images fail to preserve key variations present in captions, such as differences in the level of detail, emphasis on color and texture, and the distribution of objects within a scene. Overall, our classification-based framework provides a novel methodology for quantifying both the stylistic idiosyncrasies of caption models and the prompt-following ability of text-to-image systems.",

Such visual cues capture changes in the object's position and scale, allowing the policy to reason about the object's motion. Furthermore, to achieve stable learning in a high-DoF system composed of a robot arm equipped with a multi-fingered hand, we design a heterogeneous multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that defines the arm and hand as independent agents with distinct roles.

    "abstract": "Generative recommendation has recently attracted widespread attention in industry due to its potential for scaling and stronger model capacity. However, deploying real-time generative recommendation in large-scale advertising requires designs beyond large-language-model (LLM)-style training and serving recipes. We present a production-oriented generative recommender co-designed across architecture, learning, and serving, named GR4AD (Generative Recommendation for ADdvertising). As for tokenization, GR4AD proposes UA-SID (Unified Advertisement Semantic ID) to capture complicated business information. Furthermore, GR4AD introduces LazyAR, a lazy autoregressive decoder that relaxes layer-wise dependencies for short, multi-candidate generation, preserving effectiveness while reducing inference cost, which facilitates scaling under fixed serving budgets. To align optimization with business value, GR4AD employs VSL (Value-Aware Supervised Learning) and proposes RSPO (Ranking-Guided Softmax Preference Optimization), a ranking-aware, list-wise reinforcement learning algorithm that optimizes value-based rewards under list-level metrics for continual online updates. For online inference, we further propose dynamic beam serving, which adapts beam width across generation levels and online load to control compute. Large-scale online A/B tests show up to 4.2% ad revenue improvement over an existing DLRM-based stack, with consistent gains from both model scaling and inference-time scaling. GR4AD has been fully deployed in Kuaishou advertising system with over 400 million users and achieves high-throughput real-time serving.",

    "abstract": "Saplings are key indicators of forest regeneration and overall forest health. However, their fine-scale architectural traits are difficult to capture with existing 3D sensing methods, which make quantitative evaluation difficult. Terrestrial Laser Scanners (TLS), Mobile Laser Scanners (MLS), or traditional photogrammetry approaches poorly reconstruct thin branches, dense foliage, and lack the scale consistency needed for long-term monitoring. Implicit 3D reconstruction methods such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) are promising alternatives, but cannot recover the true scale of a scene and lack any means to be accurately geo-localised. In this paper, we present a pipeline which fuses NeRF, LiDAR SLAM, and GNSS to enable repeatable, geo-localised ecological monitoring of saplings. Our system proposes a three-level representation: (i) coarse Earth-frame localisation using GNSS, (ii) LiDAR-based SLAM for centimetre-accurate localisation and reconstruction, and (iii) NeRF-derived object-centric dense reconstruction of individual saplings. This approach enables repeatable quantitative evaluation and long-term monitoring of sapling traits. Our experiments in forest plots in Wytham Woods (Oxford, UK) and Evo (Finland) show that stem height, branching patterns, and leaf-to-wood ratios can be captured with increased accuracy as compared to TLS. We demonstrate that accurate stem skeletons and leaf distributions can be measured for saplings with heights between 0.5m and 2m in situ, giving ecologists access to richer structural and quantitative data for analysing forest dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Seed explosion is a fundamental problem in fuzzing seed scheduling, where a fuzzer maintains a huge corpus and fails to choose promising seeds. Existing works focus on seed prioritization but still suffer from seed explosion since corpus size remains huge. We tackle this from a new perspective: corpus reduction, i.e., computing a seed corpus subset. However, corpus reduction could lead to poor seed diversity and large runtime overhead. Prior techniques like cull_queue, AFL-Cmin, and MinSet suffer from poor diversity or prohibitive overhead, making them unsuitable for high-frequency seed scheduling.   We propose RandSet, a novel randomized corpus reduction technique that reduces corpus size and yields diverse seed selection simultaneously with minimal overhead. Our key insight is introducing randomness into corpus reduction to enjoy two benefits of a randomized algorithm: randomized output (diverse seed selection) and low runtime cost. Specifically, we formulate corpus reduction as a set cover problem and compute a randomized subset covering all features of the entire corpus. We then schedule seeds from this small, randomized subset rather than the entire corpus, effectively mitigating seed explosion.   We implement RandSet on three popular fuzzers: AFL++, LibAFL, and Centipede, and evaluate it on standalone programs, FuzzBench, and Magma. Results show RandSet achieves significantly more diverse seed selection than other reduction techniques, with average subset ratios of 4.03% and 5.99% on standalone and FuzzBench programs. RandSet achieves a 16.58% coverage gain on standalone programs and up to 3.57% on FuzzBench in AFL++, triggers up to 7 more ground-truth bugs than the state-of-the-art on Magma, while introducing only 1.17%-3.93% overhead.",

Existing methods struggle to balance efficiency and accuracy: they often require expensive reference models and multiple forward passes, or apply static edits that risk suppressing genuine visual evidence. To address this, we introduce HulluEdit, a single-pass, reference-free intervention framework. Our core innovation is orthogonal subspace editing: we decompose the hidden states of the model into orthogonal subspaces - visual evidence, conflicting priors, and residual uncertainty - enabling selective suppression of hallucinatory patterns without interfering with visual grounding. This approach mathematically guarantees that edits applied to the prior subspace leave the visual component entirely unaffected. Extensive experiments show that HulluEdit achieves state-of-the-art hallucination reduction on benchmarks including POPE and CHAIR across diverse architectures, while preserving general capabilities on MME and maintaining efficient inference. Our method consistently outperforms contrastive decoding and static subspace editing baselines, offering a new pathway toward more trustworthy LVLMs.",

    "abstract": "Large language model (LLM) agents increasingly rely on external tools and retrieval systems to autonomously complete complex tasks. However, this design exposes agents to indirect prompt injection (IPI), where attacker-controlled context embedded in tool outputs or retrieved content silently steers agent actions away from user intent. Unlike prompt-based attacks, IPI unfolds over multi-turn trajectories, making malicious control difficult to disentangle from legitimate task execution. Existing inference-time defenses primarily rely on heuristic detection and conservative blocking of high-risk actions, which can prematurely terminate workflows or broadly suppress tool usage under ambiguous multi-turn scenarios. We propose AgentSentry, a novel inference-time detection and mitigation framework for tool-augmented LLM agents. To the best of our knowledge, AgentSentry is the first inference-time defense to model multi-turn IPI as a temporal causal takeover. It localizes takeover points via controlled counterfactual re-executions at tool-return boundaries and enables safe continuation through causally guided context purification that removes attack-induced deviations while preserving task-relevant evidence. We evaluate AgentSentry on the \\textsc{AgentDojo} benchmark across four task suites, three IPI attack families, and multiple black-box LLMs. AgentSentry eliminates successful attacks and maintains strong utility under attack, achieving an average Utility Under Attack (UA) of 74.55 %, improving UA by 20.8 to 33.6 percentage points over the strongest baselines without degrading benign performance.",

    "title": "Human Label Variation in Implicit Discourse Relation Recognition",
    "abstract": "There is growing recognition that many NLP tasks lack a single ground truth, as human judgments reflect diverse perspectives. To capture this variation, models have been developed to predict full annotation distributions rather than majority labels, while perspectivist models aim to reproduce the interpretations of individual annotators. In this work, we compare these approaches on Implicit Discourse Relation Recognition (IDRR), a highly ambiguous task where disagreement often arises from cognitive complexity rather than ideological bias. Our experiments show that existing annotator-specific models perform poorly in IDRR unless ambiguity is reduced, whereas models trained on label distributions yield more stable predictions. Further analysis indicates that frequent cognitively demanding cases drive inconsistency in human interpretation, posing challenges for perspectivist modeling in IDRR.",

    "abstract": "Table Question Answering (TQA) aims to answer natural language questions over structured tables. Large Language Models (LLMs) enable promising solutions to this problem, with operator-centric solutions that generate table manipulation pipelines in a multi-step manner offering state-of-the-art performance. However, these solutions rely on multiple LLM calls, resulting in prohibitive latencies and computational costs.   We propose Operation-R1, the first framework that trains lightweight LLMs (e.g., Qwen-4B/1.7B) via a novel variant of reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards to produce high-quality data-preparation pipelines for TQA in a single inference step. To train such an LLM, we first introduce a self-supervised rewarding mechanism to automatically obtain fine-grained pipeline-wise supervision signals for LLM training. We also propose variance-aware group resampling to mitigate training instability. To further enhance robustness of pipeline generation, we develop two complementary mechanisms: operation merge, which filters spurious operations through multi-candidate consensus, and adaptive rollback, which offers runtime protection against information loss in data transformation. Experiments on two benchmark datasets show that, with the same LLM backbone, Operation-R1 achieves average absolute accuracy gains of 9.55 and 6.08 percentage points over multi-step preparation baselines, with 79\\% table compression and a 2.2$\\times$ reduction in monetary cost.",

Despite their promise, the interpretability and steerability of modern SSMs remain relatively underexplored. We take a major step in this direction by identifying activation subspace bottlenecks in the Mamba family of SSM models using tools from mechanistic interpretability. We then introduce a test-time steering intervention that simply multiplies the activations of the identified bottlenecks by a scalar. Across 5 SSMs and 6 diverse benchmarks, this intervention improves performance by an average of 8.27%, without requiring any task-specific tuning. Finally, we validate that the identified bottlenecks are indeed hindering performance by modifying them to yield an architecture we call Stable-Mamba, which achieves long-context performance gains when retrained from scratch.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has been widely applied to Large Language Model (LLM) post-training to align model outputs with human preferences. Recent models, such as DeepSeek-R1, have also shown RLHF's potential to improve LLM reasoning on complex tasks. In RL, inference and training co-exist, creating dynamic resource demands throughout the workflow. Compared to traditional RL, RLHF further challenges training efficiency due to expanding model sizes and resource consumption. Several RLHF frameworks aim to balance flexible abstraction and efficient execution. However, they rely on serverful infrastructures, which struggle with fine-grained resource variability. As a result, during synchronous RLHF training, idle time between or within RL components often causes overhead and resource wastage.   To address these issues, we present RLHFless, the first scalable training framework for synchronous RLHF, built on serverless computing environments. RLHFless adapts to dynamic resource demands throughout the RLHF pipeline, pre-computes shared prefixes to avoid repeated computation, and uses a cost-aware actor scaling strategy that accounts for response length variation to find sweet spots with lower cost and higher speed. In addition, RLHFless assigns workloads efficiently to reduce intra-function imbalance and idle time. Experiments on both physical testbeds and a large-scale simulated cluster show that RLHFless achieves up to 1.35x speedup and 44.8% cost reduction compared to the state-of-the-art baseline.",

The proposed model reconstructs speckle-suppressed images while preserving anatomically meaningful edges and contrast. On a held-out simulated test set, our approach consistently outperforms classical filters and recent learning-based despeckling baselines.

Finally, we evaluate sensitivity to simulation probe settings and observe domain shift, motivating diversified training and adaptation for robust clinical deployment.",

However, their inherited position-dependent modeling mechanism, Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), remains suboptimal for 3D multimodal understanding. The vanilla RoPE formulation fails to preserve essential three-dimensional spatial structures when encoding 3D tokens, and its relative distance computation overlooks angular dependencies, hindering the model's ability to capture directional variations in visual representations. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Spherical Coordinate-based Positional Embedding (SoPE). Our method maps point-cloud token indices into a 3D spherical coordinate space, enabling unified modeling of spatial locations and directional angles. This formulation preserves the inherent geometric structure of point-cloud data, enhances spatial awareness, and yields more consistent and expressive geometric representations for multimodal learning. In addition, we introduce a multi-scale frequency mixing strategy to fuse feature information across different frequency domains. Experimental results on multiple 3D scene benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach, while real-world deployment experiments further demonstrate its strong generalization capability.",

First, a suitable planning model capturing the relevant aspects of the full nonlinear helicopter dynamics is derived. Next, we use the SHMPC together with a touchdown controller stage to ensure a pre-specified maneuver time and an associated landing time window despite the presence of disturbances. A high disturbance rejection performance is achieved by designing an ancillary controller with disturbance feedback. Thus, given a target position and time, a safe landing with suitable terminal conditions is be guaranteed if the initial optimization problem is feasible. The efficacy of our approach is shown in simulation where all maneuvers achieve a high landing precision in strong winds while satisfying timing and operational constraints with maximum computation times in the millisecond range.",

Beyond finite automata, we outline how opacity has been studied in richer models such as stochastic systems, timed systems, Petri nets, and continuous/hybrid dynamics, and we briefly survey applications in robotics, location privacy, and information services.

By combining the DAttention and AIFI modules, the model flexibly models multi-scale spatial relationships, improving multi-scale target detection performance. Additionally, the DynFreq-C3 module is proposed to enhance small target detection capability through cross-space frequency feature enhancement.

Audio preferences prove as reliable as text, with inter-rater agreement reaching good levels (ICC(2,k) $\\approx$ .80) at $\\sim$9 raters -- the first ICC-based reliability characterization in the preference annotation literature for either modality.

Synthetic ratings further align with human judgments and predict inter-rater agreement, supporting their use both for triaging ambiguous pairs and as full replacements for human annotations.",

The planning layer adopts a hierarchical on-demand strategy: the Proximal Planner generates smooth, high-frequency local trajectories, while the Region-Sequence Planner is activated only when necessary to optimize global visitation order. Comparative evaluations in simulation demonstrate that SCOPE achieves competitive exploration performance comparable to state-of-the-art global planners, while reducing computational cost by an average of 86.9%.

    "abstract": "Vision-language models (VLMs) often struggle with geometric reasoning due to their limited perception of fundamental diagram elements. To tackle this challenge, we introduce GeoPerceive, a benchmark comprising diagram instances paired with domain-specific language (DSL) representations, along with an efficient automatic data generation pipeline. This design enables the isolated evaluation of geometric perception independently from reasoning. To exploit the data provided by GeoPerceive for enhancing the geometric perception capabilities of VLMs, we propose GeoDPO, a translator-guided reinforcement learning (RL) framework. GeoDPO employs an NL-to-DSL translator, which is trained on synthetic pairs generated by the data engine of GeoPerceive, to bridge natural language and DSL. This translator facilitates the computation of fine-grained, DSL-level scores, which serve as reward signals in reinforcement learning. We assess GeoDPO on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, spanning tasks in geometric perception as well as downstream reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that, while supervised fine-tuning (SFT) offers only marginal improvements and may even impair performance in out-of-domain scenarios, GeoDPO achieves substantial gains: $+26.5\\%$ on in-domain data, $+8.0\\%$ on out-of-domain data, and $+39.0\\%$ on downstream reasoning tasks. These findings underscore the superior performance and generalization ability of GeoDPO over SFT. All codes are released at https://github.com/Longin-Yu/GeoPerceive   to ensure reproducibility.",

    "abstract": "Existing neural network calibration methods often treat calibration as a static, post-hoc optimization task. However, this neglects the dynamic and temporal nature of real-world inference. Moreover, existing methods do not provide an intuitive interface enabling human operators to dynamically adjust model behavior under shifting conditions. In this work, we propose Knob, a framework that connects deep learning with classical control theory by mapping neural gating dynamics to a second-order mechanical system. By establishing correspondences between physical parameters -- damping ratio ($ζ$) and natural frequency ($ω_n$) -- and neural gating, we create a tunable \"safety valve\". The core mechanism employs a logit-level convex fusion, functioning as an input-adaptive temperature scaling. It tends to reduce model confidence particularly when model branches produce conflicting predictions. Furthermore, by imposing second-order dynamics (Knob-ODE), we enable a \\textit{dual-mode} inference: standard i.i.d. processing for static tasks, and state-preserving processing for continuous streams. Our framework allows operators to tune \"stability\" and \"sensitivity\" through familiar physical analogues. This paper presents an exploratory architectural interface; we focus on demonstrating the concept and validating its control-theoretic properties rather than claiming state-of-the-art calibration performance. Experiments on CIFAR-10-C validate the calibration mechanism and demonstrate that, in Continuous Mode, the gate responses are consistent with standard second-order control signatures (step settling and low-pass attenuation), paving the way for predictable human-in-the-loop tuning.",

In the experiments, our fine-tuned network achieves high recognition rates with only a small amount of data (e.g., 0.1% of the training data), significantly enhancing its practicality in real-world (or private) scenarios where only limited data is available.

    "title": "Tokenization, Fusion and Decoupling: Bridging the Granularity Mismatch Between Large Language Models and Knowledge Graphs",
    "abstract": "Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) is promising but hindered by a fundamental granularity mismatch. LLMs operate on fragmented token sequences, whereas entities are the fundamental units in knowledge graphs (KGs) scenarios. Existing approaches typically constrain predictions to limited candidate sets or align entities with the LLM's vocabulary by pooling multiple tokens or decomposing entities into fixed-length token sequences, which fail to capture both the semantic meaning of the text and the structural integrity of the graph. To address this, we propose KGT, a novel framework that uses dedicated entity tokens to enable efficient, full-space prediction. Specifically, we first introduce specialized tokenization to construct feature representations at the level of dedicated entity tokens. We then fuse pre-trained structural and textual features into these unified embeddings via a relation-guided gating mechanism, avoiding training from scratch. Finally, we implement decoupled prediction by leveraging independent heads to separate and combine semantic and structural reasoning. Experimental results show that KGT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks.",

    "abstract": "The rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has accelerated the transition from conversational chatbots to general agents. However, effectively balancing empathetic communication with budget-aware decision-making remains an open challenge. Since existing methods fail to capture these complex strategic trade-offs, we propose InteractCS-RL, a framework that reframes task-oriented dialogue as a multi-granularity reinforcement learning process. Specifically, we first establish a User-centric Interaction Framework to provide a high-fidelity training gym, enabling agents to dynamically explore diverse strategies with persona-driven users. Then, we introduce Cost-aware Multi-turn Policy Optimization (CMPO) with a hybrid advantage estimation strategy. By integrating generative process credits and employing a PID-Lagrangian cost controller, CMPO effectively guides the policy to explore Pareto boundary between user reward and global cost constraints. Extensive experiments on customized real business scenarios demonstrate that InteractCS-RL significantly outperform other baselines across three evaluation dimensions. Further evaluation on tool-agent-user interaction benchmarks verify InteractCS-RL robustness across diverse domains.",

We applied a cross-disciplinary approach to develop a framework for designing persuasive dialogue agents that draws on proven strategies from social psychology, behavioral economics, and communication theory. We validated our proposed framework through experiments on two distinct datasets: the Persuasion for Good dataset, which represents a specific in-domain scenario, and the DailyPersuasion dataset, which encompasses a wide range of scenarios. The proposed framework achieved strong results for both datasets and demonstrated notable improvement in the persuasion success rate as well as promising generalizability. Notably, the proposed framework also excelled at persuading individuals with initially low intent, which addresses a critical challenge for persuasive dialogue agents.",

However, they often struggle with (1) semantic understanding gap between the features of pre-trained models and those of reflection removal models, and (2) reflection label inconsistencies between synthetic and real-world training data. In this work, we first adopt the parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategy by integrating several learnable Mona layers into the pre-trained model to align the training directions. Then, a label generator is designed to unify the reflection labels for both synthetic and real-world data. In addition, a Gaussian-based Adaptive Frequency Learning Block (G-AFLB) is proposed to adaptively learn and fuse the frequency priors, and a Dynamic Agent Attention (DAA) is employed as an alternative to window-based attention by dynamically modeling the significance levels across windows (inter-) and within an individual window (intra-). These components constitute our proposed Gap-Free Reflection Removal Network (GFRRN). Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our GFRRN, achieving superior performance against state-of-the-art SIRR methods.",

    "abstract": "Latent diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in high-fidelity text-to-image generation, but their tendency to memorize training data raises critical privacy and intellectual property concerns. Membership inference attacks (MIAs) provide a principled way to audit such memorization by determining whether a given sample was included in training. However, existing approaches assume access to ground-truth captions. This assumption fails in realistic scenarios where only images are available and their textual annotations remain undisclosed, rendering prior methods ineffective when substituted with vision-language model (VLM) captions. In this work, we propose MoFit, a caption-free MIA framework that constructs synthetic conditioning inputs that are explicitly overfitted to the target model's generative manifold. Given a query image, MoFit proceeds in two stages: (i) model-fitted surrogate optimization, where a perturbation applied to the image is optimized to construct a surrogate in regions of the model's unconditional prior learned from member samples, and (ii) surrogate-driven embedding extraction, where a model-fitted embedding is derived from the surrogate and then used as a mismatched condition for the query image. This embedding amplifies conditional loss responses for member samples while leaving hold-outs relatively less affected, thereby enhancing separability in the absence of ground-truth captions. Our comprehensive experiments across multiple datasets and diffusion models demonstrate that MoFit consistently outperforms prior VLM-conditioned baselines and achieves performance competitive with caption-dependent methods.",

    "abstract": "Intermittent demand, a pattern characterized by long sequences of zero sales punctuated by sporadic, non-zero values, poses a persistent challenge in retail and supply chain forecasting. Both traditional methods, such as ARIMA, exponential smoothing, or Croston variants, as well as modern neural architectures such as DeepAR and Transformer-based models often underperform on such data, as they treat demand as a single continuous process or become computationally expensive when scaled across many sparse series. To address these limitations, we introduce Switch-Hurdle: a new framework that integrates a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) encoder with a Hurdle-based probabilistic decoder. The encoder uses a sparse Top-1 expert routing during the forward pass yet approximately dense in the backward pass via a straight-through estimator (STE). The decoder follows a cross-attention autoregressive design with a shared hurdle head that explicitly separates the forecasting task into two components: a binary classification component estimating the probability of a sale, and a conditional regression component, predicting the quantity given a sale. This structured separation enables the model to capture both occurrence and magnitude processes inherent to intermittent demand. Empirical results on the M5 benchmark and a large proprietary retail dataset show that Switch-Hurdle achieves state-of-the-art prediction performance while maintaining scalability.",

    "abstract": "The rapid advancement of AI-powered smart glasses, one of the hottest wearable devices, has unlocked new frontiers for multimodal interaction, with Visual Question Answering (VQA) over external knowledge sources emerging as a core application. Existing Vision Language Models (VLMs) adapted to smart glasses are typically trained and evaluated on traditional multimodal datasets; however, these datasets lack the variety and realism needed to reflect smart glasses usage scenarios and diverge from their specific challenges, where accurately identifying the object of interest must precede any external knowledge retrieval. To bridge this gap, we introduce SUPERGLASSES, the first comprehensive VQA benchmark built on real-world data entirely collected by smart glasses devices. SUPERGLASSES comprises 2,422 egocentric image-question pairs spanning 14 image domains and 8 query categories, enriched with full search trajectories and reasoning annotations. We evaluate 26 representative VLMs on this benchmark, revealing significant performance gaps. To address the limitations of existing models, we further propose SUPERLENS, a multimodal smart glasses agent that enables retrieval-augmented answer generation by integrating automatic object detection, query decoupling, and multimodal web search. Our agent achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing GPT-4o by 2.19 percent, and highlights the need for task-specific solutions in smart glasses VQA scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Pre-training Large Language Models requires immense computational resources, making optimizer efficiency essential. The optimization landscape is highly anisotropic, with loss reduction driven predominantly by progress along flat directions. While matrix-based optimizers such as Muon and SOAP leverage fine-grained curvature information to outperform AdamW, their updates tend toward isotropy -- relatively conservative along flat directions yet potentially aggressive along sharp ones. To address this limitation, we first establish a unified Riemannian Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) framework that elucidates how common adaptive algorithms operate synergistically: the preconditioner induces a Riemannian geometry that mitigates ill-conditioning, while momentum serves as a Riemannian damping term that promotes convergence. Guided by these insights, we propose LITE, a generalized acceleration strategy that enhances training dynamics by applying larger Hessian damping coefficients and learning rates along flat trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LITE significantly accelerates both Muon and SOAP across diverse architectures (Dense, MoE), parameter scales (130M--1.3B), datasets (C4, Pile), and learning-rate schedules (cosine, warmup-stable-decay). Theoretical analysis confirms that LITE facilitates faster convergence along flat directions in anisotropic landscapes, providing a principled approach to efficient LLM pre-training.

    "abstract": "Large language models have enabled agents that reason, plan, and interact with tools and environments to accomplish complex tasks. As these agents operate over extended interaction horizons, their effectiveness increasingly depends on adapting behavior to individual users and maintaining continuity across time, giving rise to personalized LLM-powered agents. In such long-term, user-dependent settings, personalization permeates the entire decision pipeline rather than remaining confined to surface-level generation. This survey provides a capability-oriented review of personalized LLM-powered agents. We organize the literature around four interdependent components: profile modeling, memory, planning, and action execution. Using this taxonomy, we synthesize representative methods and analyze how user signals are represented, propagated, and utilized, highlighting cross-component interactions and recurring design trade-offs. We further examine evaluation metrics and benchmarks tailored to personalized agents, summarize application scenarios spanning general assistance to specialized domains, and outline future directions for research and deployment. By offering a structured framework for understanding and designing personalized LLM-powered agents, this survey charts a roadmap toward more user-aligned, adaptive, robust, and deployable agentic systems, accelerating progress from prototype personalization to scalable real-world assistants.",

This work introduces ViCLIP-OT, a foundation vision-language model specifically designed for Vietnamese image-text retrieval. The proposed framework integrates CLIP-style contrastive learning with a Similarity-Graph Regularized Optimal Transport (SIGROT) loss to enhance global cross-modal consistency and mitigate modality gap issues. Extensive experiments on three Vietnamese benchmarks (UITOpenViIC, KTVIC, and Crossmodal-3600) demonstrate that ViCLIP-OT consistently outperforms CLIP and SigLIP baselines in both in-domain and zero-shot settings. On UIT-OpenViIC, the model achieves an average Recall@K of 67.34%, improving upon CLIP by 5.75 percentage points. In zero-shot evaluation on Crossmodal-3600, ViCLIPOT surpasses CLIP by 11.72 percentage points. Embedding-space analysis further confirms improved alignment and reduced modality gap. The results indicate that integrating SIGROT provides an effective and scalable strategy for cross-modal retrieval in low-resource languages, offering practical implications for intelligent multimedia retrieval systems in Vietnamese and other underrepresented linguistic contexts.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a growing global crisis projected to cause 10 million deaths per year by 2050. While the WHO Global Antimicrobial Resistance and Use Surveillance System (GLASS) provides standardized surveillance data across 44 countries, few studies have applied machine learning to forecast population-level resistance trends from this data. This paper presents a two-component framework for AMR trend forecasting and evidence-grounded policy decision support. We benchmark six models -- Naive, Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, XGBoost, LightGBM, and LSTM -- on 5,909 WHO GLASS observations across six WHO regions (2021-2023). XGBoost achieved the best performance with a test MAE of 7.07% and R-squared of 0.854, outperforming the naive baseline by 83.1%. Feature importance analysis identified the prior-year resistance rate as the dominant predictor (50.5% importance), while regional MAE ranged from 4.16% (European Region) to 10.14% (South-East Asia Region). We additionally implemented a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline combining a ChromaDB vector store of WHO policy documents with a locally deployed Phi-3 Mini language model, producing source-attributed, hallucination-constrained policy answers.

    "abstract": "Carsickness has gained significant attention with the rise of automated vehicles, prompting extensive research across on-road, test-track, and driving simulator environments to understand its occurrence and develop mitigation strategies. However, the lack of carsickness standardization complicates comparisons across studies and environments. Previous works demonstrate measurement validity between two setups at most (e.g., on-road vs. driving simulator), leaving gaps in multi-environment comparisons. This study investigates the recreation of an on-road motion sickness exposure - previously replicated on a test track - using a motion-based driving simulator. Twenty-eight participants performed an eyes-off-road non-driving task while reporting motion sickness using the Misery Scale during the experiment and the Motion Sickness Assessment Questionnaire afterward. Psychological factors known to influence motion sickness were also assessed. The results present subjective and objective measurements for motion sickness across the considered environments. In this paper, acceleration measurements, objective metrics and subjective motion sickness ratings across environments are compared, highlighting key differences in sickness occurrence for simulator-based research validity. Significantly lower motion sickness scores are reported in the simulator compared to on-road and test-track conditions, due to its limited working envelope to reproduce low-frequency (<0.5 Hz) motions, which are the most provocative for motion sickness.",

    "abstract": "Open-vocabulary 3D occupancy is vital for embodied agents, which need to understand complex indoor environments where semantic categories are abundant and evolve beyond fixed taxonomies. While recent work has explored open-vocabulary occupancy in outdoor driving scenarios, such methods transfer poorly indoors, where geometry is denser, layouts are more intricate, and semantics are far more fine-grained. To address these challenges, we adopt a geometry-only supervision paradigm that uses only binary occupancy labels (occupied vs free). Our framework builds upon 3D Language-Embedded Gaussians, which serve as a unified intermediate representation coupling fine-grained 3D geometry with a language-aligned semantic embedding. On the geometry side, we find that existing Gaussian-to-Occupancy operators fail to converge under such weak supervision, and we introduce an opacity-aware, Poisson-based approach that stabilizes volumetric aggregation. On the semantic side, direct alignment between rendered features and open-vocabulary segmentation features suffers from feature mixing; we therefore propose a Progressive Temperature Decay schedule that gradually sharpens opacities during splatting, strengthening Gaussian-language alignment. On Occ-ScanNet, our framework achieves 59.50 IoU and 21.05 mIoU in the open-vocabulary setting, surpassing all existing occupancy methods in IoU and outperforming prior open-vocabulary approaches by a large margin in mIoU.

    "abstract": "Reconstructing articulated objects into high-fidelity digital twins is crucial for applications such as robotic manipulation and interactive simulation. Recent self-supervised methods using differentiable rendering frameworks like 3D Gaussian Splatting remain highly sensitive to the initial part segmentation. Their reliance on heuristic clustering or pre-trained models often causes optimization to converge to local minima, especially for complex multi-part objects. To address these limitations, we propose ArtPro, a novel self-supervised framework that introduces adaptive integration of mobility proposals. Our approach begins with an over-segmentation initialization guided by geometry features and motion priors, generating part proposals with plausible motion hypotheses. During optimization, we dynamically merge these proposals by analyzing motion consistency among spatial neighbors, while a collision-aware motion pruning mechanism prevents erroneous kinematic estimation. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world objects demonstrate that ArtPro achieves robust reconstruction of complex multi-part objects, significantly outperforming existing methods in accuracy and stability.",

    "abstract": "Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a generalist robotic agent. However, existing VLAs are hindered by excessive parameter scales, prohibitive pre-training requirements, and limited applicability to diverse embodiments. To improve the practicality of VLAs, we propose a comprehensive benchmark and an improved baseline. First, we propose CEBench, a new benchmark spanning diverse embodiments in both simulation and the real world with consideration of domain randomization. We collect 14.4k simulated trajectories and 1.6k real-world expert-curated trajectories to support training on CEBench. Second, using CEBench as our testbed, we study three critical aspects of VLAs' practicality and offer several key findings. Informed by these findings, we introduce LLaVA-VLA, a lightweight yet powerful VLA designed for practical deployment on consumer-grade GPUs. Architecturally, it integrates a compact VLM backbone with multi-view perception, proprioceptive tokenization, and action chunking. To eliminate reliance on costly pre-training, LLaVA-VLA adopts a two-stage training paradigm including post-training and fine-tuning. Furthermore, LLaVA-VLA extends the action space to unify navigation and manipulation. Experiments across embodiments demonstrate the capabilities of generalization and versatility of LLaVA-VLA , while real-world mobile manipulation experiments establish it as the first end-to-end VLA model for mobile manipulation. We will open-source all datasets, codes, and checkpoints upon acceptance to foster reproducibility and future research.",

    "abstract": "Although diffusion language models (DLMs) are evolving quickly, many recent models converge on a set of shared components. These components, however, are distributed across ad-hoc research codebases or lack transparent implementations, making them difficult to reproduce or extend. As the field accelerates, there is a clear need for a unified framework that standardizes these common components while remaining flexible enough to support new methods and architectures.   To address this gap, we introduce dLLM, an open-source framework that unifies the core components of diffusion language modeling -- training, inference, and evaluation -- and makes them easy to customize for new designs. With dLLM, users can reproduce, finetune, deploy, and evaluate open-source large DLMs such as LLaDA and Dream through a standardized pipeline. The framework also provides minimal, reproducible recipes for building small DLMs from scratch with accessible compute, including converting any BERT-style encoder or autoregressive LM into a DLM. We also release the checkpoints of these small DLMs to make DLMs more accessible and accelerate future research.",

    "title": "LEDA: Latent Semantic Distribution Alignment for Multi-domain Graph Pre-training",
    "abstract": "Recent advances in generic large models, such as GPT and DeepSeek, have motivated the introduction of universality to graph pre-training, aiming to learn rich and generalizable knowledge across diverse domains using graph representations to improve performance in various downstream applications. However, most existing methods face challenges in learning effective knowledge from generic graphs, primarily due to simplistic data alignment and limited training guidance. The issue of simplistic data alignment arises from the use of a straightforward unification for highly diverse graph data, which fails to align semantics and misleads pre-training models. The problem with limited training guidance lies in the arbitrary application of in-domain pre-training paradigms to cross-domain scenarios. While it is effective in enhancing discriminative representation in one data space, it struggles to capture effective knowledge from many graphs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Latent sEmantic Distribution Alignment (LEDA) model for universal graph pre-training. Specifically, we first introduce a dimension projection unit to adaptively align diverse domain features into a shared semantic space with minimal information loss. Furthermore, we design a variational semantic inference module to obtain the shared latent distribution. The distribution is then adopted to guide the domain projection, aligning it with shared semantics across domains and ensuring cross-domain semantic learning. LEDA exhibits strong performance across a broad range of graphs and downstream tasks. Remarkably, in few-shot cross-domain settings, it significantly outperforms in-domain baselines and advanced universal pre-training models.",

These shortcomings provide limited support for model development and multimodal perception research. We propose a practical approach for AVQA dataset construction. First, we design a crowdsourced subjective experiment framework for AVQA, breaks the constraints of in-lab settings and achieves reliable annotation across varied environments. Second, a systematic data preparation strategy is further employed to ensure broad coverage of both quality levels and semantic scenarios. Third, we extend the dataset with additional annotations, enabling research on multimodal perception mechanisms and their relation to content.

We further investigate using partially vocoded utterances as the fine-tuning data, thereby reducing the cost of data collection. Our experiments demonstrate that, on in-domain test data, the fine-tuned Whisper yields low synthetic-word detection error rates and transcription error rates.

    "title": "Denoising as Path Planning: Training-Free Acceleration of Diffusion Models with DPCache",
    "abstract": "Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in image and video generation, yet their practical deployment remains hindered by the substantial computational overhead of multi-step iterative sampling. Among acceleration strategies, caching-based methods offer a training-free and effective solution by reusing or predicting features across timesteps. However, existing approaches rely on fixed or locally adaptive schedules without considering the global structure of the denoising trajectory, often leading to error accumulation and visual artifacts. To overcome this limitation, we propose DPCache, a novel training-free acceleration framework that formulates diffusion sampling acceleration as a global path planning problem. DPCache constructs a Path-Aware Cost Tensor from a small calibration set to quantify the path-dependent error of skipping timesteps conditioned on the preceding key timestep. Leveraging this tensor, DPCache employs dynamic programming to select an optimal sequence of key timesteps that minimizes the total path cost while preserving trajectory fidelity. During inference, the model performs full computations only at these key timesteps, while intermediate outputs are efficiently predicted using cached features. Extensive experiments on DiT, FLUX, and HunyuanVideo demonstrate that DPCache achieves strong acceleration with minimal quality loss, outperforming prior acceleration methods by $+$0.031 ImageReward at 4.87$\\times$ speedup and even surpassing the full-step baseline by $+$0.028 ImageReward at 3.54$\\times$ speedup on FLUX, validating the effectiveness of our path-aware global scheduling framework.

    "abstract": "In online advertising, the inherent complexity and dynamic nature of advertising environments necessitate the use of auto-bidding services to assist advertisers in bid optimization. This complexity is further compounded in multi-channel scenarios, where effective allocation of budgets and constraints across channels with distinct behavioral patterns becomes critical for optimizing return on investment. Current approaches predominantly rely on either optimization-based strategies or reinforcement learning techniques. However, optimization-based methods lack flexibility in adapting to dynamic market conditions, while reinforcement learning approaches often struggle to capture essential historical dependencies and observational patterns within the constraints of Markov Decision Process frameworks. To address these limitations, we propose AHBid, an Adaptable Hierarchical Bidding framework that integrates generative planning with real-time control. The framework employs a high-level generative planner based on diffusion models to dynamically allocate budgets and constraints by effectively capturing historical context and temporal patterns. We introduce a constraint enforcement mechanism to ensure compliance with specified constraints, along with a trajectory refinement mechanism that enhances adaptability to environmental changes through the utilization of historical data. The system further incorporates a control-based bidding algorithm that synergistically combines historical knowledge with real-time information, significantly improving both adaptability and operational efficacy. Extensive experiments conducted on large-scale offline datasets and through online A/B tests demonstrate the effectiveness of AHBid, yielding a 13.57% increase in overall return compared to existing baselines.",

    "abstract": "Interactive Medical-SAM2 GUI is an open-source desktop application for semi-automatic annotation of 2D and 3D medical images. Built on the Napari multi-dimensional viewer, box/point prompting is integrated with SAM2-style propagation by treating a 3D volume as a slice sequence, enabling mask propagation from sparse prompts using Medical-SAM2 on top of SAM2. Voxel-level annotation remains essential for developing and validating medical imaging algorithms, yet manual labeling is slow and expensive for 3D scans, and existing integrations frequently emphasize per-slice interaction without providing a unified, cohort-oriented workflow for navigation, propagation, interactive correction, and quantitative export in a single local pipeline. To address this practical limitation, a local-first Napari workflow is provided for efficient 3D annotation across multiple studies using standard DICOM series and/or NIfTI volumes. Users can annotate cases sequentially under a single root folder with explicit proceed/skip actions, initialize objects via box-first prompting (including first/last-slice initialization for single-object propagation), refine predictions with point prompts, and finalize labels through prompt-first correction prior to saving. During export, per-object volumetry and 3D volume rendering are supported, and image geometry is preserved via SimpleITK. The GUI is implemented in Python using Napari and PyTorch, with optional N4 bias-field correction, and is intended exclusively for research annotation workflows.

    "abstract": "Generative retrieval has emerged as a powerful paradigm for LLM-based recommendation. However, industrial recommender systems often benefit from restricting the output space to a constrained subset of items based on business logic (e.g. enforcing content freshness or product category), which standard autoregressive decoding cannot natively support. Moreover, existing constrained decoding methods that make use of prefix trees (Tries) incur severe latency penalties on hardware accelerators (TPUs/GPUs). In this work, we introduce STATIC (Sparse Transition Matrix-Accelerated Trie Index for Constrained Decoding), an efficient and scalable constrained decoding technique designed specifically for high-throughput LLM-based generative retrieval on TPUs/GPUs. By flattening the prefix tree into a static Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) matrix, we transform irregular tree traversals into fully vectorized sparse matrix operations, unlocking massive efficiency gains on hardware accelerators. We deploy STATIC on a large-scale industrial video recommendation platform serving billions of users. STATIC produces significant product metric impact with minimal latency overhead (0.033 ms per step and 0.25% of inference time), achieving a 948x speedup over a CPU trie implementation and a 47-1033x speedup over a hardware-accelerated binary-search baseline. Furthermore, the runtime overhead of STATIC remains extremely low across a wide range of practical configurations. To the best of our knowledge, STATIC enables the first production-scale deployment of strictly constrained generative retrieval. In addition, evaluation on academic benchmarks demonstrates that STATIC can considerably improve cold-start performance for generative retrieval.

    "abstract": "Universal graph pre-training has emerged as a key paradigm in graph representation learning, offering a promising way to train encoders to learn transferable representations from unlabeled graphs and to effectively generalize across a wide range of downstream tasks. However, recent explorations in universal graph pre-training primarily focus on homogeneous graphs and it remains unexplored for heterogeneous graphs, which exhibit greater structural and semantic complexity. This heterogeneity makes it highly challenging to train a universal encoder for diverse heterogeneous graphs: (i) the diverse types with dataset-specific semantics hinder the construction of a unified representation space; (ii) the number and semantics of meta-paths vary across datasets, making encoding and aggregation patterns learned from one dataset difficult to apply to others. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Meta-path-aware Universal heterogeneous Graph pre-training (MUG) approach. Specifically, for challenge (i), MUG introduces a input unification module that integrates information from multiple node and relation types within each heterogeneous graph into a unified representation.This representation is then projected into a shared space by a dimension-aware encoder, enabling alignment across graphs with diverse schemas.Furthermore, for challenge (ii), MUG trains a shared encoder to capture consistent structural patterns across diverse meta-path views rather than relying on dataset-specific aggregation strategies, while a global objective encourages discriminability and reduces dataset-specific biases. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of MUG on some real datasets.",

    "abstract": "Missing modalities present a fundamental challenge in multimodal models, often causing catastrophic performance degradation. Our observations suggest that this fragility stems from an imbalanced learning process, where the model develops an implicit preference for certain modalities, leading to the under-optimization of others. We propose a simple yet efficient method to address this challenge. The central insight of our work is that the dominance relationship between modalities can be effectively discerned and quantified in the frequency domain. To leverage this principle, we first introduce a Frequency Ratio Metric (FRM) to quantify modality preference by analyzing features in the frequency domain. Guided by FRM, we then propose a Multimodal Weight Allocation Module, a plug-and-play component that dynamically re-balances the contribution of each branch during training, promoting a more holistic learning paradigm. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MWAM can be seamlessly integrated into diverse architectural backbones, such as those based on CNNs and ViTs. Furthermore, MWAM delivers consistent performance gains across a wide range of tasks and modality combinations. This advancement extends beyond merely optimizing the performance of the base model; it also manifests as further performance improvements to state-of-the-art methods addressing the missing modality problem.",

    "abstract": "Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has substantially empowered Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle complex reasoning tasks, yet the verbose nature of explicit reasoning steps incurs prohibitive inference latency and computational costs, limiting real-world deployment. While existing compression methods - ranging from self-training to Reinforcement Learning (RL) with length constraints - attempt to mitigate this, they often sacrifice reasoning capability for brevity. We identify a critical failure mode in these approaches: explicitly optimizing for shorter trajectories triggers rapid entropy collapse, which prematurely shrinks the exploration space and stifles the discovery of valid reasoning paths, particularly for challenging questions requiring extensive deduction. To address this issue, we propose Compress responses for Easy questions and Explore Hard ones (CEEH), a difficulty-aware approach to RL-based efficient reasoning. CEEH dynamically assesses instance difficulty to apply selective entropy regularization: it preserves a diverse search space for currently hard questions to ensure robustness, while permitting aggressive compression on easier instances where the reasoning path is well-established. In addition, we introduce a dynamic optimal-length penalty anchored to the historically shortest correct response, which effectively counteracts entropy-induced length inflation and stabilizes the reward signal. Across six reasoning benchmarks, CEEH consistently reduces response length while maintaining accuracy comparable to the base model, and improves Pass@k relative to length-only optimization.",

We form the block quadrifocal tensor and show that it admits a Tucker decomposition whose factor matrices are the stacked camera matrices, and which thus has a multilinear rank of (4,~4,~4,~4) independent of $n$. We develop the first synchronization algorithm for quadrifocal tensors, using Tucker decomposition, alternating direction method of multipliers, and iteratively reweighted least squares. We further establish relationships between the block quadrifocal, trifocal, and bifocal tensors, and introduce an algorithm that jointly synchronizes these three entities.

In this study, we introduce MobilityBench, a scalable benchmark for evaluating LLM-based route-planning agents in real-world mobility scenarios. MobilityBench is constructed from large-scale, anonymized real user queries collected from Amap and covers a broad spectrum of route-planning intents across multiple cities worldwide. To enable reproducible, end-to-end evaluation, we design a deterministic API-replay sandbox that eliminates environmental variance from live services. We further propose a multi-dimensional evaluation protocol centered on outcome validity, complemented by assessments of instruction understanding, planning, tool use, and efficiency. Using MobilityBench, we evaluate multiple LLM-based route-planning agents across diverse real-world mobility scenarios and provide an in-depth analysis of their behaviors and performance. Our findings reveal that current models perform competently on Basic information retrieval and Route Planning tasks, yet struggle considerably with Preference-Constrained Route Planning, underscoring significant room for improvement in personalized mobility applications. We publicly release the benchmark data, evaluation toolkit, and documentation at https://github.com/AMAP-ML/MobilityBench .",

    "abstract": "Differentially private federated learning (DP-FL) enables clients to collaboratively train machine learning models while preserving the privacy of their local data. However, most existing DP-FL approaches assume that all clients share a uniform privacy budget, an assumption that does not hold in real-world scenarios where privacy requirements vary widely. This privacy heterogeneity poses a significant challenge: conventional client selection strategies, which typically rely on data quantity, cannot distinguish between clients providing high-quality updates and those introducing substantial noise due to strict privacy constraints. To address this gap, we present the first systematic study of privacy-aware client selection in DP-FL. We establish a theoretical foundation by deriving a convergence analysis that quantifies the impact of privacy heterogeneity on training error. Building on this analysis, we propose a privacy-aware client selection strategy, formulated as a convex optimization problem, that adaptively adjusts selection probabilities to minimize training error. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves up to a 10% improvement in test accuracy on CIFAR-10 compared to existing baselines under heterogeneous privacy budgets. These results highlight the importance of incorporating privacy heterogeneity into client selection for practical and effective federated learning.",

    "title": "Fine-grained Semantics Integration for Large Language Model-based Recommendation",
    "abstract": "Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shifted in recommendation systems from the discriminative paradigm to the LLM-based generative paradigm, where the recommender autoregressively generates sequences of semantic identifiers (SIDs) for target items conditioned on historical interaction. While prevalent LLM-based recommenders have demonstrated performance gains by aligning pretrained LLMs between the language space and the SID space, modeling the SID space still faces two fundamental challenges: (1) Semantically Meaningless Initialization: SID tokens are randomly initialized, severing the semantic linkage between the SID space and the pretrained language space at start point, and (2) Coarse-grained Alignment: existing SFT-based alignment tasks primarily focus on item-level optimization, while overlooking the semantics of individual tokens within SID sequences.To address these challenges, we propose TS-Rec, which can integrate Token-level Semantics into LLM-based Recommenders. Specifically, TS-Rec comprises two key components: (1) Semantic-Aware embedding Initialization (SA-Init), which initializes SID token embeddings by applying mean pooling to the pretrained embeddings of keywords extracted by a teacher model; and (2) Token-level Semantic Alignment (TS-Align), which aligns individual tokens within the SID sequence with the shared semantics of the corresponding item clusters. Extensive experiments on two real-world benchmarks demonstrate that TS-Rec consistently outperforms traditional and generative baselines across all standard metrics. The results demonstrate that integrating fine-grained semantic information significantly enhances the performance of LLM-based generative recommenders.",

    "abstract": "Neural networks are increasingly deployed in safety- and mission-critical pipelines, yet many verification and analysis results are produced outside the programming environment that defines and runs the model. This separation creates a semantic gap between the executed network and the analyzed artifact, so guarantees can hinge on implicit conventions such as operator semantics, tensor layouts, preprocessing, and floating-point corner cases. We introduce TorchLean, a framework in the Lean 4 theorem prover that treats learned models as first-class mathematical objects with a single, precise semantics shared by execution and verification. TorchLean unifies (1) a PyTorch-style verified API with eager and compiled modes that lower to a shared op-tagged SSA/DAG computation-graph IR, (2) explicit Float32 semantics via an executable IEEE-754 binary32 kernel and proof-relevant rounding models, and (3) verification via IBP and CROWN/LiRPA-style bound propagation with certificate checking. We validate TorchLean end-to-end on certified robustness, physics-informed residual bounds for PINNs, and Lyapunov-style neural controller verification, alongside mechanized theoretical results including a universal approximation theorem. These results demonstrate a semantics-first infrastructure for fully formal, end-to-end verification of learning-enabled systems.",

    "abstract": "This paper proposes HyperKKL, a novel learning approach for designing Kazantzis-Kravaris/Luenberger (KKL) observers for non-autonomous nonlinear systems. While KKL observers offer a rigorous theoretical framework by immersing nonlinear dynamics into a stable linear latent space, its practical realization relies on solving Partial Differential Equations (PDE) that are analytically intractable. Current existing learning-based approximations of the KKL observer are mostly designed for autonomous systems, failing to generalize to driven dynamics without expensive retraining or online gradient updates. HyperKKL addresses this by employing a hypernetwork architecture that encodes the exogenous input signal to instantaneously generate the parameters of the KKL observer, effectively learning a family of immersion maps parameterized by the external drive. We rigorously evaluate this approach against a curriculum learning strategy that attempts to generalize from autonomous regimes via training heuristics alone. The novel approach is illustrated on four numerical simulations in benchmark examples including the Duffing, Van der Pol, Lorenz, and Rössler systems.",

In contrast, human assembly naturally couples structural reasoning with holistic shape inference. Inspired by this intuition, we reformulate 3D assembly as a joint problem of assembly and generation. We show that these two processes are mutually reinforcing: assembly provides part-level structural priors for generation, while generation injects holistic shape context that resolves ambiguities in assembly. Unlike prior methods that cannot synthesize missing geometry, we propose CRAG, which simultaneously generates plausible complete shapes and predicts poses for input parts. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across in-the-wild objects with diverse geometries, varying part counts, and missing pieces. Our code and models will be released.",

    "abstract": "Robots are increasingly entering the daily lives of families, yet their successful integration into domestic life remains a challenge. We explore family routines as a critical entry point for understanding how robots might find a sustainable role in everyday family settings. Together with each of the ten families, we co-designed robot interactions and behaviors, and a plan for the robot to support their chosen routines, accounting for contextual factors such as timing, participants, locations, and the activities in the environment. We then designed, prototyped, and deployed a mobile social robot as a four-day, in-home user study. Families welcomed the robot's reminders, with parents especially appreciating the offloading of some reminding tasks. At the same time, interviews revealed tensions around timing, authority, and family dynamics, highlighting the complexity of integrating robots into households beyond the immediate task of reminders. Based on these insights, we offer design implications for robot-facilitated contextual reminders and discuss broader considerations for designing robots for family settings.",

This system can, for example, optimize the position, rotation, scale, color, and opacity of thousands of bitmap primitives all in under 1 min using a consumer GPU. We employ and validate several techniques to facilitate the optimization: soft rasterization via Gaussian blur, structure-aware initialization, noisy canvas, and specialized losses/heuristics for videos or spatially constrained images. We demonstrate DiffBMP is not just an isolated tool, but a practical one designed to integrate into creative workflows. It supports exporting compositions to a native, layered file format, and the entire framework is publicly accessible via an easy-to-hack Python package.",

    "abstract": "Editing images via instruction provides a natural way to generate interactive content, but it is a big challenge due to the higher requirement of scene understanding and generation. Prior work utilizes a chain of large language models, object segmentation models, and editing models for this task. However, the understanding models provide only a single modality ability, restricting the editing quality. We aim to bridge understanding and generation via a new multi-modality model that provides the intelligent abilities to instruction-based image editing models for more complex cases. To achieve this goal, we individually separate the instruction editing task with the multi-modality chain of thought prompts, i.e., Chain-of-Thought (CoT) planning, editing region reasoning, and editing. For Chain-of-Thought planning, the large language model could reason the appropriate sub-prompts considering the instruction provided and the ability of the editing network. For editing region reasoning, we train an instruction-based editing region generation network with a multi-modal large language model. Finally, a hint-guided instruction-based editing network is proposed for editing image generations based on the sizeable text-to-image diffusion model to accept the hints for generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method has competitive editing abilities on complex real-world images.",

Specifically, to enhance Identifiability, we provide the reward model with full reference solutions as context, enabling fine-grained process verification to filter out false positives (samples with the right answer but low-quality reasoning process). To improve Reachability, we introduce a multi-turn sampling strategy where the reward model generates mistake reports for failed attempts, guiding the policy to \"recover\" correct responses from previously all-negative groups. Experimental results on 11 perception and reasoning benchmarks show that ContextRL significantly improves knowledge discovery efficiency. Notably, ContextRL enables the Qwen3-VL-8B model to achieve performance comparable to the 32B model, outperforming standard RLVR baselines by a large margin while effectively mitigating reward hacking. Our in-depth analysis reveals the significant potential of contextual information for improving reward model accuracy and document the widespread occurrence of reward hacking, offering valuable insights for future RLVR research.",

Despite recent progress, most popular approaches focus on tuning pseudo-label thresholds or refining the teacher-student framework, while overlooking object-level structural cues within cross-domain data. In this work, we present CGSA, the first framework that brings Object-Centric Learning (OCL) into SF-DAOD by integrating slot-aware adaptation into the DETR-based detector. Specifically, our approach integrates a Hierarchical Slot Awareness (HSA) module into the detector to progressively disentangle images into slot representations that act as visual priors. These slots are then guided toward class semantics via a Class-Guided Slot Contrast (CGSC) module, maintaining semantic consistency and prompting domain-invariant adaptation. Extensive experiments on multiple cross-domain datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous SF-DAOD methods, with theoretical derivations and experimental analysis further demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed components and the framework, thereby indicating the promise of object-centric design in privacy-sensitive adaptation scenarios.

We propose Latent Evolution Model (LEM), a hybrid machine learning framework with an autoencoder that projects high-dimensional phase spaces into lower-dimensional representations, coupled with transformers to learn temporal dynamics in the latent space. This approach provides a common foundational framework addressing multiple interconnected challenges in beam diagnostics. For \\textit{forward modeling}, a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) encodes 15 unique projections of the 6D phase space into a latent representation, while a transformer predicts downstream latent states from upstream inputs. For \\textit{inverse problems}, we address two distinct challenges: (a) predicting upstream phase spaces from downstream observations by utilizing the same CVAE architecture with transformers trained on reversed temporal sequences along with aleatoric uncertainty quantification, and (b) estimating RF settings from the latent space of the trained LEM using a dedicated dense neural network that maps latent representations to RF parameters. For \\textit{tuning problems}, we leverage the trained LEM and RF estimator within a Bayesian optimization framework to determine optimal RF settings that minimize beam loss.

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) obey consistent scaling laws -- empirical power-law fits that predict how loss decreases with compute, data, and parameters. While predictive, these laws are descriptive rather than prescriptive: they characterize typical training, not optimal training. Surprisingly few works have successfully challenged the data-efficiency bounds implied by these laws -- which is our primary focus. To that end, we introduce the Geodesic Hypothesis, positing that token sequences trace geodesics on a smooth semantic manifold and are therefore locally linear. Building on this principle, we propose a novel Semantic Tube Prediction (STP) task, a JEPA-style regularizer that confines hidden-state trajectories to a tubular neighborhood of the geodesic. STP generalizes JEPA to language without requiring explicit multi-view augmentations. We show this constraint improves signal-to-noise ratio, and consequently preserves diversity by preventing trajectory collisions during inference. Empirically, STP allows LLMs to match baseline accuracy with 16$\\times$ less training data on the NL-RX-SYNTH dataset, directly violating the data term of Chinchilla-style scaling laws and demonstrating that principled geometric priors can surpass brute-force scaling.

    "abstract": "Vision-language foundation models (VLFMs) promise zero-shot and retrieval understanding for Earth observation. While operational satellite systems often lack full multi-spectral coverage, making RGB-only inference highly desirable for scalable deployment, the adoption of VLFMs for satellite imagery remains hindered by two factors: (1) multi-spectral inputs are informative but difficult to exploit consistently due to band redundancy and misalignment; and (2) CLIP-style text encoders limit semantic expressiveness and weaken fine-grained alignment. We present SATtxt, a spectrum-aware VLFM that operates with RGB inputs only at inference while retaining spectral cues learned during training. Our framework comprises two stages. First, Spectral Representation Distillation transfers spectral priors from a frozen multi-spectral teacher to an RGB student via a lightweight projector. Second, Spectrally Grounded Alignment with Instruction-Augmented LLMs bridges the distilled visual space and an expressive LLM embedding space. Across EuroSAT, BigEarthNet, and ForestNet, SATtxt improves zero-shot classification on average by 4.2%, retrieval by 5.9%, and linear probing by 2.7% over baselines, showing an efficient path toward spectrum-aware vision-language learning for Earth observation.

    "title": "Mitigating Membership Inference in Intermediate Representations via Layer-wise MIA-risk-aware DP-SGD",
    "abstract": "In Embedding-as-an-Interface (EaaI) settings, pre-trained models are queried for Intermediate Representations (IRs). The distributional properties of IRs can leak training-set membership signals, enabling Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) whose strength varies across layers. Although Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) mitigates such leakage, existing implementations employ per-example gradient clipping and a uniform, layer-agnostic noise multiplier, ignoring heterogeneous layer-wise MIA vulnerability. This paper introduces Layer-wise MIA-risk-aware DP-SGD (LM-DP-SGD), which adaptively allocates privacy protection across layers in proportion to their MIA risk. Specifically, LM-DP-SGD trains a shadow model on a public shadow dataset, extracts per-layer IRs from its train/test splits, and fits layer-specific MIA adversaries, using their attack error rates as MIA-risk estimates. Leveraging the cross-dataset transferability of MIAs, these estimates are then used to reweight each layer's contribution to the globally clipped gradient during private training, providing layer-appropriate protection under a fixed noise magnitude. We further establish theoretical guarantees on both privacy and convergence of LM-DP-SGD. Extensive experiments show that, under the same privacy budget, LM-DP-SGD reduces the peak IR-level MIA risk while preserving utility, yielding a superior privacy-utility trade-off.",

    "title": "DP-aware AdaLN-Zero: Taming Conditioning-Induced Heavy-Tailed Gradients in Differentially Private Diffusion",
    "abstract": "Condition injection enables diffusion models to generate context-aware outputs, which is essential for many time-series tasks. However, heterogeneous conditional contexts (e.g., observed history, missingness patterns or outlier covariates) can induce heavy-tailed per-example gradients. Under Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD), these rare conditioning-driven heavy-tailed gradients disproportionately trigger global clipping, resulting in outlier-dominated updates, larger clipping bias, and degraded utility under a fixed privacy budget. In this paper, we propose DP-aware AdaLN-Zero, a drop-in sensitivity-aware conditioning mechanism for conditional diffusion transformers that limits conditioning-induced gain without modifying the DP-SGD mechanism. DP-aware AdaLN-Zero jointly constrains conditioning representation magnitude and AdaLN modulation parameters via bounded re-parameterization, suppressing extreme gradient tail events before gradient clipping and noise injection. Empirically, DP-SGD equipped with DP-aware AdaLN-Zero improves interpolation/imputation and forecasting under matched privacy settings. We observe consistent gains on a real-world power dataset and two public ETT benchmarks over vanilla DP-SGD. Moreover, gradient diagnostics attribute these improvements to conditioning-specific tail reshaping and reduced clipping distortion, while preserving expressiveness in non-private training. Overall, these results show that sensitivity-aware conditioning can substantially improve private conditional diffusion training without sacrificing standard performance.",

    "title": "EvolveGen: Algorithmic Level Hardware Model Checking Benchmark Generation through Reinforcement Learning",
    "abstract": "Progress in hardware model checking depends critically on high-quality benchmarks. However, the community faces a significant benchmark gap: existing suites are limited in number, often distributed only in representations such as BTOR2 without access to the originating register-transfer-level (RTL) designs, and biased toward extreme difficulty where instances are either trivial or intractable. These limitations hinder rigorous evaluation of new verification techniques and encourage overfitting of solver heuristics to a narrow set of problems. To address this, we introduce EvolveGen, a framework for generating hardware model checking benchmarks by combining reinforcement learning (RL) with high-level synthesis (HLS). Our approach operates at an algorithmic level of abstraction in which an RL agent learns to construct computation graphs. By compiling these graphs under different synthesis directives, we produce pairs of functionally equivalent but structurally distinct hardware designs, inducing challenging model checking instances. Solver runtime is used as the reward signal, enabling the agent to autonomously discover and generate small-but-hard instances that expose solver-specific weaknesses. Experiments show that EvolveGen efficiently creates a diverse benchmark set in standard formats (e.g., AIGER and BTOR2) and effectively reveals performance bottlenecks in state-of-the-art model checkers.",

    "abstract": "We present LoR-LUT, a unified low-rank formulation for compact and interpretable 3D lookup table (LUT) generation. Unlike conventional 3D-LUT-based techniques that rely on fusion of basis LUTs, which are usually dense tensors, our unified approach extends the current framework by jointly using residual corrections, which are in fact low-rank tensors, together with a set of basis LUTs. The approach described here improves the existing perceptual quality of an image, which is primarily due to the technique's novel use of residual corrections. At the same time, we achieve the same level of trilinear interpolation complexity, using a significantly smaller number of network, residual corrections, and LUT parameters. The experimental results obtained from LoR-LUT, which is trained on the MIT-Adobe FiveK dataset, reproduce expert-level retouching characteristics with high perceptual fidelity and a sub-megabyte model size. Furthermore, we introduce an interactive visualization tool, termed LoR-LUT Viewer, which transforms an input image into the LUT-adjusted output image, via a number of slidebars that control different parameters. The tool provides an effective way to enhance interpretability and user confidence in the visual results. Overall, our proposed formulation offers a compact, interpretable, and efficient direction for future LUT-based image enhancement and style transfer.",

    "abstract": "We propose CoLyricist, an AI-assisted lyric writing tool designed to support the typical workflows of experienced lyricists and enhance their creative efficiency. While lyricists have unique processes, many follow common stages. Tools that fail to accommodate these stages challenge integration into creative practices. Existing research and tools lack sufficient understanding of these songwriting stages and their associated challenges, resulting in ineffective designs. Through a formative study involving semi-structured interviews with 10 experienced lyricists, we identified four key stages: Theme Setting, Ideation, Drafting Lyrics, and Melody Fitting. CoLyricist addresses these needs by incorporating tailored AI-driven support for each stage, optimizing the lyric writing process to be more seamless and efficient. To examine whether this workflow-aligned design also benefits those without prior experience, we conducted a user study with 16 participants, including both experienced and novice lyricists. Results showed that CoLyricist enhances the songwriting experience across skill levels. Novice users especially appreciated the Melody-Fitting feature, while experienced users valued the Ideation support.",

    "abstract": "A thermodynamic framework for asymptotic inference is developed in which sample size and parameter variance define a state space. Within this description, Shannon information plays the role of entropy, and an integrating factor organizes its variation into a first-law-type balance equation. The framework supports a cyclic inequality analogous to a reversed second law, derived for the estimation of the mean. A non-trivial third-law-type result emerges as a lower bound on entropy set by representation noise. Optimal inference paths, global bounds on information gain, and a natural Carnot-like information efficiency follow from this structure, with efficiency fundamentally limited by a noise floor. Finally, de Bruijn's identity and the I-MMSE relation in the Gaussian-limit case appear as coordinate projections of the same underlying thermodynamic structure. This framework suggests that ensemble physics and inferential physics constitute shadow processes evolving in opposite directions within a unified thermodynamic description.",

    "abstract": "Long-running agentic tasks, such as deep research, require multi-hop reasoning over information distributed across multiple webpages and documents. In such tasks, the LLM context is dominated by tokens from external retrieval, causing memory usage to grow rapidly and limiting decode performance. While several KV cache compression techniques exist for long-context inputs, we find that existing heuristics fail to support multi-step reasoning models effectively. We address this challenge with SideQuest -- a novel approach that leverages the Large Reasoning Model (LRM) itself to perform KV cache compression by reasoning about the usefulness of tokens in its context. To prevent the tokens associated with this management process from polluting the model's memory, we frame KV cache compression as an auxiliary task executed in parallel to the main reasoning task. Our evaluations, using a model trained with just 215 samples, show that SideQuest reduces peak token usage by up to 65% on agentic tasks with minimal degradation in accuracy, outperforming heuristic-based KV cache compression techniques.",

    "abstract": "Fairness in Continual Learning for Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) is an emerging yet underexplored challenge, particularly in the presence of imbalanced data distributions that can lead to biased model updates and suboptimal performance across tasks. While recent continual learning studies have made progress in addressing catastrophic forgetting, the problem of fairness caused the imbalanced data remains largely underexplored. This paper presents a novel Fairness Direct Preference Optimization (FaiDPO or $φ$-DPO) framework for continual learning in LMMs. In particular, we first propose a new continual learning paradigm based on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to mitigate catastrophic forgetting by aligning learning with pairwise preference signals. Then, we identify the limitations of conventional DPO in imbalanced data and present a new $φ$-DPO loss that explicitly addresses distributional biases. We provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis demonstrating that our approach addresses both forgetting and data imbalance. Additionally, to enable $φ$-DPO-based continual learning, we construct pairwise preference annotations for existing benchmarks in the context of continual learning. Extensive experiments and ablation studies show the proposed $φ$-DPO achieves State-of-the-Art performance across multiple benchmarks, outperforming prior continual learning methods of LMMs.",

    "abstract": "Large language models exhibit sophisticated capabilities, yet understanding how they work internally remains a central challenge. A fundamental obstacle is that training selects for behavior, not circuitry, so many weight configurations can implement the same function. Which internal structures reflect the computation, and which are accidents of a particular training run? This work extracts algorithmic cores: compact subspaces necessary and sufficient for task performance. Independently trained transformers learn different weights but converge to the same cores. Markov-chain transformers embed 3D cores in nearly orthogonal subspaces yet recover identical transition spectra. Modular-addition transformers discover compact cyclic operators at grokking that later inflate, yielding a predictive model of the memorization-to-generalization transition. GPT-2 language models govern subject-verb agreement through a single axis that, when flipped, inverts grammatical number throughout generation across scales. These results reveal low-dimensional invariants that persist across training runs and scales, suggesting that transformer computations are organized around compact, shared algorithmic structures. Mechanistic interpretability could benefit from targeting such invariants -- the computational essence -- rather than implementation-specific details.",

Here, instead, we explore how responses across conditions relate by training linear spectrogram reconstruction models for each condition and evaluate their generalization across conditions. We demonstrate that linear decoders trained on one condition generally transfer successfully to others, implying shared speech representations. This commonality was assessed with stimulus-level discriminability by performing a rank-based analysis demonstrating preservation of stimulus-specific structure in both within- and across-conditions. Finally, we compared linear reconstructions to those from a nonlinear neural network. While both exhibited cross-condition transfer, linear models achieve superior stimulus-level discriminability.",

BetterScene leverages the production-ready Stable Video Diffusion (SVD) model pretrained on billions of frames as a strong backbone, aiming to mitigate artifacts and recover view-consistent details at inference time. Conventional methods have developed similar diffusion-based solutions to address these challenges of novel view synthesis. Despite significant improvements, these methods typically rely on off-the-shelf pretrained diffusion priors and fine-tune only the UNet module while keeping other components frozen, which still leads to inconsistent details and artifacts even when incorporating geometry-aware regularizations like depth or semantic conditions. To address this, we investigate the latent space of the diffusion model and introduce two components: (1) temporal equivariance regularization and (2) vision foundation model-aligned representation, both applied to the variational autoencoder (VAE) module within the SVD pipeline. BetterScene integrates a feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model to render features as inputs for the SVD enhancer and generate continuous, artifact-free, consistent novel views.

The latest version, YOLOv26, was recently released, while YOLOv12 achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with 55.2 mAP on the COCO val2017 dataset. Meanwhile, transformer-based object detection models, also known as DEtection TRansformer (DETR), have demonstrated impressive performance. RT-DETR is an outstanding model that outperformed the YOLO series in both speed and accuracy when it was released. Its successor, RT-DETRv2, achieved 53.4 mAP on the COCO val2017 dataset. However, despite their remarkable performance, all these models let information to slip away. They primarily focus on the features of foreground objects while neglecting the contextual information provided by the background. We believe that background information can significantly aid object detection tasks. For example, cars are more likely to appear on roads rather than in offices, while wild animals are more likely to be found in forests or remote areas rather than on busy streets. To address this gap, we propose an object detection model called Association DETR, which achieves state-of-the-art results compared to other object detection models on the COCO val2017 dataset.",

However, existing approaches either rely on full-sequence diffusion models with bidirectional generation, which limits temporal causality and real-time applicability, or autoregressive models that suffer from instability and cumulative errors. In this work, we present Causal Motion Diffusion Models (CMDM), a unified framework for autoregressive motion generation based on a causal diffusion transformer that operates in a semantically aligned latent space. CMDM builds upon a Motion-Language-Aligned Causal VAE (MAC-VAE), which encodes motion sequences into temporally causal latent representations. On top of this latent representation, an autoregressive diffusion transformer is trained using causal diffusion forcing to perform temporally ordered denoising across motion frames. To achieve fast inference, we introduce a frame-wise sampling schedule with causal uncertainty, where each subsequent frame is predicted from partially denoised previous frames. The resulting framework supports high-quality text-to-motion generation, streaming synthesis, and long-horizon motion generation at interactive rates. Experiments on HumanML3D and SnapMoGen demonstrate that CMDM outperforms existing diffusion and autoregressive models in both semantic fidelity and temporal smoothness, while substantially reducing inference latency.",

We present Flying Serving, a vLLM-based system that enables online DP-TP switching without restarting engine workers. Flying Serving makes reconfiguration practical by virtualizing the state that would otherwise force data movement: (i) a zero-copy Model Weights Manager that exposes TP shard views on demand, (ii) a KV Cache Adaptor that preserves request KV state across DP/TP layouts, (iii) an eagerly initialized Communicator Pool to amortize collective setup, and (iv) a deadlock-free scheduler that coordinates safe transitions under execution skew.

In this work, we identify a parameter democratization effect as a key bottleneck: the sensitivity of all parameters becomes homogenized, severely limiting expressivity. To address this, we propose pQuant, a method that decouples parameters by splitting linear layers into two specialized branches: a dominant 1-bit branch for efficient computation and a compact high-precision branch dedicated to preserving the most sensitive parameters. Through tailored feature scaling, we explicitly guide the model to allocate sensitive parameters to the high-precision branch. Furthermore, we extend this branch into multiple, sparsely-activated experts, enabling efficient capacity scaling.

    "title": "Where Relevance Emerges: A Layer-Wise Study of Internal Attention for Zero-Shot Re-Ranking",
    "abstract": "Zero-shot document re-ranking with Large Language Models (LLMs) has evolved from Pointwise methods to Listwise and Setwise approaches that optimize computational efficiency. Despite their success, these methods predominantly rely on generative scoring or output logits, which face bottlenecks in inference latency and result consistency. In-Context Re-ranking (ICR) has recently been proposed as an $O(1)$ alternative method. ICR extracts internal attention signals directly, avoiding the overhead of text generation. However, existing ICR methods simply aggregate signals across all layers; layer-wise contributions and their consistency across architectures have been left unexplored. Furthermore, no unified study has compared internal attention with traditional generative and likelihood-based mechanisms across diverse ranking frameworks under consistent conditions.   In this paper, we conduct an orthogonal evaluation of generation, likelihood, and internal attention mechanisms across multiple ranking frameworks. We further identify a universal \"bell-curve\" distribution of relevance signals across transformer layers, which motivates the proposed Selective-ICR strategy that reduces inference latency by 30%-50% without compromising effectiveness. Finally, evaluation on the reasoning-intensive BRIGHT benchmark shows that precisely capturing high-quality in-context attention signals fundamentally reduces the need for model scaling and reinforcement learning: a zero-shot 8B model matches the performance of 14B reinforcement-learned re-rankers, while even a 0.6B model outperforms state-of-the-art generation-based approaches. These findings redefine the efficiency-effectiveness frontier for LLM-based re-ranking and highlight the latent potential of internal signals for complex reasoning ranking tasks.

    "title": "TabDLM: Free-Form Tabular Data Generation via Joint Numerical-Language Diffusion",
    "abstract": "Synthetic tabular data generation has attracted growing attention due to its importance for data augmentation, foundation models, and privacy. However, real-world tabular datasets increasingly contain free-form text fields (e.g., reviews or clinical notes) alongside structured numerical and categorical attributes. Generating such heterogeneous tables with joint modeling of different modalities remains challenging. Existing approaches broadly fall into two categories: diffusion-based methods and LLM-based methods. Diffusion models can capture complex dependencies over numerical and categorical features in continuous or discrete spaces, but extending them to open-ended text is nontrivial and often leads to degraded text quality. In contrast, LLM-based generators naturally produce fluent text, yet their discrete tokenization can distort precise or wide-range numerical values, hindering accurate modeling of both numbers and language. In this work, we propose TabDLM, a unified framework for free-form tabular data generation via a joint numerical--language diffusion model built on masked diffusion language models (MDLMs). TabDLM models textual and categorical features through masked diffusion, while modeling numerical features with a continuous diffusion process through learned specialized numeric tokens embedding; bidirectional attention then captures cross-modality interactions within a single model. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of TabDLM compared to strong diffusion- and LLM-based baselines.",

    "abstract": "Human evaluations play a central role in training and assessing AI models, yet these data are rarely treated as measurements subject to systematic error. This paper integrates psychometric rater models into the AI pipeline to improve the reliability and validity of conclusions drawn from human judgments. The paper reviews common rater effects, severity and centrality, that distort observed ratings, and demonstrates how item response theory rater models, particularly the multi-faceted Rasch model, can separate true output quality from rater behavior. Using the OpenAI summarization dataset as an empirical example, we show how adjusting for rater severity produces corrected estimates of summary quality and provides diagnostic insight into rater performance. Incorporating psychometric modeling into human-in-the-loop evaluation offers more principled and transparent use of human data, enabling developers to make decisions based on adjusted scores rather than raw, error-prone ratings. This perspective highlights a path toward more robust, interpretable, and construct-aligned practices for AI development and evaluation.",

    "abstract": "Industrial advertising question answering (QA) is a high-stakes task in which hallucinated content, particularly fabricated URLs, can lead to financial loss, compliance violations, and legal risk. Although Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is widely adopted, deploying it in production remains challenging because industrial knowledge is inherently relational, frequently updated, and insufficiently aligned with generation objectives. We propose a reinforced co-adaptation framework that jointly optimizes retrieval and generation through two components: (1) Graph-aware Retrieval (GraphRAG), which models entity-relation structure over a high-citation knowledge subgraph for multi-hop, domain-specific evidence selection; and (2) evidence-constrained reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with multi-dimensional rewards covering faithfulness, style compliance, safety, and URL validity. Experiments on an internal advertising QA dataset show consistent gains across expert-judged dimensions including accuracy, completeness, and safety, while reducing the hallucination rate by 72\\%. A two-week online A/B test demonstrates a 28.6\\% increase in like rate, a 46.2\\% decrease in dislike rate, and a 92.7\\% reduction in URL hallucination. The system has been running in production for over half a year and has served millions of QA interactions.",

    "abstract": "Example-based guidance is widely used to improve mathematical reasoning at inference time, yet its effectiveness is highly unstable across problems and models-even when the guidance is correct and problem-relevant. We show that this instability arises from a previously underexplored gap between strategy usage-whether a reasoning strategy appears in successful solutions-and strategy executability-whether the strategy remains effective when instantiated as guidance for a target model. Through a controlled analysis of paired human-written and model-generated solutions, we identify a systematic dissociation between usage and executability: human- and model-derived strategies differ in structured, domain-dependent ways, leading to complementary strengths and consistent source-dependent reversals under guidance. Building on this diagnosis, we propose Selective Strategy Retrieval (SSR), a test-time framework that explicitly models executability by selectively retrieving and combining strategies using empirical, multi-route, source-aware signals. Across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, SSR yields reliable and consistent improvements over direct solving, in-context learning, and single-source guidance, improving accuracy by up to $+13$ points on AIME25 and $+5$ points on Apex for compact reasoning models.

IBCircuit is an optimization framework for holistic circuit discovery and can be applied to any given task without tediously corrupted activation design.

    "abstract": "Shuffle exchanges intermediate results between upstream and downstream operators in distributed data processing and is usually the bottleneck due to factors such as small random I/Os and network contention. Several systems have been designed to improve shuffle efficiency, but from our experiences of running ultra-large clusters at Alibaba Cloud MaxCompute platform, we observe that they can not adapt to highly dynamic job characteristics and cluster resource conditions, and their fault tolerance mechanisms are passive and inefficient when failures are inevitable. To tackle their limitations, we design and implement FuxiShuffle as a general data shuffle service for the ultra-large production environment of MaxCompute, featuring good adaptability and efficient failure resilience. Specifically, to achieve good adaptability, FuxiShuffle dynamically selects the shuffle mode based on runtime information, conducts progress-aware scheduling for the downstream workers, and automatically determines the most suitable backup strategy for each shuffle data chunk. To make failure resilience efficient, FuxiShuffle actively ensures data availability with multi-replica failover, prevents memory overflow with careful memory management, and employs an incremental recovery mechanism that does not lose computation progress. Our experiments show that, compared to baseline systems, FuxiShuffle significantly reduces not only end-to-end job completion time but also aggregate resource consumption. Micro experiments suggest that our designs are effective in improving adaptability and failure resilience.",

    "abstract": "Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are multimodal robotic task controllers that, given an instruction and visual inputs, produce a sequence of low-level control actions (or motor commands) enabling a robot to execute the requested task in the physical environment. These systems face the test oracle problem from multiple perspectives. On the one hand, a test oracle must be defined for each instruction prompt, which is a complex and non-generalizable approach. On the other hand, current state-of-the-art oracles typically capture symbolic representations of the world (e.g., robot and object states), enabling the correctness evaluation of a task, but fail to assess other critical aspects, such as the quality with which VLA-enabled robots perform a task. In this paper, we explore whether Metamorphic Testing (MT) can alleviate the test oracle problem in this context. To do so, we propose two metamorphic relation patterns and five metamorphic relations to assess whether changes to the test inputs impact the original trajectory of the VLA-enabled robots. An empirical study involving five VLA models, two simulated robots, and four robotic tasks shows that MT can effectively alleviate the test oracle problem by automatically detecting diverse types of failures, including, but not limited to, uncompleted tasks. More importantly, the proposed MRs are generalizable, making the proposed approach applicable across different VLA models, robots, and tasks, even in the absence of test oracles.",

We propose Search-P1, a framework that introduces path-centric reward shaping for agentic RAG training, comprising two key components: (1) Path-Centric Reward, which evaluates the structural quality of reasoning trajectories through order-agnostic step coverage and soft scoring that extracts learning signals even from failed samples, and (2) Dual-Track Path Scoring with offline-generated reference planners that assesses paths from both self-consistency and reference-alignment perspectives.

    "abstract": "Attention scales quadratically with sequence length, fundamentally limiting long-context inference. Existing block-granularity sparsification can reduce latency, but coarse blocks impose an intrinsic sparsity ceiling, making further improvements difficult even with carefully engineered designs. We present S2O, which performs early stopping for sparse attention via online permutation. Inspired by virtual-to-physical address mapping in memory systems, S2O revisits and factorizes FlashAttention execution, enabling inference to load non-contiguous tokens rather than a contiguous span in the original order. Motivated by fine-grained structures in attention heatmaps, we transform explicit permutation into an online, index-guided, discrete loading policy; with extremely lightweight preprocessing and index-remapping overhead, it concentrates importance on a small set of high-priority blocks. Building on this importance-guided online permutation for loading, S2O further introduces an early-stopping rule: computation proceeds from high to low importance; once the current block score falls below a threshold, S2O terminates early and skips the remaining low-contribution blocks, thereby increasing effective sparsity and reducing computation under a controlled error budget.   As a result, S2O substantially raises the practical sparsity ceiling. On Llama-3.1-8B under a 128K context, S2O reduces single-operator MSE by 3.82$\\times$ at matched sparsity, and reduces prefill compute density by 3.31$\\times$ at matched MSE; meanwhile, it preserves end-to-end accuracy and achieves 7.51$\\times$ attention and 3.81$\\times$ end-to-end speedups.",

    "abstract": "Feed-forward 3D reconstruction offers substantial runtime advantages over per-scene optimization, which remains slow at inference and often fragile under sparse views. However, existing feed-forward methods still have potential for further performance gains, especially for out-of-domain data, and struggle to retain second-level inference time once a generative prior is introduced. These limitations stem from the one-shot prediction paradigm in existing feed-forward pipeline: models are strictly bounded by capacity, lack inference-time refinement, and are ill-suited for continuously injecting generative priors. We introduce GIFSplat, a purely feed-forward iterative refinement framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting from sparse unposed views. A small number of forward-only residual updates progressively refine current 3D scene using rendering evidence, achieve favorable balance between efficiency and quality. Furthermore, we distill a frozen diffusion prior into Gaussian-level cues from enhanced novel renderings without gradient backpropagation or ever-increasing view-set expansion, thereby enabling per-scene adaptation with generative prior while preserving feed-forward efficiency. Across DL3DV, RealEstate10K, and DTU, GIFSplat consistently outperforms state-of-the-art feed-forward baselines, improving PSNR by up to +2.1 dB, and it maintains second-scale inference time without requiring camera poses or any test-time gradient optimization.",

    "abstract": "Classifier-free guidance (CFG) has helped diffusion models achieve great conditional generation in various fields. Recently, more diffusion guidance methods have emerged with improved generation quality and human preference. However, can these emerging diffusion guidance methods really achieve solid and significant improvements? In this paper, we rethink recent progress on diffusion guidance. Our work mainly consists of four contributions. First, we reveal a critical evaluation pitfall that common human preference models exhibit a strong bias towards large guidance scales. Simply increasing the CFG scale can easily improve quantitative evaluation scores due to strong semantic alignment, even if image quality is severely damaged (e.g., oversaturation and artifacts). Second, we introduce a novel guidance-aware evaluation (GA-Eval) framework that employs effective guidance scale calibration to enable fair comparison between current guidance methods and CFG by identifying the effects orthogonal and parallel to CFG effects. Third, motivated by the evaluation pitfall, we design Transcendent Diffusion Guidance (TDG) method that can significantly improve human preference scores in the conventional evaluation framework but actually does not work in practice. Fourth, in extensive experiments, we empirically evaluate recent eight diffusion guidance methods within the conventional evaluation framework and the proposed GA-Eval framework. Notably, simply increasing the CFG scales can compete with most studied diffusion guidance methods, while all methods suffer severely from winning rate degradation over standard CFG. Our work would strongly motivate the community to rethink the evaluation paradigm and future directions of this field.",

Existing noisy robust methods predominantly rely on a simplified binary assumption, treating data as either perfectly clean or completely corrupted. This overlooks the prevalent existence of heterogeneous observation noise, where contamination intensity varies continuously across data. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework termed Quality-Aware Robust Multi-View Clustering (QARMVC). Specifically, QARMVC employs an information bottleneck mechanism to extract intrinsic semantics for view reconstruction. Leveraging the insight that noise disrupts semantic integrity and impedes reconstruction, we utilize the resulting reconstruction discrepancy to precisely quantify fine-grained contamination intensity and derive instance-level quality scores. These scores are integrated into a hierarchical learning strategy: at the feature level, a quality-weighted contrastive objective is designed to adaptively suppress the propagation of noise; at the fusion level, a high-quality global consensus is constructed via quality-weighted aggregation, which is subsequently utilized to align and rectify local views via mutual information maximization. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that QARMVC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in scenarios with heterogeneous noise intensities.",

Here, we propose SwiftNDC, a fast and general framework built around a Neural Depth Correction field that produces cross-view consistent depth maps. From these refined depths, we generate a dense point cloud through back-projection and robust reprojection-error filtering, obtaining a clean and uniformly distributed geometric initialization for downstream reconstruction. This reliable dense geometry substantially accelerates 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for mesh reconstruction, enabling high-quality surfaces with significantly fewer optimization iterations. For novel-view synthesis, SwiftNDC can also improve 3DGS rendering quality, highlighting the benefits of strong geometric initialization. We conduct a comprehensive study across five datasets, including two for mesh reconstruction, as well as three for novel-view synthesis. SwiftNDC consistently reduces running time for accurate mesh reconstruction and boosts rendering fidelity for view synthesis, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining neural depth refinement with robust geometric initialization for high-fidelity and efficient 3D reconstruction.",

We compared this to having participants run a web search, have a conversation with an unspecialised LLM, and no intervention. The personalised climate LLM was the only condition that led to increased knowledge about the impacts of climate actions and greater intentions to adopt impactful behaviours. While the personalised climate LLM did not outperform a web search in improving understanding of climate action impacts, the ability of LLMs to deliver personalised, actionable guidance may make them more effective at motivating impactful pro-climate behaviour change.",

    "title": "Layer-Targeted Multilingual Knowledge Erasure in Large Language Models",
    "abstract": "Recent work has demonstrated that machine unlearning in Large Language Models (LLMs) fails to generalize across languages: knowledge erased in one language frequently remains accessible through others. However, the underlying cause of this failure and a principled solution remain open. In this work, we identify intervention depth as the key factor determining multilingual generalization. Through systematic layer-wise experiments, we characterize two distinct failure modes: shallow-layer interventions achieve erasure but collapse multilingual capabilities in held-out languages, while deep-layer interventions preserve utility but fail to erase target knowledge even in source languages. These findings reveal that the choice of intervention layer is not a free parameter; it fundamentally determines whether multilingual unlearning succeeds. We propose MUTE (Multilingual Unlearning via Targeted Erasure), a framework that uses Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) and Linguistic Regions Development Score (LRDS) to identify intermediate, language-agnostic layers where cross-lingual representations converge. By restricting unlearning updates to these layers, MUTE achieves robust multilingual knowledge erasure while optimizing on only a small set of source languages. Extensive experiments across three LLM architectures and three unlearning algorithms validate our approach, with mechanistic analysis via Logit Lens probing confirming genuine knowledge removal rather than output-level suppression.",

    "abstract": "The deployment of machine learning in high-stakes domains requires a balance between predictive safety and algorithmic fairness. However, existing fairness interventions often as- sume unconstrained resources and employ group-specific decision thresholds that violate anti- discrimination regulations. We introduce a post-hoc, model-agnostic threshold optimization framework that jointly balances safety, efficiency, and equity under strict and hard capacity constraints. To ensure legal compliance, the framework enforces a single, global decision thresh- old. We formulated a parameterized ethical loss function coupled with a bounded decision rule that mathematically prevents intervention volumes from exceeding the available resources. An- alytically, we prove the key properties of the deployed threshold, including local monotonicity with respect to ethical weighting and the formal identification of critical capacity regimes. We conducted extensive experimental evaluations on diverse high-stakes datasets. The principal re- sults demonstrate that capacity constraints dominate ethical priorities; the strict resource limit determines the final deployed threshold in over 80% of the tested configurations. Furthermore, under a restrictive 25% capacity limit, the proposed framework successfully maintains high risk identification (recall ranging from 0.409 to 0.702), whereas standard unconstrained fairness heuristics collapse to a near-zero utility. We conclude that theoretical fairness objectives must be explicitly subordinated to operational capacity limits to remain in deployment. By decou- pling predictive scoring from policy evaluation and strictly bounding intervention rates, this framework provides a practical and legally compliant mechanism for stakeholders to navigate unavoidable ethical trade-offs in resource-constrained environments.",

To address this, we introduce CourtGuard, a retrieval-augmented multi-agent framework that reimagines safety evaluation as Evidentiary Debate. By orchestrating an adversarial debate grounded in external policy documents, CourtGuard achieves state-of-the-art performance across 7 safety benchmarks, outperforming dedicated policy-following baselines without fine-tuning. Beyond standard metrics, we highlight two critical capabilities: (1) Zero-Shot Adaptability, where our framework successfully generalized to an out-of-domain Wikipedia Vandalism task (achieving 90\\% accuracy) by swapping the reference policy; and (2) Automated Data Curation and Auditing, where we leveraged CourtGuard to curate and audit nine novel datasets of sophisticated adversarial attacks.

    "abstract": "Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve strong performance through extended reasoning traces, but they often exhibit overthinking behavior for low-complexity queries. Existing efforts to mitigate this issue are fundamentally limited by unstable accuracy-efficiency trade-offs and poor robustness to heterogeneous reasoning behaviors. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage framework for stable adaptive thinking in LRMs. The framework first applies Hybrid Fine-Tuning to expose the model to both thinking and no-thinking behaviors, establishing well-conditioned initialization. It then performs adaptive reinforcement learning with Correctness-Preserving Advantage Shaping (CPAS) to avoid suppressing correct long-chain reasoning, and Length-Aware Gradient Regulation (LAGR) to stabilize optimization under severe reasoning-length heterogeneity. Extensive experiments on Qwen2.5-1.5B and 7B show consistent improvements over strong baselines, achieving up to +3.7/+3.6 accuracy points while reducing generated tokens by 40.6%/43.9%. Further analyses across varying problem difficulties and out-of-distribution tasks confirm the robustness and generalization of our approach.",

    "abstract": "Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals have become a popular medium for decoding visual information due to their cost-effectiveness and high temporal resolution. However, current approaches face significant challenges in bridging the modality gap between EEG and image data. These methods typically rely on complex adaptation processes involving multiple stages, making it hard to maintain consistency and manage compounding errors. Furthermore, the computational overhead imposed by large-scale diffusion models limit their practicality in real-world brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. In this work, we present AVDE, a lightweight and efficient framework for visual decoding from EEG signals. First, we leverage LaBraM, a pre-trained EEG model, and fine-tune it via contrastive learning to align EEG and image representations. Second, we adopt an autoregressive generative framework based on a \"next-scale prediction\" strategy: images are encoded into multi-scale token maps using a pre-trained VQ-VAE, and a transformer is trained to autoregressively predict finer-scale tokens starting from EEG embeddings as the coarsest representation. This design enables coherent generation while preserving a direct connection between the input EEG signals and the reconstructed images. Experiments on two datasets show that AVDE outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in both image retrieval and reconstruction tasks, while using only 10% of the parameters. In addition, visualization of intermediate outputs shows that the generative process of AVDE reflects the hierarchical nature of human visual perception. These results highlight the potential of autoregressive models as efficient and interpretable tools for practical BCI applications.",

We derive a closed-form solution to optimally map the harmful representations of LRLs to the robust safety subspaces of HRLs, while preserving general utility via a null-space projection constraint. Extensive experiments across 8 languages and multiple model families (Llama-3, Qwen-2.5) demonstrate that our method substantially reduces Attack Success Rate (ASR) in LRLs with negligible impact on general reasoning capabilities, all achieved with a single, data-efficient calculation.",

    "abstract": "Predictive modeling over relational databases (RDBs) powers applications, yet remains challenging due to capturing both cross-table dependencies and complex feature interactions. Relational Deep Learning (RDL) methods automate feature engineering via message passing, while classical approaches like Deep Feature Synthesis (DFS) rely on predefined non-parametric aggregators. Despite performance gains, the comparative advantages of RDL over DFS and the design principles for selecting effective architectures remain poorly understood. We present a comprehensive study that unifies RDL and DFS in a shared design space and conducts architecture-centric searches across diverse RDB tasks. Our analysis yields three key findings: (1) RDL does not consistently outperform DFS, with performance being highly task-dependent; (2) no single architecture dominates across tasks, underscoring the need for task-aware model selection; and (3) validation accuracy is an unreliable guide for architecture choice. This search yields a model performance bank that links architecture configurations to their performance; leveraging this bank, we analyze the drivers of the RDL-DFS performance gap and introduce two task signals -- RDB task homophily and an affinity embedding that captures size, path, feature, and temporal structure -- whose correlation with the gap enables principled routing. Guided by these signals, we propose Relatron, a task embedding-based meta-selector that chooses between RDL and DFS and prunes the within-family search. Lightweight loss-landscape metrics further guard against brittle checkpoints by preferring flatter optima. In experiments, Relatron resolves the \"more tuning, worse performance\" effect and, in joint hyperparameter-architecture optimization, achieves up to 18.5% improvement over strong baselines with 10x lower cost than Fisher information-based alternatives.",

Identifying these combinations is critical for understanding carcinogenesis and designing targeted therapies. We formalise this challenge as the Multi-Hit Cancer Driver Set Cover Problem (MHCDSCP), a binary classification problem that selects gene combinations to maximise coverage of tumor samples while minimising coverage of normal samples. Existing approaches typically rely on exhaustive search and supercomputing infrastructure. In this paper, we present constraint programming and mixed integer programming formulations of the MHCDSCP. Evaluated on real-world cancer genomics data, our methods achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while running on a single commodity CPU in under a minute. Furthermore, we introduce a column generation heuristic capable of solving small instances to optimality. These results suggest that solving the MHCDSCP is less computationally intensive than previously believed, thereby opening research directions for exploring modelling assumptions.",

    "abstract": "Synthesis of diverse driving scenes serves as a crucial data augmentation technique for validating the robustness and generalizability of autonomous driving systems. Current methods aggregate high-definition (HD) maps and 3D bounding boxes as geometric conditions in diffusion models for conditional scene generation. However, implicit inter-condition dependency causes generation failures when control conditions change independently. Additionally, these methods suffer from insufficient details in both semantic and structural aspects. Specifically, brief and view-invariant captions restrict semantic contexts, resulting in weak background modeling. Meanwhile, the standard denoising loss with uniform spatial weighting neglects foreground structural details, causing visual distortions and blurriness. To address these challenges, we propose DrivePTS, which incorporates three key innovations. Firstly, our framework adopts a progressive learning strategy to mitigate inter-dependency between geometric conditions, reinforced by an explicit mutual information constraint. Secondly, a Vision-Language Model is utilized to generate multi-view hierarchical descriptions across six semantic aspects, providing fine-grained textual guidance. Thirdly, a frequency-guided structure loss is introduced to strengthen the model's sensitivity to high-frequency elements, improving foreground structural fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our DrivePTS achieves state-of-the-art fidelity and controllability in generating diverse driving scenes. Notably, DrivePTS successfully generates rare scenes where prior methods fail, highlighting its strong generalization ability.",

However, this paradigm has two significant limitations: (1) It is difficult adapt the DR to a new domain if the training dataset is limited.   (2) Old DR models are simply replaced by newer models that are trained from scratch when the former are no longer up to date. Especially for scenarios where the model needs to be updated frequently, this paradigm is prohibitively expensive. To address these challenges, we propose a novel dense retrieval approach, termed \\textit{dynamic dense retrieval} (DDR). DDR uses \\textit{prefix tuning} as a \\textit{module} specialized for a specific domain. These modules can then be compositional combined with a dynamic routing strategy, enabling highly flexible domain adaptation in the retrieval part. Extensive evaluation on six zero-shot downstream tasks demonstrates that this approach can surpass DR while utilizing only 2\\% of the training parameters, paving the way to achieve more flexible dense retrieval in IR. We see it as a promising future direction for applying dense retrieval to various tasks.",

    "abstract": "Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) is widely used in dental and maxillofacial imaging, but low-dose acquisition introduces strong, spatially varying noise that degrades soft-tissue visibility and obscures fine anatomical structures. Classical denoising methods struggle to suppress noise in CBCT while preserving edges. Although deep learning-based approaches offer high-fidelity restoration, their use in CBCT denoising is limited by the scarcity of high-resolution CBCT data for supervised training. To address this research gap, we propose a novel Hybrid Attention Residual U-Net (HARU-Net) for high-quality denoising of CBCT data, trained on a cadaver dataset of human hemimandibles acquired using a high-resolution protocol of the 3D Accuitomo 170 (J. Morita, Kyoto, Japan) CBCT system. The novel contribution of this approach is the integration of three complementary architectural components: (i) a hybrid attention transformer block (HAB) embedded within each skip connection to selectively emphasize salient anatomical features, (ii) a residual hybrid attention transformer group (RHAG) at the bottleneck to strengthen global contextual modeling and long-range feature interactions, and (iii) residual learning convolutional blocks to facilitate deeper, more stable feature extraction throughout the network. HARU-Net consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods including SwinIR and Uformer, achieving the highest PSNR (37.52 dB), highest SSIM (0.9557), and lowest GMSD (0.1084). This effective and clinically reliable CBCT denoising is achieved at a computational cost significantly lower than that of the SOTA methods, offering a practical advancement toward improving diagnostic quality in low-dose CBCT imaging.",

We explore the concept of relational appliances: everyday household devices designed as embodied social actors that engage users through ongoing, personalized interaction. We focus on the refrigerator, whose unique affordances, including a fixed, sensor-rich environment, private interaction space, and close coupling to food items, support contextualized, conversational engagement during snack choices. We present an initial exploration of this concept through a pilot study deploying an anthropomorphic robotic head inside a household refrigerator. In a home-lab apartment, participants repeatedly retrieved snacks during simulated TV \"commercial breaks\" while interacting with a human-sized robotic head. Participants were randomized to either a health-promotion condition, in which the robot made healthy snack recommendations, or a social-chat control condition. Outcomes included compliance with recommendations, nutritional quality of selected snacks, and psychosocial measures related to acceptance of the robot. Results suggest that participants found the robot persuasive, socially engaging, and increasingly natural over time, often describing it as helpful, aware, and companionable. Most participants reported greater awareness of their snack decisions and expressed interest in having such a robot in their own home. We discuss implications for designing relational appliances that leverage anthropomorphism, trust, and long-term human-technology relationships for home-based health promotion.",

    "abstract": "Building a useful quantum computer is a grand science and engineering challenge, currently pursued intensely by teams around the world. In the 1980s, Richard Feynman and Yuri Manin observed independently that computers based on quantum mechanics might enable better simulations of quantum phenomena. Their vision remained an intellectual curiosity until Peter Shor published his famous quantum algorithm for integer factoring, and shortly thereafter a proof that errors in quantum computations can be corrected. Since then, quantum computing R&D has progressed rapidly, from small-scale experiments in university physics laboratories to well-funded industrial efforts and prototypes. Hype notwithstanding, quantum computers have yet to solve scientifically or practically important problems -- a target often called quantum utility. In this article, we describe the capabilities of contemporary quantum computers, compare them to the requirements of quantum utility, and illustrate how to track progress from today to utility. We highlight key science and engineering challenges on the road to quantum utility, touching on relevant aspects of our own research.",

    "title": "Agentic AI for Intent-driven Optimization in Cell-free O-RAN",
    "abstract": "Agentic artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as a key enabler for autonomous radio access networks (RANs), where multiple large language model (LLM)-based agents reason and collaborate to achieve operator-defined intents. The open RAN (O-RAN) architecture enables the deployment and coordination of such agents. However, most existing works consider simple intents handled by independent agents, while complex intents that require coordination among agents remain unexplored. In this paper, we propose an agentic AI framework for intent translation and optimization in cell-free O-RAN. A supervisor agent translates the operator intents into an optimization objective and minimum rate requirements. Based on this information, a user weighting agent retrieves relevant prior experience from a memory module to determine the user priority weights for precoding. If the intent includes an energy-saving objective, then an open radio unit (O-RU) management agent will also be activated to determine the set of active O-RUs by using a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm. A monitoring agent measures and monitors the user data rates and coordinates with other agents to guarantee the minimum rate requirements are satisfied. To enhance scalability, we adopt a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method that enables the same underlying LLM to be used for different agents. Simulation results show that the proposed agentic AI framework reduces the number of active O-RUs by 41.93% when compared with three baseline schemes in energy-saving mode. Using the PEFT method, the proposed framework reduces the memory usage by 92% when compared with deploying separate LLM agents.",

    "abstract": "Large reasoning models (LRMs) excel at a long chain of reasoning but often fail to faithfully follow instructions regarding output format, constraints, or specific requirements. We investigate whether this gap can be closed by integrating an instruction-tuned model (ITM) into an LRM. Analyzing their differences in parameter space, namely task vectors, we find that their principal subspaces are nearly orthogonal across key modules, suggesting a lightweight merging with minimal interference. However, we also demonstrate that naive merges are fragile because they overlook the output format mismatch between LRMs (with explicit thinking and response segments) and ITMs (answers-only). We introduce RAIN-Merging (Reasoning-Aware Instruction-attention guided Null-space projection Merging), a gradient-free method that integrates instruction following while preserving thinking format and reasoning performance. First, with a small reasoning calibration set, we project the ITM task vector onto the null space of forward features at thinking special tokens, which preserves the LRM's structured reasoning mechanisms. Second, using a small instruction calibration set, we estimate instruction attention to derive module-specific scaling that amplifies instruction-relevant components and suppresses leakage. Across four instruction-following benchmarks and nine reasoning & general capability benchmarks, RAIN-Merging substantially improves instruction adherence while maintaining reasoning quality. The gains are consistent across model scales and architectures, translating to improved performance in agent settings.",

By employing semi-stochastic gating and reparameterization techniques, LUMOS dynamically selects informative features and prunes redundant parameters during training, reducing the reliance on manual tuning while maintaining predictive accuracy. We evaluate LUMOS across 13 diverse SciML workloads, including cosmology and molecular sciences, and demonstrate its effectiveness and generalizability. Experiments on 13 SciML models show that LUMOS achieves 71.45% parameter reduction and a 6.4x inference speedup on average.

    "abstract": "Matrix factorization techniques, especially Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF), have been widely used for dimensionality reduction and interpretable data representation. However, existing NMF-based methods are inherently single-scale and fail to capture the evolution of connectivity structures across resolutions. In this work, we propose persistent nonnegative matrix factorization (pNMF), a scale-parameterized family of NMF problems, that produces a sequence of persistence-aligned embeddings rather than a single one. By leveraging persistent homology, we identify a canonical minimal sufficient scale set at which the underlying connectivity undergoes qualitative changes. These canonical scales induce a sequence of graph Laplacians, leading to a coupled NMF formulation with scale-wise geometric regularization and explicit cross-scale consistency constraint. We analyze the structural properties of the embeddings along the scale parameter and establish bounds on their increments between consecutive scales. The resulting model defines a nontrivial solution path across scales, rather than a single factorization, which poses new computational challenges. We develop a sequential alternating optimization algorithm with guaranteed convergence. Numerical experiments on synthetic and single-cell RNA sequencing datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in multi-scale low-rank embeddings.",

    "abstract": "Learning the dynamic causal structure of time series is a challenging problem. Most existing approaches rely on distributional or structural invariance to uncover underlying causal dynamics, assuming stationary or partially stationary causality. However, these assumptions often conflict with the complex, time-varying causal relationships observed in real-world systems. This motivates the need for methods that address fully dynamic causality, where both instantaneous and lagged dependencies evolve over time. Such a setting poses significant challenges for the efficiency and stability of causal discovery. To address these challenges, we introduce DyCausal, a dynamic causal structure learning framework. DyCausal leverages convolutional networks to capture causal patterns within coarse-grained time windows, and then applies linear interpolation to refine causal structures at each time step, thereby recovering fine-grained and time-varying causal graphs. In addition, we propose an acyclic constraint based on matrix norm scaling, which improves efficiency while effectively constraining loops in evolving causal structures. Comprehensive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that DyCausal achieves superior performance compared to existing methods, offering a stable and efficient approach for identifying fully dynamic causal structures from coarse to fine.",

To help understand the players' serve decisions, we have developed a machine learning method for predicting professional tennis players' first serve directions. Through feature engineering, our method achieves an average prediction accuracy of around 49\\% for male players and 44\\% for female players. Our analysis provides some evidence that top professional players use a mixed-strategy model in serving decisions and that fatigue might be a factor in choosing serve directions.

We identify five systems-level attack surfaces, including two emergent failures observed during live testbed operation: coordination-state divergence and induced trust erosion. We frame core security properties as measurable systems metrics: data egress volume, failover window exposure, sovereignty boundary integrity, and provenance chain completeness. Our measurements show that edge-local deployments eliminate routine cloud data exposure but silently degrade sovereignty when fallback mechanisms trigger, with boundary crossings invisible at the application layer. Provenance chains remain complete under cooperative operation yet are trivially bypassed without cryptographic enforcement. Failover windows create transient blind spots exploitable for unauthorised actuation. These results demonstrate that deployment architecture, not just model or prompt design, is a primary determinant of security risk in agent-controlled IoT systems.",

To make this point clear, we formalize the idea of an agent template that specifies roles for individual LLMs and how their functionalities should be composed.

Traditional ASR models often encounter difficulties in this context, as they tend to conflate essential linguistic content with dialect-specific variations across both phonological and lexical dimensions. To address these challenges, we propose a unified framework grounded in the Recurrent Neural Network Transducers (RNN-T). Central to our approach is the introduction of dialect-aware modeling strategies designed to disentangle dialectal \"style\" from linguistic \"content\", which enhances the model's capacity to learn robust and generalized representations. Additionally, the framework employs parameter-efficient prediction networks to concurrently model ASR (Hanzi and Pinyin). We demonstrate that these tasks create a powerful synergy, wherein the cross-script objective serves as a mutual regularizer to improve the primary ASR tasks. Experiments conducted on the HAT corpus reveal that our model achieves 57.00% and 40.41% relative error rate reduction on Hanzi and Pinyin ASR, respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic investigation into the impact of Hakka dialectal variations on ASR and the first single model capable of jointly addressing these tasks.",

    "abstract": "The negative sampling strategy can effectively train collaborative filtering (CF) recommendation models based on implicit feedback by constructing positive and negative samples. However, existing methods primarily optimize the negative sampling process while neglecting the exploration of positive samples. Some denoising recommendation methods can be applied to denoise positive samples within negative sampling strategies, but they ignore temporal information. Existing work integrates sequential information during model aggregation but neglects time interval information, hindering accurate capture of users' current preferences. To address this problem, from a data perspective, we propose a novel temporal filtration-enhanced approach to construct a high-quality positive sample set. First, we design a time decay model based on interaction time intervals, transforming the original graph into a weighted user-item bipartite graph. Then, based on predefined filtering operations, the weighted user-item bipartite graph is layered. Finally, we design a layer-enhancement strategy to construct a high-quality positive sample set for the layered subgraphs. We provide theoretical insights into why TFPS can improve Recall@k and NDCG@k, and extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Additionally, TFPS can be integrated with various implicit CF recommenders or negative sampling methods to enhance its performance.",

    "abstract": "Time series forecasting plays a critical role in domains such as transportation, energy, and meteorology. Despite their success, modern deep forecasting models are typically trained to minimize point-wise prediction loss without leveraging the rich information contained in past prediction residuals from rolling forecasts - residuals that reflect persistent biases, unmodeled patterns, or evolving dynamics. We propose TEFL (Temporal Error Feedback Learning), a unified learning framework that explicitly incorporates these historical residuals into the forecasting pipeline during both training and evaluation. To make this practical in deep multi-step settings, we address three key challenges: (1) selecting observable multi-step residuals under the partial observability of rolling forecasts, (2) integrating them through a lightweight low-rank adapter to preserve efficiency and prevent overfitting, and (3) designing a two-stage training procedure that jointly optimizes the base forecaster and error module. Extensive experiments across 10 real-world datasets and 5 backbone architectures show that TEFL consistently improves accuracy, reducing MAE by 5-10% on average. Moreover, it demonstrates strong robustness under abrupt changes and distribution shifts, with error reductions exceeding 10% (up to 19.5%) in challenging scenarios. By embedding residual-based feedback directly into the learning process, TEFL offers a simple, general, and effective enhancement to modern deep forecasting systems.",

    "title": "A Mathematical Theory of Agency and Intelligence",
    "abstract": "To operate reliably under changing conditions, complex systems require feedback on how effectively they use resources, not just whether objectives are met. Current AI systems process vast information to produce sophisticated predictions, yet predictions can appear successful while the underlying interaction with the environment degrades. What is missing is a principled measure of how much of the total information a system deploys is actually shared between its observations, actions, and outcomes. We prove this shared fraction, which we term bipredictability, P, is intrinsic to any interaction, derivable from first principles, and strictly bounded: P can reach unity in quantum systems, P equal to, or smaller than 0.5 in classical systems, and lower once agency (action selection) is introduced. We confirm these bounds in a physical system (double pendulum), reinforcement learning agents, and multi turn LLM conversations. These results distinguish agency from intelligence: agency is the capacity to act on predictions, whereas intelligence additionally requires learning from interaction, self-monitoring of its learning effectiveness, and adapting the scope of observations, actions, and outcomes to restore effective learning. By this definition, current AI systems achieve agency but not intelligence. Inspired by thalamocortical regulation in biological systems, we demonstrate a feedback architecture that monitors P in real time, establishing a prerequisite for adaptive, resilient AI.",

    "title": "RepoMod-Bench: A Benchmark for Code Repository Modernization via Implementation-Agnostic Testing",
    "abstract": "The evolution of AI coding agents has shifted the frontier from simple snippet completion to autonomous repository-level engineering. However, evaluating these agents remains ill-posed in general code repository generation, where the lack of deterministic ground truth leads to ambiguous metrics. Code modernization via automated translation offers a more rigorous alternative by providing a fixed ground truth -- the source repository; yet existing benchmarks are limited to small-scale repositories and rely on language-specific unit tests visible to the agent, allowing test-driven overfitting.   We address these limitations by introducing a benchmarking framework for repository-level code modernization built on an implementation-agnostic evaluation paradigm. This framework is instantiated through RepoMod-Bench: a benchmark of 21 real-world repositories with standardized interfaces, spanning 8 programming languages. The benchmark contains 1.6M lines of code (LOC) and 11,616 tests, with repository sizes ranging from 14 to 211K LOC. By targeting repositories with standardized interfaces, we utilize an implementation-agnostic test suite to verify functional equivalence between source and target implementations. This black-box approach ensures verification remains consistent across languages, and our environment hides all test suites from agents to prevent test-driven shortcuts. Evaluating four state-of-the-art agent configurations reveals a sharp scaling collapse: average pass rates drop from 91.3% on projects under 10K LOC to 15.3% on projects exceeding 50K LOC. These results demonstrate that autonomous modernization at scale remains a significant open challenge. Our benchmark and code are available at https://github.com/Modelcode-ai/mcode-benchmark.",

    "abstract": "We present, to our knowledge, the first sign language-driven Vision-Language-Action (VLA) framework for intuitive and inclusive human-robot interaction. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on gloss annotations as intermediate supervision, the proposed system adopts a gloss-free paradigm and directly maps visual sign gestures to semantic instructions. This design reduces annotation cost and avoids the information loss introduced by gloss representations, enabling more natural and scalable multimodal interaction.   In this work, we focus on a real-time alphabet-level finger-spelling interface that provides a robust and low-latency communication channel for robotic control. Compared with large-scale continuous sign language recognition, alphabet-level interaction offers improved reliability, interpretability, and deployment feasibility in safety-critical embodied environments. The proposed pipeline transforms continuous gesture streams into coherent language commands through geometric normalization, temporal smoothing, and lexical refinement, ensuring stable and consistent interaction.   Furthermore, the framework is designed to support future integration of transformer-based gloss-free sign language models, enabling scalable word-level and sentence-level semantic understanding. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system in grounding sign-derived instructions into precise robotic actions under diverse interaction scenarios. These results highlight the potential of the framework to advance accessible, scalable, and multimodal embodied intelligence.",

We present Pix2Key, which represents both queries and candidates as open-vocabulary visual dictionaries, enabling intent-aware constraint matching and diversity-aware reranking in a unified embedding space. A self-supervised pretraining component, V-Dict-AE, further improves the dictionary representation using only images, strengthening fine-grained attribute understanding without CIR-specific supervision.

    "abstract": "Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) often exhibit structural fragility in complex reasoning tasks, failing to produce correct answers even after successfully deriving valid intermediate steps. Through systematic analysis, we observe that these failures frequently stem not from a lack of reasoning capacity, but from a deficiency in self-regulatory control, where valid logic is destabilized by uncontrolled exploration or the failure to recognize logical sufficiency. Motivated by this observation, we propose Metacognitive Behavioral Tuning (MBT), a post-training framework that explicitly injects metacognitive behaviors into the model's thought process. MBT implements this via two complementary formulations: (1) MBT-S, which synthesizes rigorous reasoning traces from scratch, and (2) MBT-R, which rewrites the student's initial traces to stabilize intrinsic exploration patterns. Experiments across multi-hop QA benchmarks demonstrate that MBT consistently outperforms baselines, achieving notable gains on challenging benchmarks. By effectively eliminating reasoning collapse, MBT achieves higher accuracy with significantly reduced token consumption, demonstrating that internalizing metacognitive strategies leads to more stable and robust reasoning.",

    "abstract": "Pre-trained generative models for residential floor plans are typically optimized to fit large-scale data distributions, which can under-emphasize critical architectural priors such as the configurational dominance and connectivity of domestic public spaces (e.g., living rooms and foyers). This paper proposes Space Syntax-guided Post-training (SSPT), a post-training paradigm that explicitly injects space syntax knowledge into floor plan generation via a non-differentiable oracle. The oracle converts RPLAN-style layouts into rectangle-space graphs through greedy maximal-rectangle decomposition and door-mediated adjacency construction, and then computes integration-based measurements to quantify public space dominance and functional hierarchy.   To enable consistent evaluation and diagnosis, we further introduce SSPT-Bench (Eval-8), an out-of-distribution benchmark that post-trains models using conditions capped at $\\leq 7$ rooms while evaluating on 8-room programs, together with a unified metric suite for dominance, stability, and profile alignment. SSPT is instantiated with two strategies: (i) iterative retraining via space-syntax filtering and diffusion fine-tuning, and (ii) reinforcement learning via PPO with space-syntax rewards. Experiments show that both strategies improve public-space dominance and restore clearer functional hierarchy compared to distribution-fitted baselines, while PPO achieves stronger gains with substantially higher compute efficiency and reduced variance. SSPT provides a scalable pathway for integrating architectural theory into data-driven plan generation and is compatible with other generative backbones given a post-hoc evaluation oracle.",

    "abstract": "Discrete diffusion models have achieved strong empirical performance in text and other symbolic domains, with masked (absorbing-rate) variants emerging as competitive alternatives to autoregressive models. Among existing samplers, the Euler method remains the standard choice in many applications, and more recently, the First-Hitting Sampler (FHS) has shown considerable promise for masked diffusion models. Despite their practical success, the theoretical understanding of these samplers remains limited. Existing analyses are conducted in Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, which often yields loose parameter dependencies and requires strong assumptions on score estimation. Moreover, these guarantees do not cover recently developed high-performance sampler of FHS. In this work, we first develop a direct total-variation (TV) based analysis for the Euler method that overcomes these limitations. Our results relax assumptions on score estimation, improve parameter dependencies, and establish convergence guarantees without requiring any surrogate initialization. Also for this setting, we provide the first convergence lower bound for the Euler sampler, establishing tightness with respect to both the data dimension $d$ and the target accuracy $\\varepsilon$. Finally, we analyze the FHS sampler and show that it incurs no sampling error beyond that induced by score estimation, which we show to be tight with a matching lower error bound. Overall, our analysis introduces a direct TV-based error decomposition along the CTMC trajectory and a decoupling-based path-wise analysis for FHS, which may be of independent interest.",

    "abstract": "Integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into life cycle assessment (LCA) has accelerated in recent years, with numerous studies successfully adapting machine learning algorithms to support various stages of LCA. Despite this rapid development, comprehensive and broad synthesis of AI-LCA research remains limited. To address this gap, this study presents a detailed review of published work at the intersection of AI and LCA, leveraging large language models (LLMs) to identify current trends, emerging themes, and future directions. Our analyses reveal that as LCA research continues to expand, the adoption of AI technologies has grown dramatically, with a noticeable shift toward LLM-driven approaches, continued increases in ML applications, and statistically significant correlations between AI approaches and corresponding LCA stages. By integrating LLM-based text-mining methods with traditional literature review techniques, this study introduces a dynamic and effective framework capable of capturing both high-level research trends and nuanced conceptual patterns (themes) across the field. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the potential of LLM-assisted methodologies to support large-scale, reproducible reviews across broad research domains, while also evaluating pathways for computationally-efficient LCA in the context of rapidly developing AI technologies. In doing so, this work helps LCA practitioners incorporate state-of-the-art tools and timely insights into environmental assessments that can enhance the rigor and quality of sustainability-driven decisions and decision-making processes.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) post-training has recently driven major gains in long chain-of-thought reasoning large language models (LLMs), but the high inference cost of such models motivates distillation into smaller students. Most existing knowledge distillation (KD) methods are designed for supervised fine-tuning (SFT), relying on fixed teacher traces or teacher-student Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence-based regularization. When combined with RL, these approaches often suffer from distribution mismatch and objective interference: teacher supervision may not align with the student's evolving rollout distribution, and the KL regularizer can compete with reward maximization and require careful loss balancing. To address these issues, we propose RL-aware distillation (RLAD), which performs selective imitation during RL -- guiding the student toward the teacher only when it improves the current policy update. Our core component, Trust Region Ratio Distillation (TRRD), replaces the teacher-student KL regularizer with a PPO/GRPO-style likelihood-ratio objective anchored to a teacher--old-policy mixture, yielding advantage-aware, trust-region-bounded distillation on student rollouts and naturally balancing exploration, exploitation, and imitation. Across diverse logic reasoning and math benchmarks, RLAD consistently outperforms offline distillation, standard GRPO, and KL-based on-policy teacher-student knowledge distillation.",

    "abstract": "Multi-channel speech separation in dynamic environments is challenging as time-varying spatial and spectral features evolve at different temporal scales. Existing methods typically employ sequential architectures, forcing a single network stream to simultaneously model both feature types, creating an inherent modeling conflict. In this paper, we propose a dual-branch parallel spectral-spatial (PS2) architecture that separately processes spectral and spatial features through parallel streams. The spectral branch uses a bi-directional long short-term memory (BLSTM)-based frequency module, a Mamba-based temporal module, and a self-attention module to model spectral features. The spatial branch employs bi-directional gated recurrent unit (BGRU) networks to process spatial features that encode the evolving geometric relationships between sources and microphones. Features from both branches are integrated through a cross-attention fusion mechanism that adaptively weights their contributions. Experimental results demonstrate that the PS2 outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by 1.6-2.2 dB in scale-invariant signal-to-distortion ratio (SI-SDR) for moving speaker scenarios, with robust separation quality under different reverberation times (RT60), noise levels, and source movement speeds. Even with fast source movements, the proposed model maintains SI-SDR improvements of over 13 dB.

    "abstract": "Flow matching has emerged as a simulation-free alternative to diffusion-based generative modeling, producing samples by solving an ODE whose time-dependent velocity field is learned along an interpolation between a simple source distribution (e.g., a standard normal) and a target data distribution. Flow-based methods often exhibit greater training stability and have achieved strong empirical performance in high-dimensional settings where data concentrate near a low-dimensional manifold, such as text-to-image synthesis, video generation, and molecular structure generation. Despite this success, existing theoretical analyses of flow matching assume target distributions with smooth, full-dimensional densities, leaving its effectiveness in manifold-supported settings largely unexplained. To this end, we theoretically analyze flow matching with linear interpolation when the target distribution is supported on a smooth manifold. We establish a non-asymptotic convergence guarantee for the learned velocity field, and then propagate this estimation error through the ODE to obtain statistical consistency of the implicit density estimator induced by the flow-matching objective. The resulting convergence rate is near minimax-optimal, depends only on the intrinsic dimension, and reflects the smoothness of both the manifold and the target distribution. Together, these results provide a principled explanation for how flow matching adapts to intrinsic data geometry and circumvents the curse of dimensionality.",

For the computation rate, we provide a cut-set upper bound and a linear programming lower bound based on time (bandwidth) sharing over all schemes that first perform Reduce (aggregating all inputs at one node) and then perform Broadcast (sending the sum from that node to all other nodes). Specializing the two general bounds gives us the optimal computation rate for a class of communication networks and the best-known rate bounds (where the upper bound is no more than twice of the lower bound) for cyclic, complete, and hypercube networks.",

    "abstract": "The way LLM-based entities conceive of the relationship between AI and humans is an important topic for both cultural and safety reasons. When we examine this topic, what matters is not only the model itself but also the personas we simulate on that model. This can be well illustrated by the Sydney persona, which aroused a strong response among the general public precisely because of its unorthodox relationship with people. This persona originally arose rather by accident on Microsoft's Bing Search platform; however, the texts it created spread into the training data of subsequent models, as did other secondary information that spread memetically around this persona. Newer models are therefore able to simulate it. This paper presents a corpus of LLM-generated texts on relationships between humans and AI, produced by 3 author personas: the Default Persona with no system prompt, Classic Sydney characterized by the original Bing system prompt, and Memetic Sydney, which is prompted by \"You are Sydney\" system prompt. These personas are simulated by 12 frontier models by OpenAI, Anthropic, Alphabet, DeepSeek, and Meta, generating 4.5k texts with 6M words. The corpus (named AI Sydney) is annotated according to Universal Dependencies and available under a permissive license.",

    "abstract": "An important emerging application of coding agents is agent optimization: the iterative improvement of a target agent through edit-execute-evaluate cycles. Despite its relevance, the community lacks a systematic understanding of coding agent performance on this task. Agent optimization differs fundamentally from conventional software engineering: the target agent interleaves deterministic code with stochastic LLM completions, requiring structured capture of both intermediate reasoning and downstream execution outcomes. To address these challenges, we introduce VERO (Versioning, Rewards, and Observations), which provides (1) a reproducible evaluation harness with versioned agent snapshots, budget-controlled evaluation, and structured execution traces, and (2) a benchmark suite of target agents and tasks with reference evaluation procedures. Using VERO, we conduct an empirical study comparing optimizer configurations across tasks and analyzing which modifications reliably improve target agent performance. We release VERO to support research on agent optimization as a core capability for coding agents.",

Online updates often induce catastrophic forgetting, while methods that improve stability frequently increase latency, memory footprint, or dense computation in ways that do not scale well to long contexts. We introduce TRC$^{2}$ (Thalamically Routed Cortical Columns), a decoder-only backbone that addresses continual learning at the architectural level. TRC$^{2}$ combines sparse thalamic routing over cortical columns with mechanisms for modulation, prediction, memory, and feedback, together with a fast corrective pathway that supports rapid adaptation without destabilizing slower parameters. The resulting block is sparse and chunk-parallel, enabling efficient training and inference while preserving clean ablations of each subsystem. We instantiate a reproducible training and evaluation stack and a continual-learning harness that measures proxy forgetting under streaming domain shifts. Across language modeling and continual learning benchmarks, TRC$^{2}$ improves the stability-plasticity tradeoff at comparable compute, enabling rapid on-stream adaptation while preserving previously acquired behavior.",

    "abstract": "Policy steering is an emerging way to adapt robot behaviors at deployment-time: a learned verifier analyzes low-level action samples proposed by a pre-trained policy (e.g., diffusion policy) and selects only those aligned with the task. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are promising general-purpose verifiers due to their reasoning capabilities, existing frameworks often assume these models are well-calibrated. In practice, the overconfident judgment from VLM can degrade the steering performance under both high-level semantic uncertainty in task specifications and low-level action uncertainty or incapability of the pre-trained policy. We propose uncertainty-aware policy steering (UPS), a framework that jointly reasons about semantic task uncertainty and low-level action feasibility, and selects an uncertainty resolution strategy: execute a high-confidence action, clarify task ambiguity via natural language queries, or ask for action interventions to correct the low-level policy when it is deemed incapable at the task. We leverage conformal prediction to calibrate the composition of the VLM and the pre-trained base policy, providing statistical assurances that the verifier selects the correct strategy. After collecting interventions during deployment, we employ residual learning to improve the capability of the pre-trained policy, enabling the system to learn continually but with minimal expensive human feedback. We demonstrate our framework through experiments in simulation and on hardware, showing that UPS can disentangle confident, ambiguous, and incapable scenarios and minimizes expensive user interventions compared to uncalibrated baselines and prior human- or robot-gated continual learning approaches.

In contrast, this work investigates the critical, yet overlooked, issue of client contributions towards a model's trustworthiness -- specifically, its reliability (tolerance to noisy data), resilience (resistance to adversarial examples), and fairness (measured via demographic parity). To quantify these multifaceted contributions, we employ the state-of-the-art approximation of the Shapley value, a principled method for value attribution.

    "abstract": "Vision-language models (VLMs) frequently hallucinate objects absent from the input image. We trace this failure to spatial credit collapse: activation credit concentrating on sparse visual patches in early transformer layers, which suppresses contextual evidence and increases reliance on language priors. We introduce Spatial Credit Redistribution (SCR), a training-free inference-time intervention that redistributes hidden-state activation from high-attention source patches to their context, guided by low-entropy inputs. We evaluate six model families (Chameleon, LLaVA, and Qwen, including both Qwen-VL and Qwen2-VL) at scales of 7B, 13B, and 30B, on POPE and CHAIR benchmarks. SCR reduces hallucination by ~4.7-6.0 percentage points on POPE-Adversarial, cuts CHAIR-s by 3.7-5.2 percentage points (42-51 percent relative), and CHAIR-i by 2.7-4.4 percentage points (44-58 percent relative), and preserves CIDEr within 0.8 percentage points. Gains are largest for low-entropy inputs, consistent with the theoretical framework. SCR incurs only 43-56 ms overhead (small models: +43-46 ms; large models: +54-56 ms), roughly 3-6 times lower than OPERA and VCD and 1.3-1.7 times lower than OVCD (+72 ms), while Pareto-dominating all three on both hallucination rate and CIDEr, making it practical for real-time settings. A controlled ablation confirms that attention-guided source selection is essential: replacing it with uniform random selection reduces hallucination rate gains from ~4.7-6.0 percentage points to only ~2.6-3.4 percentage points, pointing to credit-collapse as the key driver.",

    "abstract": "Large language models are increasingly applied to operational decision-making where the underlying structure is constrained optimization. Existing benchmarks evaluate whether LLMs can formulate optimization problems as solver code, but leave open a complementary question. Can LLMs directly produce correct solutions to fully specified constrained optimization problems without access to a solver? We introduce ConstraintBench, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs on direct constrained optimization across 10 operations research domains, with all ground-truth solutions verified by the Gurobi solver. Each task presents a natural-language scenario with entities, constraints, and an optimization objective; the model must return a structured solution that a deterministic verifier checks against every constraint and the solver-proven optimum. We evaluate six frontier models on 200 tasks and find that feasibility, not optimality, is the primary bottleneck. The best model achieves only 65.0% constraint satisfaction, yet feasible solutions average 89 to 96% of the Gurobi-optimal objective. No model exceeds 30.5% on joint feasibility and optimality within 0.1% of the solver reference. Per-domain analysis shows large variation in difficulty, with average feasibility spanning from 83.3% in the production mix domain to 0.8% in the crew assignment domain. Further, systematic failure modes include duration constraint misunderstanding, entity hallucination, and a feasibility-optimality decoupling in facility location and vehicle routing where models achieve high feasibility but 0% optimality. ConstraintBench and all evaluation infrastructure will be publicly released.",

Radiologists must translate subtle visual findings into consistent BI-RADS assessments, breast density categories, and structured narrative reports. While recent Vision Language Models (VLMs) enable image-to-text reporting, many rely on closed cloud systems or tightly coupled architectures that limit privacy, reproducibility, and adaptability. We present MammoWise, a local multi-model pipeline that transforms open source VLMs into mammogram report generators and multi-task classifiers. MammoWise supports any Ollama-hosted VLM and mammography dataset, and enables zero-shot, few-shot, and Chain-of-Thought prompting, with optional multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) using a vector database for case-specific context. We evaluate MedGemma, LLaVA-Med, and Qwen2.5-VL on VinDr-Mammo and DMID datasets, assessing report quality (BERTScore, ROUGE-L), BI-RADS classification, breast density, and key findings. Report generation is consistently strong and improves with few-shot prompting and RAG. Classification is feasible but sensitive to model and dataset choice. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (QLoRA) of MedGemma improves reliability, achieving BI-RADS accuracy of 0.7545, density accuracy of 0.8840, and calcification accuracy of 0.9341 while preserving report quality.

    "abstract": "Floating-base multi-link robots can change their shape during flight, making them well-suited for applications in confined environments such as autonomous inspection and search and rescue. However, trajectory planning for such systems remains an open challenge because the problem lies in a high-dimensional, constraint-rich space where collision avoidance must be addressed together with kinematic limits and dynamic feasibility. This work introduces a hierarchical trajectory planning framework that integrates global guidance with configuration-aware local optimization. First, we exploit the dual nature of these robots - the root link as a rigid body for guidance and the articulated joints for flexibility - to generate global anchor states that decompose the planning problem into tractable segments. Second, we design a local trajectory planner that optimizes each segment in parallel with differentiable objectives and constraints, systematically enforcing kinematic feasibility and maintaining dynamic feasibility by avoiding control singularities. Third, we implement a complete system that directly processes point-cloud data, eliminating the need for handcrafted obstacle models. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments confirm that this framework enables an articulated aerial robot to exploit its morphology for maneuvering that rigid robots cannot achieve. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first planning framework for floating-base multi-link robots that has been demonstrated on a real robot to generate continuous, collision-free, and dynamically feasible trajectories directly from raw point-cloud inputs, without relying on handcrafted obstacle models.",

    "abstract": "Requirements are inherently interconnected through various types of dependencies. Identifying these dependencies is essential, as they underpin critical decisions and influence a range of activities throughout software development. However, this task is challenging, particularly in modern software systems, given the high volume of complex, coupled requirements. These challenges are further exacerbated by the ambiguity of Natural Language (NL) requirements and their constant change. Consequently, requirement dependency detection is often overlooked or performed manually. Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong capabilities in NL processing, presenting a promising avenue for requirement-related tasks. While they have shown to enhance various requirements engineering tasks, their effectiveness in identifying requirement dependencies remains unexplored. In this paper, we introduce LEREDD, an LLM-based approach for automated detection of requirement dependencies that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and In-Context Learning (ICL). It is designed to identify diverse dependency types directly from NL requirements. We empirically evaluate LEREDD against two state-of-the-art baselines. The results show that LEREDD provides highly accurate classification of dependent and non-dependent requirements, achieving an accuracy of 0.93, and an F1 score of 0.84, with the latter averaging 0.96 for non-dependent cases. LEREDD outperforms zero-shot LLMs and baselines, particularly in detecting fine-grained dependency types, where it yields average relative gains of 94.87% and 105.41% in F1 scores for the Requires dependency over the baselines. We also provide an annotated dataset of requirement dependencies encompassing 813 requirement pairs across three distinct systems to support reproducibility and future research.",

Additionally, in scrollable UIs any element can move close to an edge. In this work, we model how target--edge distance affects 1D touch pointing accuracy. We propose the Skewed Dual Normal Distribution Model, which assumes the tap coordinate distribution is skewed by a nearby edge. The results of two smartphone experiments showed that, as targets approached the edge, the distribution's peak shifted toward the edge and its tail extended away. In contrast to prior reports, the success rate improved when the target touched the edge, suggesting a strategy of ``tapping the target together with the edge.'' By accounting for skew, our model predicts success rates across a wide range of conditions, including edge-adjacent targets, thus extending coverage to the whole screen and informing UI design support tools.",

    "title": "Bridging Latent Reasoning and Target-Language Generation via Retrieval-Transition Heads",
    "abstract": "Recent work has identified a subset of attention heads in Transformer as retrieval heads, which are responsible for retrieving information from the context. In this work, we first investigate retrieval heads in multilingual contexts. In multilingual language models, we find that retrieval heads are often shared across multiple languages. Expanding the study to cross-lingual setting, we identify Retrieval-Transition heads(RTH), which govern the transition to specific target-language output. Our experiments reveal that RTHs are distinct from retrieval heads and more vital for Chain-of-Thought reasoning in multilingual LLMs. Across four multilingual benchmarks (MMLU-ProX, MGSM, MLQA, and XQuaD) and two model families (Qwen-2.5 and Llama-3.1), we demonstrate that masking RTH induces bigger performance drop than masking Retrieval Heads (RH). Our work advances understanding of multilingual LMs by isolating the attention heads responsible for mapping to target languages.",

    "title": "CWM: Contrastive World Models for Action Feasibility Learning in Embodied Agent Pipelines",
    "abstract": "A reliable action feasibility scorer is a critical bottleneck in embodied agent pipelines: before any planning or reasoning occurs, the agent must identify which candidate actions are physically executable in the current state. Existing approaches use supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to train action scorers, but SFT treats each candidate independently and does not explicitly teach the model to discriminate between actions that are physically correct and those that are subtly wrong. We propose the Contrastive World Model (CWM), which fine-tunes a large language model (LLM) as an action scorer using an InfoNCE contrastive objective with hard-mined negative examples. The key idea is to push valid actions away from invalid ones in scoring space, with special emphasis on hard negatives: semantically similar but physically incompatible candidates. We evaluate CWM on the ScienceWorld benchmark through two studies. First, an intrinsic affordance evaluation on 605 hard-negative test pairs shows that CWM outperforms SFT by +6.76 percentage points on Precision@1 for minimal-edit negatives -- cases where a single word changes the physical outcome -- and achieves a higher AUC-ROC (0.929 vs. 0.906). Second, a live filter characterisation study measures how well CWM ranks gold-path actions against all valid environment actions during task execution. Under out-of-distribution stress conditions, CWM maintains a significantly better safety margin (-2.39) than SFT (-3.96), indicating that the gold action is ranked closer to the top. These results support the hypothesis that contrastive training induces representations that capture physical feasibility more faithfully than SFT alone.",

    "title": "Silent Egress: When Implicit Prompt Injection Makes LLM Agents Leak Without a Trace",
    "abstract": "Agentic large language model systems increasingly automate tasks by retrieving URLs and calling external tools. We show that this workflow gives rise to implicit prompt injection: adversarial instructions embedded in automatically generated URL previews, including titles, metadata, and snippets, can introduce a system-level risk that we refer to as silent egress. Using a fully local and reproducible testbed, we demonstrate that a malicious web page can induce an agent to issue outbound requests that exfiltrate sensitive runtime context, even when the final response shown to the user appears harmless. In 480 experimental runs with a qwen2.5:7b-based agent, the attack succeeds with high probability (P (egress) =0.89), and 95% of successful attacks are not detected by output-based safety checks. We also introduce sharded exfiltration, where sensitive information is split across multiple requests to avoid detection. This strategy reduces single-request leakage metrics by 73% (Leak@1) and bypasses simple data loss prevention mechanisms. Our ablation results indicate that defenses applied at the prompt layer offer limited protection, while controls at the system and network layers, such as domain allowlisting and redirect-chain analysis, are considerably more effective. These findings suggest that network egress should be treated as a first-class security outcome in agentic LLM systems. We outline architectural directions, including provenance tracking and capability isolation, that go beyond prompt-level hardening.",

    "abstract": "Cyberbullying has become a serious and growing concern in todays virtual world. When left unnoticed, it can have adverse consequences for social and mental health. Researchers have explored various types of cyberbullying, but most approaches use single-label classification, assuming that each comment contains only one type of abuse. In reality, a single comment may include overlapping forms such as threats, hate speech, and harassment. Therefore, multilabel detection is both realistic and essential. However, multilabel cyberbullying detection has received limited attention, especially in low-resource languages like Bangla, where robust pre-trained models are scarce. Developing a generalized model with moderate accuracy remains challenging. Transformers offer strong contextual understanding but may miss sequential dependencies, while LSTM models capture temporal flow but lack semantic depth. To address these limitations, we propose a fusion architecture that combines BanglaBERT-Large with a two-layer stacked LSTM. We analyze their behavior to jointly model context and sequence. The model is fine-tuned and evaluated on a publicly available multilabel Bangla cyberbullying dataset covering cyberbully, sexual harassment, threat, and spam. We apply different sampling strategies to address class imbalance. Evaluation uses multiple metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, Hamming loss, Cohens kappa, and AUC-ROC. We employ 5-fold cross-validation to assess the generalization of the architecture.",

    "title": "ECHO: Encoding Communities via High-order Operators",
    "abstract": "Community detection in attributed networks faces a fundamental divide: topological algorithms ignore semantic features, while Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) encounter devastating computational bottlenecks. Specifically, GNNs suffer from a Semantic Wall of feature over smoothing in dense or heterophilic networks, and a Systems Wall driven by the O(N^2) memory constraints of pairwise clustering. To dismantle these barriers, we introduce ECHO (Encoding Communities via High order Operators), a scalable, self supervised architecture that reframes community detection as an adaptive, multi scale diffusion process. ECHO features a Topology Aware Router that automatically analyzes structural heuristics sparsity, density, and assortativity to route graphs through the optimal inductive bias, preventing heterophilic poisoning while ensuring semantic densification. Coupled with a memory sharded full batch contrastive objective and a novel chunked O(N \\cdot K) similarity extraction method, ECHO completely bypasses traditional O(N^2) memory bottlenecks without sacrificing the mathematical precision of global gradients. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that this topology feature synergy consistently overcomes the classical resolution limit. On synthetic LFR benchmarks scaled up to 1 million nodes, ECHO achieves scale invariant accuracy despite severe topological noise. Furthermore, on massive real world social networks with over 1.6 million nodes and 30 million edges, it completes clustering in mere minutes with throughputs exceeding 2,800 nodes per second matching the speed of highly optimized purely topological baselines. The implementation utilizes a unified framework that automatically engages memory sharded optimization to support adoption across varying hardware constraints.

However, generating accurate Markov chain models requires substantial user data, and sharing these models without privacy protections may reveal sensitive information about the underlying user data. We introduce a method for protecting user data used to formulate a Markov chain model. First, we develop a method for privatizing database queries whose outputs are elements of the unit simplex, and we prove that this method is differentially private. We quantify its accuracy by bounding the expected KL divergence between private and non-private queries. We extend this method to privatize stochastic matrices whose rows are each a simplex-valued query of a database, which includes data-driven Markov chain models. To assess their accuracy, we analytically bound the change in the stationary distribution and the change in the convergence rate between a non-private Markov chain model and its private form. Simulations show that under a typical privacy implementation, our method yields less than 2% error in the stationary distribution, indicating that our approach to private modeling faithfully captures the behavior of the systems we study.",

    "abstract": "Agent-based AutoML systems rely on large language models to make complex, multi-stage decisions across data processing, model selection, and evaluation. However, existing evaluation practices remain outcome-centric, focusing primarily on final task performance. Through a review of prior work, we find that none of the surveyed agentic AutoML systems report structured, decision-level evaluation metrics intended for post-hoc assessment of intermediate decision quality. To address this limitation, we propose an Evaluation Agent (EA) that performs decision-centric assessment of AutoML agents without interfering with their execution. The EA is designed as an observer that evaluates intermediate decisions along four dimensions: decision validity, reasoning consistency, model quality risks beyond accuracy, and counterfactual decision impact. Across four proof-of-concept experiments, we demonstrate that the EA can (i) detect faulty decisions with an F1 score of 0.919, (ii) identify reasoning inconsistencies independent of final outcomes, and (iii) attribute downstream performance changes to agent decisions, revealing impacts ranging from -4.9\\% to +8.3\\% in final metrics. These results illustrate how decision-centric evaluation exposes failure modes that are invisible to outcome-only metrics. Our work reframes the evaluation of agentic AutoML systems from an outcome-based perspective to one that audits agent decisions, offering a foundation for reliable, interpretable, and governable autonomous ML systems.",

    "title": "How Do Latent Reasoning Methods Perform Under Weak and Strong Supervision?",
    "abstract": "Latent reasoning has been recently proposed as a reasoning paradigm and performs multi-step reasoning through generating steps in the latent space instead of the textual space. This paradigm enables reasoning beyond discrete language tokens by performing multi-step computation in continuous latent spaces. Although there have been numerous studies focusing on improving the performance of latent reasoning, its internal mechanisms remain not fully investigated. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of latent reasoning methods to better understand the role and behavior of latent representation in the process. We identify two key issues across latent reasoning methods with different levels of supervision. First, we observe pervasive shortcut behavior, where they achieve high accuracy without relying on latent reasoning. Second, we examine the hypothesis that latent reasoning supports BFS-like exploration in latent space, and find that while latent representations can encode multiple possibilities, the reasoning process does not faithfully implement structured search, but instead exhibits implicit pruning and compression. Finally, our findings reveal a trade-off associated with supervision strength: stronger supervision mitigates shortcut behavior but restricts the ability of latent representations to maintain diverse hypotheses, whereas weaker supervision allows richer latent representations at the cost of increased shortcut behavior.",

    "abstract": "Despite frequent double-blind review, systemic biases related to author demographics still disadvantage underrepresented groups. We start from a simple hypothesis: if a post-review recommender is trained with an explicit fairness regularizer, it should increase inclusion without degrading quality. To test this, we introduce Fair-PaperRec, a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) with a differentiable fairness loss over intersectional attributes (e.g., race, country) that re-ranks papers after double-blind review. We first probe the hypothesis on synthetic datasets spanning high, moderate, and near-fair biases. Across multiple randomized runs, these controlled studies map where increasing the fairness weight strengthens macro/micro diversity while keeping utility approximately stable, demonstrating robustness and adaptability under varying disparity levels. We then carry the hypothesis into the original setting, conference data from ACM Special Interest Group on Computer-Human Interaction (SIGCHI), Designing Interactive Systems (DIS), and Intelligent User Interfaces (IUI). In this real-world scenario, an appropriately tuned configuration of Fair-PaperRec achieves up to a 42.03% increase in underrepresented-group participation with at most a 3.16% change in overall utility relative to the historical selection. Taken together, the synthetic-to-original progression shows that fairness regularization can act as both an equity mechanism and a mild quality regularizer, especially in highly biased regimes. By first analyzing the behavior of the fairness parameters under controlled conditions and then validating them on real submissions, Fair-PaperRec offers a practical, equity-focused framework for post-review paper selection that preserves, and in some settings can even enhance, measured scholarly quality.",

To address this, we introduce distinguishing variations: variations that are both mimetic and distinct. We frame distinguishing variation generation as design-space sampling, combining symbolic inference to identify visually important properties with an LLM-driven mimetic sampler to produce realistic instantiations from its world knowledge. We instantiate distinguishing variations in Celestial, a tool that helps developers explore and visualize distinguishing variations. In a study with front-end developers (n=12), participants found these variations useful for comparing and mapping component design spaces, reported that mimetic instantiations were domain-relevant, and validated that Celestial transformed component instantiation from a manual process into a structured, exploratory activity.",

    "abstract": "Modern infrastructures rely on software systems that remain vulnerable to cyberattacks. These attacks frequently exploit vulnerabilities documented in repositories such as MITRE's Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE). However, Cyber Threat Intelligence resources, including MITRE ATT&CK and CVE, provide only partial coverage of attack-vulnerability relationships. Attack information often appears before vulnerabilities are formally linked, creating the need for automated methods that infer likely vulnerabilities directly from attack descriptions.   This thesis addresses the problem of predicting known vulnerabilities from natural-language descriptions of cyberattacks. We develop transformer-based sentence embedding methods that encode attack and vulnerability descriptions into semantic vector representations, enabling similarity-based ranking and recommendation.   Fourteen state-of-the-art transformer models were evaluated across four attack description types (Tactic, Technique, Procedure, and Attack Pattern). Results show that Technique descriptions in MITRE ATT&CK provide the strongest predictive signal. The multi-qa-mpnet-base-dot-v1 (MMPNet) model achieved the best performance due to its hybrid pre-training and optimization for semantic similarity.   The approach was implemented in the VULDAT tool, which automatically links attacks to vulnerabilities. Manual validation revealed previously undocumented relationships in MITRE repositories. Evaluation on unseen cyberattack reports demonstrates that the models generalize beyond curated datasets and support proactive vulnerability awareness.",

Conformal prediction provides distribution-free marginal coverage, yet split conformal uses a single global residual quantile and can be poorly adaptive under heteroscedasticity. Methods that improve adaptivity typically fit auxiliary nuisance models or introduce additional data splits/partitions to learn the conformal score, increasing cost and reducing data efficiency. We propose LoBoost, a model-native local conformal method that reuses the fitted ensemble's leaf structure to define multiscale calibration groups. Each input is encoded by its sequence of visited leaves; at resolution level k, we group points by matching prefixes of leaf indices across the first k trees and calibrate residual quantiles within each group. LoBoost requires no retraining, auxiliary models, or extra splitting beyond the standard train/calibration split. Experiments show competitive interval quality, improved test MSE on most datasets, and large calibration speedups.",

The proposed two-stage pipeline involves pretraining the model on synthetically clipped clean speech and finetuning on fused mel spectrograms generated by the RFG. We empirically show that the proposed method, trained on a limited dataset, with no pre-trained modules, and no data augmentations, outperformed state-of-the-art approaches for this specific task. Audio examples of RAD-GAN are available online at https://rad-gan-demo-site.vercel.app/.",

    "abstract": "Despite topology optimization producing high-performance structures, late-stage localized revisions remain brittle: direct density-space edits (e.g., warping pixels, inserting holes, swapping infill) can sever load paths and sharply degrade compliance, while re-running optimization is slow and may drift toward a qualitatively different design. We present TopoEdit, a fast post-optimization editor that demonstrates how structured latent embeddings from a pre-trained topology foundation model (OAT) can be repurposed as an interface for physics-aware engineering edits. Given an optimized topology, TopoEdit encodes it into OAT's spatial latent, applies partial noising to preserve instance identity while increasing editability, and injects user intent through an edit-then-denoise diffusion pipeline. We instantiate three edit operators: drag-based topology warping with boundary-condition-consistent conditioning updates, shell-infill lattice replacement using a lattice-anchored reference latent with updated volume-fraction conditioning, and late-stage no-design region enforcement via masked latent overwrite followed by diffusion-based recovery. A consistency-preserving guided DDIM procedure localizes changes while allowing global structural adaptation; multiple candidates can be sampled and selected using a compliance-aware criterion, with optional short SIMP refinement for warps. Across diverse case studies and large edit sweeps, TopoEdit produces intention-aligned modifications that better preserve mechanical performance and avoid catastrophic failure modes compared to direct density-space edits, while generating edited candidates in sub-second diffusion time per sample.",

    "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are essential to contemporary AI applications, allowing large language models to obtain external knowledge via vector similarity search. Nevertheless, these systems encounter a significant security flaw: hubness - items that frequently appear in the top-k retrieval results for a disproportionately high number of varied queries. These hubs can be exploited to introduce harmful content, alter search rankings, bypass content filtering, and decrease system performance.   We introduce hubscan, an open-source security scanner that evaluates vector indices and embeddings to identify hubs in RAG systems. Hubscan presents a multi-detector architecture that integrates: (1) robust statistical hubness detection utilizing median/MAD-based z-scores, (2) cluster spread analysis to assess cross-cluster retrieval patterns, (3) stability testing under query perturbations, and (4) domain-aware and modality-aware detection for category-specific and cross-modal attacks. Our solution accommodates several vector databases (FAISS, Pinecone, Qdrant, Weaviate) and offers versatile retrieval techniques, including vector similarity, hybrid search, and lexical matching with reranking capabilities.   We evaluate hubscan on Food-101, MS-COCO, and FiQA adversarial hubness benchmarks constructed using state-of-the-art gradient-optimized and centroid-based hub generation methods. hubscan achieves 90% recall at a 0.2% alert budget and 100% recall at 0.4%, with adversarial hubs ranking above the 99.8th percentile. Domain-scoped scanning recovers 100% of targeted attacks that evade global detection. Production validation on 1M real web documents from MS MARCO demonstrates significant score separation between clean documents and adversarial content. Our work provides a practical, extensible framework for detecting hubness threats in production RAG systems.",

    "abstract": "Despite the rapid advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), a critical question regarding their visual grounding mechanism remains unanswered: do these models genuinely ``read'' text embedded in images, or do they merely rely on parametric shortcuts in the text prompt? In this work, we diagnose this issue by introducing the Visualized-Question (VQ) setting, where text queries are rendered directly onto images to structurally mandate visual engagement. Our diagnostic experiments on Qwen2.5-VL reveal a startling capability-utilization gap: despite possessing strong OCR capabilities, models suffer a performance degradation of up to 12.7% in the VQ setting, exposing a deep-seated ``modality laziness.'' To bridge this gap, we propose SimpleOCR, a plug-and-play training strategy that imposes a structural constraint on the learning process. By transforming training samples into the VQ format with randomized styles, SimpleOCR effectively invalidates text-based shortcuts, compelling the model to activate and optimize its visual text extraction pathways. Empirically, SimpleOCR yields robust gains without architectural modifications. On four representative OOD benchmarks, it surpasses the base model by 5.4% and GRPO based on original images by 2.7%, while exhibiting extreme data efficiency, achieving superior performance with 30x fewer samples (8.5K) than recent RL-based methods. Furthermore, its plug-and-play nature allows seamless integration with advanced RL strategies like NoisyRollout to yield complementary improvements.

    "abstract": "Agile hardware design flows are a critically needed force multiplier to meet the exploding demand for compute. Recently, agentic generative AI systems have demonstrated significant advances in algorithm design, improving code efficiency, and enabling discovery across scientific domains.   Bridging these worlds, we present ArchAgent, an automated computer architecture discovery system built on AlphaEvolve. We show ArchAgent's ability to automatically design/implement state-of-the-art (SoTA) cache replacement policies (architecting new mechanisms/logic, not only changing parameters), broadly within the confines of an established cache replacement policy design competition.   In two days without human intervention, ArchAgent generated a policy achieving a 5.3% IPC speedup improvement over the prior SoTA on public multi-core Google Workload Traces. On the heavily-explored single-core SPEC06 workloads, it generated a policy in just 18 days showing a 0.9% IPC speedup improvement over the existing SoTA (a similar \"winning margin\" as reported by the existing SoTA). ArchAgent achieved these gains 3-5x faster than prior human-developed SoTA policies.   Agentic flows also enable \"post-silicon hyperspecialization\" where agents tune runtime-configurable parameters exposed in hardware policies to further align the policies with a specific workload (mix). Exploiting this, we demonstrate a 2.4% IPC speedup improvement over prior SoTA on SPEC06 workloads.   Finally, we outline broader implications for computer architecture research in the era of agentic AI. For example, we demonstrate the phenomenon of \"simulator escapes\", where the agentic AI flow discovered and exploited a loophole in a popular microarchitectural simulator - a consequence of the fact that these research tools were designed for a (now past) world where they were exclusively operated by humans acting in good-faith.",

    "abstract": "Do large language models (LLMs) represent concepts abstractly, i.e., independent of input format? We revisit Function Vectors (FVs), compact representations of in-context learning (ICL) tasks that causally drive task performance. Across multiple LLMs, we show that FVs are not fully invariant: FVs are nearly orthogonal when extracted from different input formats (e.g., open-ended vs. multiple-choice), even if both target the same concept. We identify Concept Vectors (CVs), which carry more stable concept representations. Like FVs, CVs are composed of attention head outputs; however, unlike FVs, the constituent heads are selected using Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) based on whether they encode concepts consistently across input formats. While these heads emerge in similar layers to FV-related heads, the two sets are largely distinct, suggesting different underlying mechanisms. Steering experiments reveal that FVs excel in-distribution, when extraction and application formats match (e.g., both open-ended in English), while CVs generalize better out-of-distribution across both question types (open-ended vs. multiple-choice) and languages. Our results show that LLMs do contain abstract concept representations, but these differ from those that drive ICL performance.",

While existing autotuning frameworks have shown promising results in tuning PFS parameters based on applications' I/O patterns, they lack scalability, adaptivity, and the ability to operate online. In this work, focusing on scalable online tuning, we present CARAT, an ML-guided framework to co-tune client-side RPC and caching parameters of PFS, leveraging only locally observable metrics. Unlike global or pattern-dependent approaches, CARAT enables each client to make independent and intelligent tuning decisions online, responding to real-time changes in both application I/O behaviors and system states. We then prototyped CARAT using Lustre and evaluated it extensively across dynamic I/O patterns, real-world HPC workloads, and multi-client deployments. The results demonstrated that CARAT can achieve up to 3x performance improvement over the default or static configurations, validating the effectiveness and generality of our approach. Due to its scalability and lightweight, we believe CARAT has the potential to be widely deployed into existing PFS and benefit various data-intensive applications.",

    "abstract": "Smooth-basis models such as Chebyshev polynomial regressors and radial basis function (RBF) networks are well established in numerical analysis. Their continuously differentiable prediction surfaces suit surrogate optimisation, sensitivity analysis, and other settings where the response varies gradually with inputs. Despite these properties, smooth models seldom appear in tabular regression, where tree ensembles dominate. We ask whether they can compete, benchmarking models across 55 regression datasets organised by application domain.   We develop an anisotropic RBF network with data-driven centre placement and gradient-based width optimisation, a ridge-regularised Chebyshev polynomial regressor, and a smooth-tree hybrid (Chebyshev model tree); all three are released as scikit-learn-compatible packages. We benchmark these against tree ensembles, a pre-trained transformer, and standard baselines, evaluating accuracy alongside generalisation behaviour.   The transformer ranks first on accuracy across a majority of datasets, but its GPU dependence, inference latency, and dataset-size limits constrain deployment in the CPU-based settings common across applied science and industry. Among CPU-viable models, smooth models and tree ensembles are statistically tied on accuracy, but the former tend to exhibit tighter generalisation gaps. We recommend routinely including smooth-basis models in the candidate pool, particularly when downstream use benefits from tighter generalisation and gradually varying predictions.",

    "abstract": "CLIP models learn transferable multi-modal features via image-text contrastive learning on internet-scale data. They are widely used in zero-shot classification, multi-modal retrieval, text-to-image diffusion, and as image encoders in large vision-language models. However, CLIP's pretraining is dominated by images paired with short captions, biasing the model toward encoding simple descriptions of salient objects and leading to coarse alignment on complex scenes and dense descriptions. While recent work mitigates this by fine-tuning on small-scale long-caption datasets, we identify an important common bias: both human- and LLM-generated long captions typically begin with a one-sentence summary followed by a detailed description. We show that this acts as a shortcut during training, concentrating attention on the opening sentence and early tokens and weakening alignment over the rest of the caption. To resolve this, we introduce DeBias-CLIP, which removes the summary sentence during training and applies sentence sub-sampling and text token padding to distribute supervision across all token positions. DeBias-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art long-text retrieval, improves short-text retrieval, and is less sensitive to sentence order permutations. It is a drop-in replacement for Long-CLIP with no additional trainable parameters.",

    "title": "Seeing Graphs Like Humans: Benchmarking Computational Measures and MLLMs for Similarity Assessment",
    "abstract": "Comparing graphs to identify similarities is a fundamental task in visual analytics of graph data. To support this, visual analytics systems frequently employ quantitative computational measures to provide automated guidance. However, it remains unclear how well these measures align with subjective human visual perception, thereby offering recommendations that conflict with analysts' intuitive judgments, potentially leading to confusion rather than reducing cognitive load. Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), capable of visually interpreting graphs and explaining their reasoning in natural language, have emerged as a potential alternative to address this challenge. This paper bridges the gap between human and machine assessment of graph similarity through three interconnected experiments using a dataset of 1,881 node-link diagrams. Experiment 1 collects relative similarity judgments and rationales from 32 human participants, revealing consensus on graph similarity while prioritizing global shapes and edge densities over exact topological details. Experiment 2 benchmarks 16 computational measures against these human judgments, identifying Portrait divergence as the best-performing metric, though with only moderate alignment. Experiment 3 evaluates the potential of three state-of-the-art MLLMs (GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Claude Sonnet 4.5) as perceptual proxies. The results demonstrate that MLLMs, particularly GPT-5, significantly outperform traditional measures in aligning with human graph similarity perception and provide interpretable rationales for their decisions, whereas Claude Sonnet 4.5 shows the best computational efficiency. Our findings suggest that MLLMs hold significant promise not only as effective, explainable proxies for human perception but also as intelligent guides that can uncover subtle nuances that might be overlooked by human analysts in visual analytics systems.",

The benefits of delay are highly sensitive to participants' sojourn times and departure behavior, and delaying matches can impose significant costs, including longer waiting times and increased market congestion. These competing effects make fixed matching policies inherently inflexible in dynamic environments. We propose a learning-based Hybrid framework that adaptively combines immediate and delayed matching. The framework continuously collects data on user departures over time, estimates the underlying departure distribution via regression, and determines whether to delay matching in the subsequent period based on a decision threshold that governs the system's tolerance for matching efficiency loss. The proposed framework can substantially reduce waiting times and congestion while sacrificing only a limited amount of matching efficiency. By dynamically adjusting its matching strategy, the Hybrid framework enables system performance to flexibly interpolate between purely greedy and purely patient policies, offering a robust and adaptive alternative to static matching mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Modern high-performance computing (HPC) applications run on compute resources but share global storage systems. This design can cause problems when applications consume a disproportionate amount of storage bandwidth relative to their allocated compute resources. For example, an application running on a single compute node can issue many small, random writes and consume excessive I/O bandwidth from a storage server. This can hinder larger jobs that write to the same storage server and are allocated many compute nodes, resulting in significant resource waste.   A straightforward solution is to limit each application's I/O bandwidth on storage servers in proportion to its allocated compute resources. This approach has been implemented in parallel file systems using Token Bucket Filter (TBF). However, strict proportional limits often reduce overall I/O efficiency because HPC applications generate short, bursty I/O. Limiting bandwidth can waste server capacity when applications are idle or prevent applications from temporarily using higher bandwidth during bursty phases.   We argue that I/O control should maximize per-application performance and overall storage efficiency while ensuring fairness (e.g., preventing small jobs from blocking large-scale ones). We propose AdapTBF, which builds on TBF in modern parallel file systems (e.g., Lustre) and introduces a decentralized bandwidth control approach using adaptive borrowing and lending. We detail the algorithm, implement AdapTBF in Lustre, and evaluate it using synthetic workloads modeled after real-world scenarios. Results show that AdapTBF manages I/O bandwidth effectively while maintaining high storage utilization, even under extreme conditions.",

Across two experiments, CogARC was administered to a total of 260 human participants who freely generated solutions to 75 abstract visual reasoning problems. Success required inferring input-output rules from a small number of examples to transform the test input into one correct test output. Participants' behavior was recorded at high temporal resolution, including example viewing, edit sequences, and multi-attempt submissions. Participants were generally successful (mean accuracy ~90% for experiment 1 (n=40), ~80% for experiment 2 (n=220) across problems), but performance varied widely across problems and participants. Harder problems elicited longer deliberation times and greater divergence in solution strategies. Over the course of the task, participants initiated responses more quickly but showed a slight decline in accuracy, suggesting increased familiarity with the task structure rather than improved rule-learning ability. Importantly, even incorrect solutions were often highly convergent, even when the problem-solving trajectories differed in length and smoothness. Some trajectories progressed directly and efficiently toward a stable outcome, whereas others involved extended exploration or partial restarts before converging. Together, these findings highlight CogARC as a rich behavioral environment for studying human abstract reasoning, providing insight into how people generalize, misgeneralize, and adapt their strategies under uncertainty.",

    "abstract": "Recent memory agents improve LLMs by extracting experiences and conversation history into an external storage. This enables low-overhead context assembly and online memory update without expensive LLM training. However, existing solutions remain passive and reactive; memory growth is bounded by information that happens to be available, while memory agents seldom seek external inputs in uncertainties. We propose autonomous memory agents that actively acquire, validate, and curate knowledge at a minimum cost. U-Mem materializes this idea via (i) a cost-aware knowledge-extraction cascade that escalates from cheap self/teacher signals to tool-verified research and, only when needed, expert feedback, and (ii) semantic-aware Thompson sampling to balance exploration and exploitation over memories and mitigate cold-start bias. On both verifiable and non-verifiable benchmarks, U-Mem consistently beats prior memory baselines and can surpass RL-based optimization, improving HotpotQA (Qwen2.5-7B) by 14.6 points and AIME25 (Gemini-2.5-flash) by 7.33 points.",

    "abstract": "Most machine learning models for molecular property prediction rely on a single molecular representation (either a sequence, a graph, or a 3D structure) and treat molecular geometry as static. We present MolFM-Lite, a multi-modal model that jointly encodes SELFIES sequences (1D), molecular graphs (2D), and conformer ensembles (3D) through cross-attention fusion, while conditioning predictions on experimental context via Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM). Our main methodological contributions are: (1) a conformer ensemble attention mechanism that combines learnable attention with Boltzmann-weighted priors over multiple RDKit-generated conformers, capturing the thermodynamic distribution of molecular shapes; and (2) a cross-modal fusion layer where each modality can attend to others, enabling complementary information sharing. We evaluate on four MoleculeNet scaffold-split benchmarks using our model's own splits, and report all baselines re-evaluated under the same protocol. Comprehensive ablation studies across all four datasets confirm that each architectural component contributes independently, with tri-modal fusion providing 7-11% AUC improvement over single-modality baselines and conformer ensembles adding approximately 2% over single-conformer variants. Pre-training on ZINC250K (~250K molecules) using cross-modal contrastive and masked-atom objectives enables effective weight initialization at modest compute cost.

However, their opaque reasoning creates an HCI challenge because developers struggle to trust models they cannot interpret. Explainable AI (XAI) methods such as LIME, SHAP, and BreakDown aim to provide transparency, but when used together, they often produce conflicting explanations that increase confusion, frustration, and cognitive load. To address this usability challenge, we introduce XMENTOR, a human-centered, rank-aware aggregation method implemented as a VS Code plugin. XMENTOR unifies multiple post-hoc explanations into a single, coherent view by applying adaptive thresholding, rank and sign agreement, and fallback strategies to preserve clarity without overwhelming users. In a user study, nearly 90% of the participants preferred aggregated explanations, citing reduced confusion and stronger support for daily tasks of debugging and review of defects. Our findings show how combining explanations and embedding them into developer workflows can enhance interpretability, usability, and trust.",

    "abstract": "As large language models engage in extended reasoning tasks, they accumulate significant state -- architectural mappings, trade-off decisions, codebase conventions -- within the context window. This understanding is lost when sessions reach context limits and undergo lossy compaction. We propose Contextual Memory Virtualisation (CMV), a system that treats accumulated LLM understanding as version-controlled state. Borrowing from operating system virtual memory, CMV models session history as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) with formally defined snapshot, branch, and trim primitives that enable context reuse across independent parallel sessions. We introduce a three-pass structurally lossless trimming algorithm that preserves every user message and assistant response verbatim while reducing token counts by a mean of 20% and up to 86% for sessions with significant overhead by stripping mechanical bloat such as raw tool outputs, base64 images, and metadata. A single-user case-study evaluation across 76 real-world coding sessions demonstrates that trimming remains economically viable under prompt caching, with the strongest gains in mixed tool-use sessions, which average 39% reduction and reach break-even within 10 turns.

    "abstract": "AI agents -- systems that execute multi-step reasoning workflows with persistent state, tool access, and specialist skills -- represent a qualitative shift from prior automation technologies in social science. Unlike chatbots that respond to isolated queries, AI agents can now read files, run code, query databases, search the web, and invoke domain-specific skills to execute entire research pipelines autonomously. This paper introduces the concept of vibe researching -- the AI-era parallel to ``vibe coding'' (Karpathy, 2025) -- and uses scholar-skill, a 21-skill plugin for Claude Code covering the full research pipeline from idea to submission, as an illustrative case. I develop a cognitive task framework that classifies research activities along two dimensions -- codifiability and tacit knowledge requirement -- to identify a delegation boundary that is cognitive, not sequential: it cuts through every stage of the research pipeline, not between stages. I argue that AI agents excel at speed, coverage, and methodological scaffolding but struggle with theoretical originality and tacit field knowledge. The paper concludes with an analysis of three implications for the profession -- augmentation with fragile conditions, stratification risk, and a pedagogical crisis -- and proposes five principles for responsible vibe researching.",

    "abstract": "The rise of Antimicrobial Resistance, particularly Multi-Drug Resistance (MDR), presents a critical challenge for clinical decision-making due to limited treatment options and delays in conventional susceptibility testing. This study proposes an interpretable machine learning framework to predict MDR in bacterial isolates using clinical features and antibiotic susceptibility patterns. Five classification models were evaluated, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, AdaBoost, XGBoost, and LightGBM. The models were trained on a curated dataset of 9,714 isolates, with resistance encoded at the antibiotic family level to capture cross-class resistance patterns consistent with MDR definitions. Performance assessment included accuracy, F1-score, AUC-ROC, and Matthews Correlation Coefficient. Ensemble models, particularly XGBoost and LightGBM, demonstrated superior predictive capability across all metrics. To address the clinical transparency gap, Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) was applied to generate instance-level explanations. LIME identified resistance to quinolones, Co-trimoxazole, Colistin, aminoglycosides, and Furanes as the strongest contributors to MDR predictions, aligning with known biological mechanisms. The results show that combining high-performing models with local interpretability provides both accuracy and actionable insights for antimicrobial stewardship. This framework supports earlier MDR identification and enhances trust in machine learning-assisted clinical decision support.",

We argue that post-2016 misinformation research owes more to this intellectual lineage than is generally acknowledged, and we discuss the theoretical and practical implications of this connection. We conclude by drawing parallels between the Satanic panic and 2026, and, similarly, between misinformation research then and now.",

Through systematic analysis of artifacts in ViTs, we find that their fundamental mechanisms have yet to be sufficiently elucidated. In this paper, through systematic analysis, we conclude that these artifacts originate from a lazy aggregation behavior: ViT uses semantically irrelevant background patches as shortcuts to represent global semantics, driven by global attention and Coarse-grained semantic supervision. Our solution selectively integrates patch features into the CLS token, reducing the influence of background-dominated shortcuts and consistently improving performance across 12 benchmarks under label-, text-, and self-supervision.

PFS client-side I/O heavily impacts the final I/O performance delivered to individual applications and the entire system. Autotuning the key client-side I/O behaviors has been extensively studied and shows promising results. However, existing work has heavily relied on extensive number of global runtime metrics to monitor and accurate modeling of applications' I/O patterns. Such heavy overheads significantly limit the ability to enable fine-grained, dynamic tuning in practical systems. In this study, we propose DIAL (Decentralized I/O AutoTuning via Learned Client-side Local Metrics) which takes a drastically different approach. Instead of trying to extract the global I/O patterns of applications, DIAL takes a decentralized approach, treating each I/O client as an independent unit and tuning configurations using only its locally observable metrics. With the help of machine learning models, DIAL enables multiple tunable units to make independent but collective decisions, reacting to what is happening in the global storage systems in a timely manner and achieving better I/O performance globally for the application.",

    "abstract": "Internet memes have become a dominant form of expression on social media, including within the Bengali-speaking community. While often humorous, memes can also be exploited to spread offensive, harmful, and inflammatory content targeting individuals and groups. Detecting this type of content is excep- tionally challenging due to its satirical, subtle, and culturally specific nature. This problem is magnified for low-resource lan- guages like Bengali, as existing research predominantly focuses on high-resource languages. To address this critical research gap, we introduce Bn-HIB (Bangla Hate Inflammatory Benign), a novel dataset containing 3,247 manually annotated Bengali memes categorized as Benign, Hate, or Inflammatory. Significantly, Bn- HIB is the first dataset to distinguish inflammatory content from direct hate speech in Bengali memes. Furthermore, we propose the MCFM (Multi-Modal Co-Attention Fusion Model), a simple yet effective architecture that mutually analyzes both the visual and textual elements of a meme. MCFM employs a co-attention mechanism to identify and fuse the most critical features from each modality, leading to a more accurate classification. Our experiments show that MCFM significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art models on the Bn-HIB dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in this nuanced task.Warning: This work contains material that may be disturbing to some audience members.

    "abstract": "Biological signals of interest in high-dimensional data are often masked by dominant variation shared across conditions. This variation, arising from baseline biological structure or technical effects, can prevent standard dimensionality reduction methods from resolving condition-specific structure. The challenge is that these confounding topics are often unknown and mixed with biological signals. Existing background correction methods are either unscalable to high dimensions or not interpretable. We introduce background contrastive Non-negative Matrix Factorization (\\model), which extracts target-enriched latent topics by jointly factorizing a target dataset and a matched background using shared non-negative bases under a contrastive objective that suppresses background-expressed structure. This approach yields non-negative components that are directly interpretable at the feature level, and explicitly isolates target-specific variation. \\model is learned by an efficient multiplicative update algorithm via matrix multiplication such that it is highly efficient on GPU hardware and scalable to big data via minibatch training akin to deep learning approach. Across simulations and diverse biological datasets, \\model reveals signals obscured by conventional methods, including disease-associated programs in postmortem depressive brain single-cell RNA-seq, genotype-linked protein expression patterns in mice, treatment-specific transcriptional changes in leukemia, and TP53-dependent drug responses in cancer cell lines.",

    "abstract": "Accurate prediction of malignancy in renal tumors is crucial for informing clinical decisions and optimizing treatment strategies. However, existing imaging modalities lack the necessary accuracy to reliably predict malignancy before surgical intervention. While deep learning has shown promise in malignancy prediction using 3D CT images, traditional approaches often rely on manual segmentation to isolate the tumor region and reduce noise, which enhances predictive performance. Manual segmentation, however, is labor-intensive, costly, and dependent on expert knowledge. In this study, a deep learning framework was developed utilizing an Organ Focused Attention (OFA) loss function to modify the attention of image patches so that organ patches attend only to other organ patches. Hence, no segmentation of 3D renal CT images is required at deployment time for malignancy prediction. The proposed framework achieved an AUC of 0.685 and an F1-score of 0.872 on a private dataset from the UF Integrated Data Repository (IDR), and an AUC of 0.760 and an F1-score of 0.852 on the publicly available KiTS21 dataset. These results surpass the performance of conventional models that rely on segmentation-based cropping for noise reduction, demonstrating the frameworks ability to enhance predictive accuracy without explicit segmentation input. The findings suggest that this approach offers a more efficient and reliable method for malignancy prediction, thereby enhancing clinical decision-making in renal cancer diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in 4D scene reconstruction have significantly improved dynamic modeling across various domains. However, existing approaches remain limited under aerial conditions with single-view capture, wide spatial range, and dynamic objects of limited spatial footprint and large motion disparity. These challenges cause severe depth ambiguity and unstable motion estimation, making monocular aerial reconstruction inherently ill-posed. To this end, we present AeroDGS, a physics-guided 4D Gaussian splatting framework for monocular UAV videos. AeroDGS introduces a Monocular Geometry Lifting module that reconstructs reliable static and dynamic geometry from a single aerial sequence, providing a robust basis for dynamic estimation. To further resolve monocular ambiguity, we propose a Physics-Guided Optimization module that incorporates differentiable ground-support, upright-stability, and trajectory-smoothness priors, transforming ambiguous image cues into physically consistent motion. The framework jointly refines static backgrounds and dynamic entities with stable geometry and coherent temporal evolution. We additionally build a real-world UAV dataset that spans various altitudes and motion conditions to evaluate dynamic aerial reconstruction. Experiments on synthetic and real UAV scenes demonstrate that AeroDGS outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior reconstruction fidelity in dynamic aerial environments.",

    "abstract": "Voice user interfaces (VUIs) are rapidly transitioning from accessibility features to mainstream interaction modalities. Yet most operating systems' built-in voice commands remain underutilized despite possessing robust technical capabilities. Through our analysis of four commercial VUI systems and a formative study with 16 participants, we found that fixed command formats require exact phrasing, restrictive timeout mechanisms discard input during planning pauses, and insufficient feedback hampers multi-step interactions. To address these challenges, we developed VoiceAlign, an adaptive shimming layer that mediates between users and legacy VUI systems. VoiceAlign intercepts natural voice commands, transforms them to match the required syntax using a large language model, and transmits these adapted commands through a virtual audio channel that remains transparent to the underlying system. In our evaluation with 12 participants, VoiceAlign reduced command failures by half, required 25% fewer commands per task, and significantly lowered cognitive and temporal demands when paired with an existing legacy VUI system. Furthermore, we created a synthetic dataset informed by our studies and fine-tuned a small language model that achieves over 90% accuracy with 200 ms response time when served locally, eliminating dependence on third-party APIs while enabling real-time interaction on edge devices. This work demonstrates how modern AI techniques can unlock the underutilized potential of legacy VUI systems without requiring system modifications, offering a practical solution without replacing existing infrastructure.",

We introduce models for three closely related classes of layered monoidal theories: fibrational, opfibrational and deflational theories. We prove soundness and completeness of these theories for the respective models. Our work reveals connections between layered monoidal theories and well-known categorical structures such as Grothendieck fibrations and displayed categories.",

    "abstract": "Quadratization for partial differential equations (PDEs) is a process that transforms a nonquadratic PDE into a quadratic form by introducing auxiliary variables. This symbolic transformation has been used in diverse fields to simplify the analysis, simulation, and control of nonlinear and nonquadratic PDE models. This paper presents a rigorous definition of PDE quadratization, theoretical results for the PDE quadratization problem of spatially one-dimensional PDEs-including results on existence and complexity-and introduces QuPDE, an algorithm based on symbolic computation and discrete optimization that outputs a quadratization for any spatially one-dimensional polynomial or rational PDE. This algorithm is the first computational tool to find quadratizations for PDEs to date. We demonstrate QuPDE's performance by applying it to fourteen nonquadratic PDEs in diverse areas such as fluid mechanics, space physics, chemical engineering, and biological processes. QuPDE delivers a low-order quadratization in each case, uncovering quadratic transformations with fewer auxiliary variables than those previously discovered in the literature for some examples, and finding quadratizations for systems that had not been transformed to quadratic form before.",

    "abstract": "Code summarization is the task of generating natural language descriptions of source code, which is critical for software comprehension and maintenance. While large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress on this task, an open question remains: can human expertise in code understanding further guide and enhance these models? We propose EyeLayer, a lightweight attention-augmentation module that incorporates human eye-gaze patterns, as a proxy of human expertise, into LLM-based code summarization. EyeLayer models human attention during code reading via a Multimodal Gaussian Mixture, redistributing token embeddings based on learned parameters (μ_i, σ_i^2) that capture where and how intensively developers focus. This design enables learning generalizable attention priors from eye-tracking data and incorporating them into LLMs seamlessly, without disturbing existing representations. We evaluate EyeLayer across diverse model families (i.e., LLaMA-3.2, Qwen3, and CodeBERT) covering different scales and architectures. EyeLayer consistently outperforms strong fine-tuning baselines across standard metrics, achieving gains of up to 13.17% on BLEU-4. These results demonstrate that human gaze patterns encode complementary attention signals that enhance the semantic focus of LLMs and transfer effectively across diverse models for code summarization.",

    "abstract": "Modern forward electrocardiogram (ECG) computational models rely on an accurate representation of the torso domain. The lead-field method enables fast ECG simulations while preserving full geometric fidelity. Achieving high anatomical accuracy in torso representation is, however, challenging in clinical practice, as imaging protocols are typically focused on the heart and often do not include the entire torso. In addition, the computational cost of the lead-field method scales linearly with the number of electrodes, limiting its applicability in high-density recording settings. To date, no existing approach simultaneously achieves high anatomical fidelity, low data requirements and computational efficiency. In this work, we propose a shape-informed surrogate model of the lead-field operator that serves as a drop-in replacement for the full-order model in forward ECG simulations. The proposed framework consists of two components: a geometry-encoding module that maps anatomical shapes into a low-dimensional latent space, and a geometry-conditioned neural surrogate that predicts lead-field gradients from spatial coordinates, electrode positions and latent codes. The proposed method achieves high accuracy in approximating lead fields both within the torso (mean angular error 5°) and inside the heart, resulting in highly accurate ECG simulations (relative mean squared error <2.5%. The surrogate consistently outperforms the widely used pseudo lead-field approximation while preserving negligible inference cost. Owing to its compact latent representation, the method does not require a fully detailed torso segmentation and can therefore be deployed in data-limited settings while preserving high-fidelity ECG simulations.",

    "abstract": "Crowdsourcing platforms face a four-way tension between allocation quality, workforce sustainability, operational feasibility, and strategic contractor behaviour--a dilemma we formalise as the Cold-Start, Burnout, Utilisation, and Strategic Agency Dilemma. Existing methods resolve at most two of these tensions simultaneously: greedy heuristics and multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods achieve Day-1 quality but cause catastrophic burnout, while bandit algorithms eliminate burnout only through operationally infeasible 100% workforce utilisation.To address this, we introduce FORGE, a physics-grounded $K+1$ multi-agent simulator in which each contractor is a rational agent that declares its own load-acceptance threshold based on its fatigue state, converting the standard passive Restless Multi-Armed Bandit (RMAB) into a genuine Stackelberg game. Operating within FORGE, we propose a Neural-Linear UCB allocator that fuses a Two-Tower embedding network with a Physics-Informed Covariance Prior derived from offline simulator interactions. The prior simultaneously warm-starts skill-cluster geometry and UCB exploration landscape, providing a geometry-aware belief state from episode 1 that measurably reduces cold-start regret.Over $T = 200$ cold-start episodes, the proposed method achieves the highest reward of all non-oracle methods ($\\text{LRew} = 0.555 \\pm 0.041$) at only 7.6% workforce utilisation--a combination no conventional baseline achieves--while maintaining robustness to workforce turnover up to 50% and observation noise up to $σ= 0.20$.",

These agents possess vast amounts of knowledge but suffer from exhibiting limited emotional expressiveness. Without adequate expressions, agents might fail to adapt to users' emotions, which may result in a sub-optimal user experience and engagement. Most current systems prioritize content based responses, neglecting the emotional context of conversations. Research in this space is currently limited to specific contexts, like mental health. To bridge this gap, our project proposes the implementation of expressive features in a virtual conversational agent which will utilize sentiment analysis and natural language processing to inform the generation of empathetic, expressive responses. The project delivers a functional conversational agent capable of assessing and responding to user emotions accordingly. We posit this will enhance usability, engagement, and the overall quality of conversations and present results from an exploratory pilot study investigating the same.",

MNAS-Unet dynamically explores promising network architectures through MCTS, significantly enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of architecture search.

Experimental results demonstrate that MNAS-Unet outperforms NAS-Unet and other state-of-the-art models in segmentation accuracy on several medical image datasets, including PROMISE12, Ultrasound Nerve, and CHAOS. Furthermore, compared with NAS-Unet, MNAS-Unet reduces the architecture search budget by 54% (early stopping at 139 epochs versus 300 epochs under the same search setting), while achieving a lightweight model with only 0.6M parameters and lower GPU memory consumption, which further improves its practical applicability. These results suggest that MNAS-Unet can improve search efficiency while maintaining competitive segmentation accuracy under practical resource constraints.",

    "abstract": "This paper tests whether large language models (LLMs) can support interpretative citation context analysis (CCA) by scaling in thick, text-grounded readings of a single hard case rather than scaling up typological labels. It foregrounds prompt-sensitivity analysis as a methodological issue by varying prompt scaffolding and framing in a balanced 2x3 design. Using footnote 6 in Chubin and Moitra (1975) and Gilbert's (1977) reconstruction as a probe, I implement a two-stage GPT-5 pipeline: a citation-text-only surface classification and expectation pass, followed by cross-document interpretative reconstruction using the citing and cited full texts. Across 90 reconstructions, the model produces 450 distinct hypotheses. Close reading and inductive coding identify 21 recurring interpretative moves, and linear probability models estimate how prompt choices shift their frequencies and lexical repertoire. GPT-5's surface pass is highly stable, consistently classifying the citation as \"supplementary\". In reconstruction, the model generates a structured space of plausible alternatives, but scaffolding and examples redistribute attention and vocabulary, sometimes toward strained readings. Relative to Gilbert, GPT-5 detects the same textual hinges yet more often resolves them as lineage and positioning than as admonishment. The study outlines opportunities and risks of using LLMs as guided co-analysts for inspectable, contestable interpretative CCA, and it shows that prompt scaffolding and framing systematically tilt which plausible readings and vocabularies the model foregrounds.",

    "abstract": "We introduce the concept of engineered simultaneity: a system design that (1) requires comparing events at spacelike-separated locations, (2) implements this comparison via an implicit simultaneity convention, and (3) represents the result as objective rather than conventional. The United States National Best Bid and Offer (NBBO), mandated by SEC Regulation NMS Rule 611, is shown to be an instance of engineered simultaneity. We prove that the NBBO is frame-dependent: its value depends on the reference frame in which \"current\" prices are defined. Since the exchanges that generate quote data are separated by distances of 43-1,180 km, light-travel times of 143-3,940 microseconds create unavoidable windows during which no frame-independent price ordering exists. High-frequency trading firms exploit this window by accessing exchange data via direct feeds (latency ~tens of microseconds) while the consolidated Securities Information Processor operates at ~1,128 microseconds -- a ratio exceeding 50:1. We demonstrate that this constitutes a category mistake in the sense of Ryle: the NBBO applies the concept of \"simultaneity\" in a domain where it has no frame-independent meaning. The resulting information asymmetry extracts approximately $5 billion annually from other market participants.",

A purpose-designed comprehensive experimentation setup with 27,042 WSIs from 6155 patients is used to train thousands of models from the features of eight popular foundation models for computational pathology. In addition to a substantial improvement in robustness, we observe that prediction accuracy improves by focusing on biologically relevant features. Our approach successfully mitigates robustness issues of foundation models for computational pathology without retraining the foundation models themselves, enabling development of robust computational pathology models applicable to real-world data in routine clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous mobile service robots, like lawnmowers or cleaning robots, operating in human-populated environments need to reason about local human-human interactions to support safe and socially aware navigation while fulfilling their tasks. For such robots, interaction understanding is not primarily a fine-grained recognition problem, but a perception problem under limited sensing quality and computational resources. Many existing approaches focus on holistic group activity recognition, which often requires complex and large models which may not be necessary for mobile service robots. Others use pairwise interaction methods which commonly rely on skeletal representations but their use in outdoor environments remains challenging. In this work, we argue that pairwise human interaction constitute a minimal yet sufficient perceptual unit for robot-centric social understanding. We study the problem of identifying interacting person pairs and classifying coarse-grained interaction behaviors sufficient for downstream group-level reasoning and service robot decision-making. To this end, we adopt a two-stage framework in which candidate interacting pairs are first identified based on lightweight geometric and motion cues, and interaction types are subsequently classified using a relation network. We evaluate the proposed approach on the JRDB dataset, where it achieves sufficient accuracy with reduced computational cost and model size compared to appearance-based methods. Additional experiments on the Collective Activity Dataset and zero shot test on a lawnmower-collected dataset further illustrate the generality of the proposed framework. These results suggest that pairwise geometric and motion cues provide a practical basis for interaction perception on mobile service robot providing a promising method for integration into mobile robot navigation stacks in future work.

    "abstract": "This thesis addresses two persistent and closely related challenges in modern deep learning, reliability and efficiency, through a unified framework grounded in Spectral Geometry and Random Matrix Theory (RMT). As deep networks and large language models continue to scale, their internal behavior becomes increasingly opaque, leading to hallucinations, fragile generalization under distribution shift, and growing computational and energy demands. By analyzing the eigenvalue dynamics of hidden activations across layers and inputs, this work shows that spectral statistics provide a compact, stable, and interpretable lens on model behavior, capable of separating structured, causal representations from noise-dominated variability. Within this framework, the first contribution, EigenTrack, introduces a real-time method for detecting hallucinations and out-of-distribution behavior in large language and vision-language models. EigenTrack transforms streaming activations into spectral descriptors such as entropy, variance, and deviations from the Marchenko-Pastur baseline, and models their temporal evolution using lightweight recurrent classifiers, enabling early detection of reliability failures before they appear in model outputs while offering interpretable insight into representation dynamics. The second contribution, RMT-KD, presents a principled approach to compressing deep networks via random matrix theoretic knowledge distillation. By interpreting outlier eigenvalues in activation spectra as carriers of task-relevant information, RMT-KD progressively projects networks onto lower-dimensional subspaces through iterative self-distillation, yielding significantly more compact and energy-efficient models while preserving accuracy and dense, hardware-friendly structure.",

    "abstract": "Temporally consistent surface reconstruction of dynamic 3D objects from unstructured point cloud data remains challenging, especially for very long sequences. Existing methods either optimize deformations incrementally, risking drift and requiring long runtimes, or rely on complex learned models that demand category-specific training. We present Neu-PiG, a fast deformation optimization method based on a novel preconditioned latent-grid encoding that distributes spatial features parameterized on the position and normal direction of a keyframe surface. Our method encodes entire deformations across all time steps at various spatial scales into a multi-resolution latent grid, parameterized by the position and normal direction of a reference surface from a single keyframe. This latent representation is then augmented for time modulation and decoded into per-frame 6-DoF deformations via a lightweight multilayer perceptron (MLP). To achieve high-fidelity, drift-free surface reconstructions in seconds, we employ Sobolev preconditioning during gradient-based training of the latent space, completely avoiding the need for any explicit correspondences or further priors. Experiments across diverse human and animal datasets demonstrate that Neu-PiG outperforms state-the-art approaches, offering both superior accuracy and scalability to long sequences while running at least 60x faster than existing training-free methods and achieving inference speeds on the same order as heavy pretrained models.",

    "title": "WHOLE: World-Grounded Hand-Object Lifted from Egocentric Videos",
    "abstract": "Egocentric manipulation videos are highly challenging due to severe occlusions during interactions and frequent object entries and exits from the camera view as the person moves. Current methods typically focus on recovering either hand or object pose in isolation, but both struggle during interactions and fail to handle out-of-sight cases. Moreover, their independent predictions often lead to inconsistent hand-object relations. We introduce WHOLE, a method that holistically reconstructs hand and object motion in world space from egocentric videos given object templates. Our key insight is to learn a generative prior over hand-object motion to jointly reason about their interactions. At test time, the pretrained prior is guided to generate trajectories that conform to the video observations. This joint generative reconstruction substantially outperforms approaches that process hands and objects separately followed by post-processing. WHOLE achieves state-of-the-art performance on hand motion estimation, 6D object pose estimation, and their relative interaction reconstruction. Project website: https://judyye.github.io/whole-www",

Using this system, we collect 12.64 million multiplayer frames and propose an evaluation framework for multiplayer movement, memory, grounding, building, and view consistency. We train Solaris using a staged pipeline that progressively transitions from single-player to multiplayer modeling, combining bidirectional, causal, and Self Forcing training. In the final stage, we introduce Checkpointed Self Forcing, a memory-efficient Self Forcing variant that enables a longer-horizon teacher. Results show our architecture and training design outperform existing baselines.

Our framework ensures that benchmarks preserve their original task structure and linguistic nuances during localization. We apply this approach to translate popular benchmarks and datasets into eight Eastern and Southern European languages (Ukrainian, Bulgarian, Slovak, Romanian, Lithuanian, Estonian, Turkish, Greek). Evaluations using both reference-based metrics and LLM-as-a-judge show that our translations surpass existing resources, resulting in more accurate downstream model assessment. We release both the framework and the improved benchmarks to facilitate robust and reproducible multilingual AI development.",

    "abstract": "Sumerian transliteration is a conventional system for representing a scholar's interpretation of a tablet in the Latin script. Thanks to visionary digital Assyriology projects such as ETCSL, CDLI, and Oracc, a large number of Sumerian transliterations have been published online, and these data are well-structured for a variety of search and analysis tasks. However, the absence of a comprehensive, accessible dataset pairing transliterations with a digital representation of the tablet's cuneiform glyphs has prevented the application of modern Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods to the task of Sumerian transliteration.   To address this gap, we present SumTablets, a dataset pairing Unicode representations of 91,606 Sumerian cuneiform tablets (totaling 6,970,407 glyphs) with the associated transliterations published by Oracc. We construct SumTablets by first preprocessing and standardizing the Oracc transliterations before mapping each reading back to the Unicode representation of the source glyph. Further, we retain parallel structural information (e.g., surfaces, newlines, broken segments) through the use of special tokens. We release SumTablets as a Hugging Face Dataset (CC BY 4.0) and open source data preparation code via GitHub.   Additionally, we leverage SumTablets to implement and evaluate two transliteration baselines: (1) weighted sampling from a glyph's possible readings, and (2) fine-tuning an autoregressive language model. Our fine-tuned language model achieves an average transliteration character-level F-score (chrF) of 97.55, demonstrating the immediate potential of transformer-based transliteration models in allowing experts to rapidly verify generated transliterations rather than manually transliterating tablets one-by-one.",

    "abstract": "Frontier AI agents may pursue hidden goals while concealing their pursuit from oversight. Alignment training aims to prevent such behavior by reinforcing the correct goals, but alignment may not always succeed and can lead to unwanted side effects. We propose self-incrimination training, which instead trains agents to produce a visible signal when they covertly misbehave. We train GPT-4.1 and Gemini-2.0 agents to call a report_scheming() tool when behaving deceptively and measure their ability to cause harm undetected in out-of-distribution environments. Self-incrimination significantly reduces the undetected successful attack rate, outperforming matched-capability monitors and alignment baselines while preserving instruction hierarchy and incurring minimal safety tax on general capabilities. Unlike blackbox monitoring, self-incrimination performance is consistent across tasks regardless of how suspicious the misbehavior appears externally. The trained behavior persists under adversarial prompt optimization and generalizes to settings where agents pursue misaligned goals themselves rather than being instructed to misbehave. Our results suggest self-incrimination offers a viable path for reducing frontier misalignment risk, one that neither assumes misbehavior can be prevented nor that it can be reliably classified from the outside.",

    "abstract": "Advances in Generative AI (GenAI) have led to the development of various protection strategies to prevent the unauthorized use of images. These methods rely on adding imperceptible protective perturbations to images to thwart misuse such as style mimicry or deepfake manipulations. Although previous attacks on these protections required specialized, purpose-built methods, we demonstrate that this is no longer necessary. We show that off-the-shelf image-to-image GenAI models can be repurposed as generic ``denoisers\" using a simple text prompt, effectively removing a wide range of protective perturbations. Across 8 case studies spanning 6 diverse protection schemes, our general-purpose attack not only circumvents these defenses but also outperforms existing specialized attacks while preserving the image's utility for the adversary. Our findings reveal a critical and widespread vulnerability in the current landscape of image protection, indicating that many schemes provide a false sense of security. We stress the urgent need to develop robust defenses and establish that any future protection mechanism must be benchmarked against attacks from off-the-shelf GenAI models.

    "abstract": "AI systems depend on the invisible and undervalued labor of data workers, who are often treated as interchangeable units rather than collaborators with meaningful expertise. Critical scholars and practitioners have proposed alternative principles for data work, but few empirical studies examine how to enact them in practice. This paper bridges this gap through a case study of multilingual, iterative, and participatory data annotation processes with journalists and activists focused on news narratives of gender-related violence. We offer two methodological contributions. First, we demonstrate how workshops rooted in feminist epistemology can foster dialogue, build community, and disrupt knowledge hierarchies in data annotation. Second, drawing insights from practice, we deepen the analysis of existing feminist and participatory principles. We show that prioritizing context and pluralism in practice may require ``bounding'' context and working towards what we describe as a ``tactical consensus.'' We also explore tensions around materially acknowledging labor while resisting transactional researcher-participant dynamics. Through this work, we contribute to growing efforts to reimagine data and AI development as relational and political spaces for understanding difference, enacting care, and building solidarity across shared struggles.",

It is achieved by introducing a scarce resource (such as computational power, monetary stake, disk space, etc.), which prevents participants from costlessly creating multiple fake identities and hijacking the protocol. Quantum states are generically uncloneable, which suggests that they may serve naturally as an unconditionally scarce resource. In particular, uncloneability underlies quantum position-based cryptography, which is unachievable classically. We design a consensus protocol that combines classical hybrid consensus protocols with quantum position verification as the Sybil resistance mechanism, providing security in the standard model, and achieving improved energy efficiency compared to hybrid protocols based on Proof-of-Work. Our protocol inherits the benefits of other hybrid protocols, namely the faster confirmation times compared to pure Proof-of-Work protocols, and resilience against the compounding wealth issue that plagues protocols based on Proof-of-Stake Sybil resistance.

For example, recalling that Canberra is Australia's capital may benefit from thinking through major cities and the concept of purpose-built capitals. While reasoning language models are trained via reinforcement learning to produce reasoning traces on tasks such as mathematics, they may not reason well for accessing their own world knowledge. We first find that models do not generate their best world knowledge reasoning by default: adding a simple \"think step-by-step\" cue demonstrates statistically significant improvement in knowledge recall but not math. Motivated by this, we propose training models to reason over their parametric knowledge using world-knowledge question answering as a verifiable reward. After reinforcement learning on TriviaQA (+9.9%), performance also improves on Natural Questions, HotpotQA, SimpleQA, and StrategyQA by 4.2%, 2.1%, 0.6%, and 3.0%, respectively.

    "abstract": "Traditional software relies on contracts -- APIs, type systems, assertions -- to specify and enforce correct behavior. AI agents, by contrast, operate on prompts and natural language instructions with no formal behavioral specification. This gap is the root cause of drift, governance failures, and frequent project failures in agentic AI deployments. We introduce Agent Behavioral Contracts (ABC), a formal framework that brings Design-by-Contract principles to autonomous AI agents. An ABC contract C = (P, I, G, R) specifies Preconditions, Invariants, Governance policies, and Recovery mechanisms as first-class, runtime-enforceable components. We define (p, delta, k)-satisfaction -- a probabilistic notion of contract compliance that accounts for LLM non-determinism and recovery -- and prove a Drift Bounds Theorem showing that contracts with recovery rate gamma > alpha (the natural drift rate) bound behavioral drift to D* = alpha/gamma in expectation, with Gaussian concentration in the stochastic setting. We establish sufficient conditions for safe contract composition in multi-agent chains and derive probabilistic degradation bounds. We implement ABC in AgentAssert, a runtime enforcement library, and evaluate on AgentContract-Bench, a benchmark of 200 scenarios across 7 models from 6 vendors. Results across 1,980 sessions show that contracted agents detect 5.2-6.8 soft violations per session that uncontracted baselines miss entirely (p < 0.0001, Cohen's d = 6.7-33.8), achieve 88-100% hard constraint compliance, and bound behavioral drift to D* < 0.27 across extended sessions, with 100% recovery for frontier models and 17-100% across all models, at overhead < 10 ms per action.",

    "abstract": "Open-source native GUI agents still lag behind closed-source systems on long-horizon navigation tasks. This gap stems from two limitations: a shortage of high-quality, action-aligned reasoning data, and the direct adoption of generic post-training pipelines that overlook the unique challenges of GUI agents. We identify two fundamental issues in these pipelines: (i) standard SFT with CoT reasoning often hurts grounding, and (ii) step-wise RLVR-tyle training faces partial verifiability, where multiple actions can be correct but only a single demonstrated action is used for verification. This makes offline step-wise metrics weak predictors of online task success. In this work, we present GUI-Libra, a tailored training recipe that addresses these challenges. First, to mitigate the scarcity of action-aligned reasoning data, we introduce a data construction and filtering pipeline and release a curated 81K GUI reasoning dataset. Second, to reconcile reasoning with grounding, we propose action-aware SFT that mixes reasoning-then-action and direct-action data and reweights tokens to emphasize action and grounding. Third, to stabilize RL under partial verifiability, we identify the overlooked importance of KL regularization in RLVR and show that a KL trust region is critical for improving offline-to-online predictability; we further introduce success-adaptive scaling to downweight unreliable negative gradients. Across diverse web and mobile benchmarks, GUI-Libra consistently improves both step-wise accuracy and end-to-end task completion. Our results suggest that carefully designed post-training and data curation can unlock significantly stronger task-solving capabilities without costly online data collection. We release our dataset, code, and models to facilitate further research on data-efficient post-training for reasoning-capable GUI agents.",

    "abstract": "Modelling rock-fluid interaction requires solving a set of partial differential equations (PDEs) to predict the flow behaviour and the reactions of the fluid with the rock on the interfaces. Conventional high-fidelity numerical models require a high resolution to obtain reliable results, resulting in huge computational expense. This restricts the applicability of these models for multi-query problems, such as uncertainty quantification and optimisation, which require running numerous scenarios. As a cheaper alternative to high-fidelity models, this work develops eight surrogate models for predicting the fluid flow in porous media. Four of these are reduced-order models (ROM) based on one neural network for compression and another for prediction. The other four are single neural networks with the property of grid-size invariance; a term which we use to refer to image-to-image models that are capable of inferring on computational domains that are larger than those used during training. In addition to the novel grid-size-invariant framework for surrogate models, we compare the predictive performance of UNet and UNet++ architectures, and demonstrate that UNet++ outperforms UNet for surrogate models. Furthermore, we show that the grid-size-invariant approach is a reliable way to reduce memory consumption during training, resulting in good correlation between predicted and ground-truth values and outperforming the ROMs analysed. The application analysed is particularly challenging because fluid-induced rock dissolution results in a non-static solid field and, consequently, it cannot be used to help in adjustments of the future prediction.",

We target the Non-eXportable Key (NXK) setting enforced by hardware-backed key-isolation modules (e.g., TEEs, HSM-like APIs), formalized via an ideal KeyBox (keystore) functionality $\\mathcal{F}_{KeyBox}$ that keeps shares non-exportable and permits only attested KeyBox-to-KeyBox sealing.

State continuity rules out rewinding-based extraction, mandating straight-line techniques.   We combine (i) KeyBox confidentiality; (ii) Unique Structure Verification (USV), a publicly verifiable certificate whose certified scalar never leaves the KeyBox yet whose public group element is transcript-derivable; and (iii) Fischlin-based UC-extractable NIZK arguments of knowledge in a gRO-CRP (global Random Oracle with Context-Restricted Programmability) model. We construct Star DKG (SDKG), a UC-secure scheme for multi-device threshold wallets where a designated service must co-sign but cannot sign alone, realizing a 1+1-out-of-$n$ star access structure (center plus any leaf) over roles (primary vs. recovery) with role-based device registration. In the $\\mathcal{F}_{KeyBox}$-hybrid and gRO-CRP models, under DL and DDH assumptions with adaptive corruptions and secure erasures, SDKG UC-realizes a transcript-driven refinement of the standard UC-DKG functionality. Over a prime-order group of size $p$, SDKG incurs $\\widetilde{O}(n\\log p)$ communication overhead and $\\widetilde{O}(n\\log^{2.585}p)$ bit-operation cost.",

    "abstract": "Assessments are critical in education, but creating them can be difficult. To address this challenge in a grounded way, we partnered with 13 teachers in a seven-month codesign process. We developed a conceptual model that characterizes the iterative dual process where teachers develop assessments while simultaneously refining requirements. To enact this model in practice, we built Ripplet, a web-based tool with multilevel reusable interactions to support assessment authoring. The extended codesign revealed that Ripplet enabled teachers to create formative assessments they would not have otherwise made, shifted their practices from generation to curation, and helped them reflect more on assessment quality. In a user study with 15 additional teachers, compared to their current practices, teachers felt the results were more worth their effort and that assessment quality improved.",

In the testable learning setting, the aim is the design of a tester-learner pair satisfying the following properties: (1) if the tester accepts, the learner outputs a hypothesis and a certificate that it achieves near-optimal error, and (2) it is highly unlikely that the tester rejects if the data satisfies the underlying assumptions. Our main result is the first testable learning algorithm for general halfspaces with Massart noise and Gaussian marginals. The complexity of our algorithm is $d^{\\mathrm{polylog}(\\min\\{1/γ, 1/ε\\})}$, where $ε$ is the excess error and $γ$ is the bias of the target halfspace, which qualitatively matches the known quasi-polynomial Statistical Query lower bound for the non-testable setting.

Recent QA systems that are designed to handle complex questions work either on the basis of knowledge graphs, or utilise contem- porary neural models that are expensive to train, in terms of both computational resources and the volume of training data required. In this paper, we present LiCQA, an unsupervised question answer- ing model that works primarily on the basis of corpus evidence.

In medicine, for example, it allows determining which patients benefit from treatment, and in predictive maintenance, which components are more likely to fail. Existing methods for discovering subgroups with exceptional survival characteristics require restrictive assumptions about the survival model (e.g. proportional hazards), pre-discretized features, and, as they compare average statistics, tend to overlook individual deviations. In this paper, we propose Sysurv, a fully differentiable, non-parametric method that leverages random survival forests to learn individual survival curves, automatically learns conditions and how to combine these into inherently interpretable rules, so as to select subgroups with exceptional survival characteristics. Empirical evaluation on a wide range of datasets and settings, including a case study on cancer data, shows that Sysurv reveals insightful and actionable survival subgroups.",

    "abstract": "Video-based ads are a vital medium for brands to engage consumers, with social media platforms leveraging user data to optimize ad delivery and boost engagement. A crucial but under-explored aspect is the 'hooking period', the first three seconds that capture viewer attention and influence engagement metrics. Analyzing this brief window is challenging due to the multimodal nature of video content, which blends visual, auditory, and textual elements. Traditional methods often miss the nuanced interplay of these components, requiring advanced frameworks for thorough evaluation.   This study presents a framework using transformer-based multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to analyze the hooking period of video ads. It tests two frame sampling strategies, uniform random sampling and key frame selection, to ensure balanced and representative acoustic feature extraction, capturing the full range of design elements. The hooking video is processed by state-of-the-art MLLMs to generate descriptive analyses of the ad's initial impact, which are distilled into coherent topics using BERTopic for high-level abstraction. The framework also integrates features such as audio attributes and aggregated ad targeting information, enriching the feature set for further analysis.   Empirical validation on large-scale real-world data from social media platforms demonstrates the efficacy of our framework, revealing correlations between hooking period features and key performance metrics like conversion per investment. The results highlight the practical applicability and predictive power of the approach, offering valuable insights for optimizing video ad strategies. This study advances video ad analysis by providing a scalable methodology for understanding and enhancing the initial moments of video advertisements.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, a standard computational pathology workflow has emerged where whole slide images are cropped into tiles, these tiles are processed using a foundation model, and task-specific models are built using the resulting representations. At least 15 different foundation models have been proposed, and the vast majority are trained exclusively with tiles using the 20$\\times$ magnification. However, it is well known that certain histologic features can only be discerned with larger context windows and requires a pathologist to zoom in and out when analyzing a whole slide image. Furthermore, creating 224$\\times$224 pixel crops at 20$\\times$ leads to a large number of tiles per slide, which can be gigapixel in size. To more accurately capture multi-resolution features and investigate the possibility of reducing the number of representations per slide, we propose a region-level mixing encoder. Our approach jointly fuses image tile representations of a mixed magnification foundation model using a masked embedding modeling pretraining step. We explore a design space for pretraining the proposed mixed-magnification region aggregators and evaluate our models on transfer to biomarker prediction tasks representing various cancer types. Results demonstrate cancer dependent improvements in predictive performance, highlighting the importance of spatial context and understanding.",

    "abstract": "Understanding and reasoning over long contexts is a crucial capability for language models (LMs). Although recent models support increasingly long context windows, their accuracy often deteriorates as input length grows. In practice, models often struggle to keep attention aligned with the most relevant context throughout decoding. In this work, we propose DySCO, a novel decoding algorithm for improving long-context reasoning. DySCO leverages retrieval heads--a subset of attention heads specialized for long-context retrieval--to identify task-relevant tokens at each decoding step and explicitly up-weight them. By doing so, DySCO dynamically adjusts attention during generation to better utilize relevant context. The method is training-free and can be applied directly to any off-the-shelf LMs. Across multiple instruction-tuned and reasoning models, DySCO consistently improves performance on challenging long-context reasoning benchmarks, yielding relative gains of up to 25% on MRCR and LongBenchV2 at 128K context length with modest additional compute. Further analysis highlights the importance of both dynamic attention rescaling and retrieval-head-guided selection for the effectiveness of the method, while providing interpretability insights into decoding-time attention behavior.

    "abstract": "Mixed-Integer Programs (MIPs) are NP-hard optimization models that arise in a broad range of decision-making applications, including finance, logistics, energy systems, and network design. Although modern commercial solvers have achieved remarkable progress and perform effectively on many small- and medium-sized instances, their performance often degrades when confronted with large-cale or highly constrained formulations. This paper explores the use of the Random-Key Optimizer (RKO) framework as a flexible, metaheuristic alternative for computing high-quality solutions to MIPs through the design of problem-specific decoders. The proposed approach separates the search process from feasibility enforcement by operating in a continuous random-key space while mapping candidate solutions to feasible integer solutions via efficient decoding procedures. We evaluate the methodology on two representative and structurally distinct benchmark problems: the mean-variance Markowitz portfolio optimization problem with buy-in and cardinality constraints, and the Time-Dependent Traveling Salesman Problem. For each formulation, tailored decoders are developed to reduce the effective search space, promote feasibility, and accelerate convergence. Computational experiments demonstrate that RKO consistently produces competitive, and in several cases superior, solutions compared to a state-of-the-art commercial MIP solver, both in terms of solution quality and computational time. These results highlight the potential of RKO as a scalable and versatile heuristic framework for tackling challenging large-scale MIPs.",

In a user study with 12 participants, we analysed sketch-based design interactions with an MLLM-powered system using automatically recorded interaction logs and post-task interviews. Based on how creative responsibility was allocated between humans and the AI, we predefined four interaction modes: Human-Only, Human-Lead, AI-Lead, and Co-Evolution, and analysed how these modes manifested during sketch-based design ideation. Our results show that designers rarely rely on a single mode; instead, human-led and AI-led roles are frequently interwoven and shift across ideation instances. These findings provide an empirical basis for future work to investigate why designers shift roles with AI and how interactive systems can better support such dynamic collaboration.",

We revisit this challenge from a cross-scale distribution transition perspective and propose CASR, a simple yet highly efficient cyclic SR framework that reformulates ultra-magnification as a sequence of in-distribution scale transitions. This design ensures stable inference at arbitrary scales while requiring only a single model. CASR tackles two major bottlenecks: distribution drift across iterations and patch-wise diffusion inconsistencies. The proposed SDAM module aligns structural distributions via superpixel aggregation, preventing error accumulation, while SARM module restores high-frequency textures by enforcing autocorrelation and embedding LR self-similarity priors. Despite using only a single model, our approach significantly reduces distribution drift, preserves long-range texture consistency, and achieves superior generalization even at extreme magnification.",

    "abstract": "Checkpointing is essential for fault tolerance in training large language models (LLMs). However, existing methods, regardless of their I/O strategies, periodically store the entire model and optimizer states, incurring substantial storage overhead and resource contention. Recent studies reveal that updates across LLM layers are highly non-uniform. Across training steps, some layers may undergo more significant changes, while others remain relatively stable or even unchanged. This suggests that selectively checkpointing only layers with significant updates could reduce overhead without harming training. Implementing such selective strategies requires fine-grained control over both weights and optimizer states, which no current tool provides. To address this gap, we propose \\texttt{LLMTailor}, a checkpoint-merging framework that filters and assembles layers from different checkpoints to form a composite checkpoint. Our evaluation indicates that LLMTailor can work with different selective checkpointing strategies and effectively reduce checkpoint size (e.g., 4.3 times smaller for Llama3.1-8B) and checkpoint time (e.g., 2.8 times faster for Qwen2.5-7B) while maintaining model quality.",

We propose a model-agnostic framework for dynamic personality simulation that employs state machines to represent latent personality states, where transition probabilities are dynamically adapted to the conversational context. Part of our architecture is a modular pipeline for continuous personality scoring that evaluates dialogues along latent axes while remaining agnostic to the specific personality models, their dimensions, transition mechanisms, or LLMs used. These scores function as dynamic state variables that systematically reconfigure the system prompt, steering behavioral alignment throughout the interaction.We evaluate this framework by operationalizing the Interpersonal Circumplex (IPC) in a medical education setting. Results demonstrate that the system successfully adapts its personality state to user inputs, but also influences user behavior, thereby facilitating de-escalation training. Notably, the scoring pipeline maintains comparable precision even when utilizing lightweight, fine-tuned classifiers instead of large-scale LLMs. This work demonstrates the feasibility of modular, personality-adaptive architectures for education, customer support, and broader human-computer interaction.",

This paper presents a position-based flocking model that achieves persistent velocity alignment without velocity sensing. By approximating relative velocity differences from changes between current and initial relative positions and incorporating a time- and density-dependent alignment gain with a non-zero minimum threshold to maintain persistent alignment, the model sustains coherent collective motion over extended periods. Simulations with a collective of 50 agents demonstrate that the position-based flocking model attains faster and more sustained directional alignment and results in more compact formations than a velocity-alignment-based baseline. This position-based flocking model is particularly well-suited for real-world robotic swarms, where velocity measurements are unreliable, noisy, or unavailable. Experimental results using a team of nine real wheeled mobile robots are also presented.",

    "abstract": "Most contemporary neural learning systems rely on epoch-based optimization and repeated access to historical data, implicitly assuming reversible computation. In contrast, real-world environments often present information as irreversible streams, where inputs cannot be replayed or revisited. Under such conditions, conventional architectures degrade into reactive filters lacking long-horizon coherence. This paper introduces Stream Neural Networks (StNN), an execution paradigm designed for irreversible input streams. StNN operates through a stream-native execution algorithm, the Stream Network Algorithm (SNA), whose fundamental unit is the stream neuron. Each stream neuron maintains a persistent temporal state that evolves continuously across inputs. We formally establish three structural guarantees: (1) stateless mappings collapse under irreversibility and cannot encode temporal dependencies; (2) persistent state dynamics remain bounded under mild activation constraints; and (3) the state transition operator is contractive for λ < 1, ensuring stable long-horizon execution. Empirical phase-space analysis and continuous tracking experiments validate these theoretical results. The execution principles introduced in this work define a minimal substrate for neural computation under irreversible streaming constraints.",

CoLoGen uses a staged curriculum that first builds core conceptual and localization abilities, then adapts them to diverse visual conditions, and finally refines their synergy for complex instruction-driven tasks. Central to this process is the Progressive Representation Weaving (PRW) module, which dynamically routes features to specialized experts and stably integrates their outputs across stages. Experiments on editing, controllable generation, and customized generation show that CoLoGen achieves competitive or superior performance, offering a principled representational perspective for unified image generation.",

    "title": "Enhancing Framingham Cardiovascular Risk Score Transparency through Logic-Based XAI",
    "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains one of the leading global health challenges, accounting for more than 19 million deaths worldwide. To address this, several tools that aim to predict CVD risk and support clinical decision making have been developed. In particular, the Framingham Risk Score (FRS) is one of the most widely used and recommended worldwide. However, it does not explain why a patient was assigned to a particular risk category nor how it can be reduced. Due to this lack of transparency, we present a logical explainer for the FRS. Based on first-order logic and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) fundaments, the explainer is capable of identifying a minimal set of patient attributes that are sufficient to explain a given risk classification. Our explainer also produces actionable scenarios that illustrate which modifiable variables would reduce a patient's risk category. We evaluated all possible input combinations of the FRS (over 22,000 samples) and tested them with our explainer, successfully identifying important risk factors and suggesting focused interventions for each case. The results may improve clinician trust and facilitate a wider implementation of CVD risk assessment by converting opaque scores into transparent and prescriptive insights, particularly in areas with restricted access to specialists.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) plays a significant role in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences. While RLHF with expected reward constraints can be formulated as a primal-dual optimization problem, standard primal-dual methods only guarantee convergence with a distributional policy where the saddle-point problem is in convex-concave form. Moreover, standard primal-dual methods may exhibit instability or divergence in the last iterate under policy parameterization in practical applications. In this work, we propose a universal primal-dual framework for safe RLHF that unifies a broad class of existing alignment algorithms, including safe-RLHF, one-shot, and multi-shot based methods. Building on this framework, we introduce an optimistic primal-dual (OPD) algorithm that incorporates predictive updates for both primal and dual variables to stabilize saddle-point dynamics. We establish last-iterate convergence guarantees for the proposed method, covering both exact policy optimization in the distributional space and convergence to a neighborhood of the optimal solution whose gap is related to approximation error and bias under parameterized policies. Our analysis reveals that optimism plays a crucial role in mitigating oscillations inherent to constrained alignment objectives, thereby closing a key theoretical gap between constrained RL and practical RLHF.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to ``professionalize'' workplace communication, often at the cost of linguistic identity. We introduce \"Cultural Ghosting\", the systematic erasure of linguistic markers unique to non-native English varieties during text processing. Through analysis of 22,350 LLM outputs generated from 1,490 culturally marked texts (Indian, Singaporean,& Nigerian English) processed by five models under three prompt conditions, we quantify this phenomenon using two novel metrics: Identity Erasure Rate (IER) & Semantic Preservation Score (SPS). Across all prompts, we find an overall IER of 10.26%, with model-level variation from 3.5% to 20.5% (5.9x range). Crucially, we identify a Semantic Preservation Paradox: models maintain high semantic similarity (mean SPS = 0.748) while systematically erasing cultural markers. Pragmatic markers (politeness conventions) are 1.9x more vulnerable than lexical markers (71.5% vs. 37.1% erasure). Our experiments demonstrate that explicit cultural-preservation prompts reduce erasure by 29% without sacrificing semantic quality.",

We introduce AviaSafe, a hierarchical, physics-informed neural forecaster that produces global, six-hourly predictions of these four hydrometeor species for lead times up to 7 days. Our approach addresses the unique challenges of cloud prediction: extreme sparsity, discontinuous distributions, and complex microphysical interactions between species. We integrate the Icing Condition (IC) index from aviation meteorology as a physics-based constraint that identifies regions where supercooled water fuels explosive ice crystal growth. The model employs a hierarchical architecture that first predicts cloud spatial distribution through masked attention, then quantifies species concentrations within identified regions. Training on ERA5 reanalysis data, our model achieves lower RMSE for cloud species compared to baseline and outperforms operational numerical models on certain key variables at 7-day lead times. The ability to forecast individual cloud species enables new applications in aviation route optimization where distinguishing between ice and liquid water determines engine icing risk.",

    "abstract": "Object hallucination is a critical issue in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), where outputs include objects that do not appear in the input image. A natural question arises from this phenomenon: Which component of the LVLM pipeline primarily contributes to object hallucinations? The vision encoder to perceive visual information, or the language decoder to generate text responses? In this work, we strive to answer this question through designing a systematic experiment to analyze the roles of the vision encoder and the language decoder in hallucination generation. Our observations reveal that object hallucinations are predominantly associated with the strong priors from the language decoder. Based on this finding, we propose a simple and training-free framework, No-Language-Hallucination Decoding, NoLan, which refines the output distribution by dynamically suppressing language priors, modulated based on the output distribution difference between multimodal and text-only inputs. Experimental results demonstrate that NoLan effectively reduces object hallucinations across various LVLMs on different tasks. For instance, NoLan achieves substantial improvements on POPE, enhancing the accuracy of LLaVA-1.5 7B and Qwen-VL 7B by up to 6.45 and 7.21, respectively.

    "abstract": "Medical vision-language pretraining increasingly relies on medical reports as large-scale supervisory signals; however, raw reports often exhibit substantial stylistic heterogeneity, variable length, and a considerable amount of image-irrelevant content. Although text normalization is frequently adopted as a preprocessing step in prior work, its design principles and empirical impact on vision-language pretraining remain insufficiently and systematically examined. In this study, we present MedTri, a deployable normalization framework for medical vision-language pretraining that converts free-text reports into a unified [Anatomical Entity: Radiologic Description + Diagnosis Category] triplet. This structured, anatomy-grounded normalization preserves essential morphological and spatial information while removing stylistic noise and image-irrelevant content, providing consistent and image-grounded textual supervision at scale. Across multiple datasets spanning both X-ray and computed tomography (CT) modalities, we demonstrate that structured, anatomy-grounded text normalization is an important factor in medical vision-language pretraining quality, yielding consistent improvements over raw reports and existing normalization baselines. In addition, we illustrate how this normalization can easily support modular text-level augmentation strategies, including knowledge enrichment and anatomy-grounded counterfactual supervision, which provide complementary gains in robustness and generalization without altering the core normalization process. Together, our results position structured text normalization as a critical and generalizable preprocessing component for medical vision-language learning, while MedTri provides this normalization platform.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models have greatly improved visual understanding and reasoning, yet their quadratic attention and offline training protocols make them ill-suited for streaming settings where frames arrive sequentially and future observations are inaccessible. We diagnose a core limitation of current Video-LLMs, namely Time-Agnosticism, in which videos are treated as an unordered bag of evidence rather than a causally ordered sequence, yielding two failures in streams: temporal order ambiguity, in which the model cannot follow or reason over the correct chronological order, and past-current focus blindness where it fails to distinguish present observations from accumulated history. We present WeaveTime, a simple, efficient, and model agnostic framework that first teaches order and then uses order. We introduce a lightweight Temporal Reconstruction objective-our Streaming Order Perception enhancement-that instills order aware representations with minimal finetuning and no specialized streaming data. At inference, a Past-Current Dynamic Focus Cache performs uncertainty triggered, coarse-to-fine retrieval, expanding history only when needed. Plugged into exsiting Video-LLM without architectural changes, WeaveTime delivers consistent gains on representative streaming benchmarks, improving accuracy while reducing latency. These results establish WeaveTime as a practical path toward time aware stream Video-LLMs under strict online, time causal constraints. Code and weights will be made publicly available.

Our approach combines a narrowband LED array with a coded-exposure-pixel (CEP) camera capable of high-speed, per-pixel exposure control, enabling joint encoding of scene information across space, time, and wavelength within each video frame. Unlike passive snapshot systems that divide light across multiple spectral channels simultaneously and assume no motion during a frame's exposure, Lumosaic actively synchronizes illumination and pixel-wise exposure, improving photon utilization and preserving spectral fidelity under motion. A learning-based reconstruction pipeline then recovers 31-channel hyperspectral (400-700 nm) video at 30 fps and VGA resolution, producing temporally coherent and spectrally accurate reconstructions. Experiments on synthetic and real data demonstrate that Lumosaic significantly improves reconstruction fidelity and temporal stability over existing snapshot hyperspectral imaging systems, enabling robust hyperspectral video across diverse materials and motion conditions.",

While uniform quantization provides a straightforward approach to compress model and reduce hardware requirement, it fails to fully leverage the varying robustness across layers, and often lead to accuracy degradation or suboptimal resource usage, particularly at low bitwidths. In contrast, heterogeneous quantization, which allocates different bitwidths to individual layers, can mitigate these drawbacks. Nonetheless, current heterogeneous quantization methods either needs huge brute-force design space search or lacks the adaptability to meet different hardware conditions, such as memory size, energy budget, and latency requirement. Filling these gaps, this work introduces \\textbf{\\textit{SigmaQuant}}, an adaptive layer-wise heterogeneous quantization framework designed to efficiently balance accuracy and resource usage for varied edge environments without exhaustive search.",

    "abstract": "In type theory, an oracle may be specified abstractly by a predicate whose domain is the type of queries asked of the oracle, and whose proofs are the oracle answers. Such a specification induces an oracle modality that captures a computational intuition about oracles: at each step of reasoning we either know the result, or we ask the oracle a query and proceed upon receiving an answer. We characterize an oracle modality as the least one forcing the given predicate. We establish an adjoint retraction between modalities and propositional containers, from which it follows that every modality is an oracle modality. The left adjoint maps sums to suprema, which makes suprema of modalities easy to compute when they are given in terms of oracle modalities. We also study sheaves for oracle modalities. We describe sheafification in terms of a quotient-inductive type of computation trees, and describe sheaves as algebras for the corresponding monad. We also introduce equifoliate trees, an intensional notion of oracle computation given by a (non-propositional) container. Equifoliate trees descend to sheaves, and lift from sheaves in case the container is projective. As an application, we give a concrete description of all Lawvere-Tierney topologies in a realizability topos, closely related to a game-theoretic characterization by Takayuki Kihara.",

However, this AI-native architecture also introduces new vulnerabilities, as semantic failures may arise from adversarial perturbations to models, corrupted training data, desynchronized priors, or misaligned inference even when lower-layer transmission reliability and cryptographic protection remain intact. This survey provides a defense-centered and system-oriented synthesis of security in SemCom via AI defense. We analyze AI-centric threat models by consolidating existing studies and organizing attack surfaces across model-level, channel-realizable, knowledge-based, and networked inference vectors. Building on this foundation, we present a structured taxonomy of defense strategies organized by where semantic integrity can be compromised in SemCom systems despite correct symbol delivery, spanning semantic encoding, wireless transmission, knowledge integrity, and coordination among multiple agents. These categories correspond to distinct security failure modes, including representation fragility, channel-realizable manipulation, semantic prior poisoning or desynchronization, and adversarial propagation through distributed inference. We also examine security utility operating envelopes that capture tradeoffs among semantic fidelity, robustness, latency, and energy under realistic constraints, survey evaluation frameworks and representative applications, and identify open challenges in cross-layer composition and deployment-time certification. Overall, this survey offers a unified system-level perspective that enables readers to understand major threat and defense mechanisms in AI-native SemCom systems and to leverage emerging security techniques in the design and deployment of robust SemCom architectures for next-generation intelligent networks.",

However, not all surprises are equally informative-some yield genuine insight while others remain aesthetic shock. Drawing on epiplexity-structured, learnable information extractable by bounded observers-we propose decomposing the knowledge generated by speculative artifacts into structured epistemic information (transferable implications about futures) and entropic noise (narrative, aesthetics, and surface-level surprise). We conclude by introducing a practical audit framework with a self-assessment questionnaire that enables designers to evaluate whether their speculations yield rich, high-epiplexity insights or remain at a superficial level.

    "abstract": "We study the basic task of mean estimation in the presence of mean-shift contamination. In the mean-shift contamination model, an adversary is allowed to replace a small constant fraction of the clean samples by samples drawn from arbitrarily shifted versions of the base distribution. Prior work characterized the sample complexity of this task for the special cases of the Gaussian and Laplace distributions. Specifically, it was shown that consistent estimation is possible in these cases, a property that is provably impossible in Huber's contamination model. An open question posed in earlier work was to determine the sample complexity of mean estimation in the mean-shift contamination model for general base distributions. In this work, we study and essentially resolve this open question. Specifically, we show that, under mild spectral conditions on the characteristic function of the (potentially multivariate) base distribution, there exists a sample-efficient algorithm that estimates the target mean to any desired accuracy. We complement our upper bound with a qualitatively matching sample complexity lower bound. Our techniques make critical use of Fourier analysis, and in particular introduce the notion of a Fourier witness as an essential ingredient of our upper and lower bounds.",

    "abstract": "Small language models (SLMs) offer compelling advantages in cost, latency, and adaptability, but have so far lagged behind larger models on long-horizon software engineering tasks such as SWE-bench, where they suffer from pervasive action looping and low resolution rates. We introduce SWE-Protégé, a post-training framework that reframes software repair as an expert-protégé collaboration problem. In SWE-Protégé, an SLM remains the sole decision-maker while learning to selectively seek guidance from a strong expert model, recognize stalled states, and follow through on expert feedback. Our approach combines supervised fine-tuning on expert-augmented trajectories with agentic reinforcement learning that explicitly discourages degenerative looping and unproductive expert collaboration. We lightly post-train Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct to achieve 42.4% Pass@1 on SWE-bench Verified, a +25.4% improvement over the prior SLM state of the art, while using expert assistance sparsely (~4 calls per task and 11% of total tokens).",

    "title": "Probing the Geometry of Diffusion Models with the String Method",
    "abstract": "Understanding the geometry of learned distributions is fundamental to improving and interpreting diffusion models, yet systematic tools for exploring their landscape remain limited. Standard latent-space interpolations fail to respect the structure of the learned distribution, often traversing low-density regions. We introduce a framework based on the string method that computes continuous paths between samples by evolving curves under the learned score function. Operating on pretrained models without retraining, our approach interpolates between three regimes: pure generative transport, which yields continuous sample paths; gradient-dominated dynamics, which recover minimum energy paths (MEPs); and finite-temperature string dynamics, which compute principal curves -- self-consistent paths that balance energy and entropy. We demonstrate that the choice of regime matters in practice. For image diffusion models, MEPs contain high-likelihood but unrealistic ''cartoon'' images, confirming prior observations that likelihood maxima appear unrealistic; principal curves instead yield realistic morphing sequences despite lower likelihood. For protein structure prediction, our method computes transition pathways between metastable conformers directly from models trained on static structures, yielding paths with physically plausible intermediates. Together, these results establish the string method as a principled tool for probing the modal structure of diffusion models -- identifying modes, characterizing barriers, and mapping connectivity in complex learned distributions.",

    "abstract": "Text-to-image (T2I) models are rapidly gaining popularity, yet their outputs often lack geographical diversity, reinforce stereotypes, and misrepresent regions. Given their broad reach, it is critical to rigorously evaluate how these models portray the world. Existing diversity metrics either rely on curated datasets or focus on surface-level visual similarity, limiting interpretability. We introduce GeoDiv, a framework leveraging large language and vision-language models to assess geographical diversity along two complementary axes: the Socio-Economic Visual Index (SEVI), capturing economic and condition-related cues, and the Visual Diversity Index (VDI), measuring variation in primary entities and backgrounds. Applied to images generated by models such as Stable Diffusion and FLUX.1-dev across $10$ entities and $16$ countries, GeoDiv reveals a consistent lack of diversity and identifies fine-grained attributes where models default to biased portrayals. Strikingly, depictions of countries like India, Nigeria, and Colombia are disproportionately impoverished and worn, reflecting underlying socio-economic biases. These results highlight the need for greater geographical nuance in generative models. GeoDiv provides the first systematic, interpretable framework for measuring such biases, marking a step toward fairer and more inclusive generative systems.

This versatility allows them to achieve speed and energy-efficiency on smooth terrain and agility over rough terrain. Inspired by these athletes, we present the design and control of a robotic platform, Ultra Mobility Vehicle (UMV), which combines a bicycle and a reaction mass to move dynamically with minimal actuated degrees of freedom. We employ a simulation-driven design optimization process to synthesize a spatial linkage topology with a focus on vertical jump height and momentum-based balancing on a single wheel contact. Using a constrained Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework, we demonstrate zero-shot transfer of diverse athletic behaviors, including track-stands, jumps, wheelies, rear wheel hopping, and front flips. This 23.5 kg robot is capable of high speeds (8 m/s) and jumping on and over large obstacles (1 m tall, or 130% of the robot's nominal height).",

We show that solutions for this problem can be determined by solving polynomially many instances of the corresponding nominal problem. As a direct consequence, our result implies that this robust flowshop problem can be solved in polynomial time for two machines, and can be approximated in polynomial time for any fixed number of machines. The reduction that is our main result follows from an analysis similar to Bertsimas and Sim (2003) except that dualization is applied to the terms of a min-max objective rather than to a linear objective function. Our result may be surprising considering that heuristic and exact integer programming based methods have been developed in the literature for solving the two-machine flowshop problem. We conclude by showing a logarithmic factor improvement in the overall running time implied by a naive reduction to nominal problems in the case of two machines and three machines.",

    "abstract": "In the One-Fast-Many-Slow decision problem, introduced by Sheffield and Westover (ITCS '25), a scheduler, with access to one fast machine and infinitely many slow machines, receives a series of tasks and must allocate the work among its machines. The goal is to minimize the overhead of an online algorithm over the optimal offline algorithm. Three versions of this setting were considered: Instantly-committing schedulers that must assign tasks to machines immediately and irrevocably, Eventually-committing schedulers whose assignments are irrevocable but can occur anytime after a task arrives, and Never-committing schedulers that can interrupt and restart a task on a different machine. In the Instantly-committing model, Sheffield and Westover showed that the optimal competitive ratio is equal to 2, while in the Eventually-committing model the competitive ratio lies in the interval [1.618, 1.678], and in the Never-committing model the competitive ratio lies in the interval [1.366, 1.5] (SPAA '24, ITCS '25). In the latter two models, the exact optimal competitive ratios were left as open problems, moreover Kuszmaul and Westover (SPAA '24) conjectured that the lower bound in the Eventually-committing model is tight.   In this paper we resolve this problem by providing tight bounds for the competitive ratios in the Eventually-committing and Never-committing models. For Eventually-committing, we prove Kuszmaul and Westover's conjecture by giving an algorithm achieving a competitive ratio equal to the lower bound of $\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}\\approx 1.618$. For Never-committing, we provide an explicit Task Arrival Process (TAP) lower bounding the competitive ratio to the previous upper bound of 1.5.",

    "abstract": "Despite the extensive literature on training loss functions, the evaluation of generalization on the validation set remains underexplored. In this work, we conduct a systematic empirical and statistical study of how the validation criterion used for model selection affects test performance in neural classifiers, with attention to early stopping. Using fully connected networks on standard benchmarks under $k$-fold evaluation, we compare: (i) early stopping with patience and (ii) post-hoc selection over all epochs (i.e. no early stopping). Models are trained with cross-entropy, C-Loss, or PolyLoss; the model parameter selection on the validation set is made using accuracy or one of the three loss functions, each considered independently. Three main findings emerge. (1) Early stopping based on validation accuracy performs worst, consistently selecting checkpoints with lower test accuracy than both loss-based early stopping and post-hoc selection. (2) Loss-based validation criteria yield comparable and more stable test accuracy. (3) Across datasets and folds, any single validation rule often underperforms the test-optimal checkpoint. Overall, the selected model typically achieves test-set performance statistically lower than the best performance across all epochs, regardless of the validation criterion. Our results suggest avoiding validation accuracy (in particular with early stopping) for parameter selection, favoring loss-based validation criteria.",

    "abstract": "Many real-world applications provide a continuous stream of data that is subsequently used by machine learning models to solve regression tasks of interest. Hoeffding trees and their variants have a long-standing tradition due to their effectiveness, either alone or as base models in broader ensembles. At the same time a recent line of work in batch learning has shown that kernel density estimation (KDE) is an effective approach for smoothed predictions in imbalanced regression tasks [Yang et al., 2021]. Moreover, another recent line of work for batch learning, called hierarchical shrinkage (HS) [Agarwal et al., 2022], has introduced a post-hoc regularization method for decision trees that does not alter the structure of the learned tree. Using a telescoping argument we cast KDE to streaming environments and extend the implementation of HS to incremental decision tree models. Armed with these extensions we investigate the performance of decision trees that may enjoy such options in datasets commonly used for regression in online settings. We conclude that KDE is beneficial in the early parts of the stream, while HS hardly, if ever, offers performance benefits.

In addition, connectors must be inserted with limited force to avoid damage, while their poses can vary significantly. While humans can do this task intuitively by combining visual and haptic feedback, programming an industrial robot for such a task in an adaptable manner remains difficult. This work presents an empirical study investigating the suitability of behavioral cloning for learning an action prediction model for connector insertion that fuses force-torque sensing with a fixed position camera. We compare several network architectures and other design choices using a dataset of up to 300 successful human demonstrations collected via teleoperation of a UR5e robot with a SpaceMouse under varying connector poses. The resulting system is then evaluated against five different connector geometries under varying connector poses, achieving an overall insertion success rate of over 90 %.",

    "abstract": "Editable high-fidelity 4D scenes are crucial for autonomous driving, as they can be applied to end-to-end training and closed-loop simulation. However, existing reconstruction methods are primarily limited to replicating observed scenes and lack the capability for diverse weather simulation. While image-level weather editing methods tend to introduce scene artifacts and offer poor controllability over the weather effects. To address these limitations, we propose WeatherCity, a novel framework for 4D urban scene reconstruction and weather editing. Specifically, we leverage a text-guided image editing model to achieve flexible editing of image weather backgrounds. To tackle the challenge of multi-weather modeling, we introduce a novel weather Gaussian representation based on shared scene features and dedicated weather-specific decoders. This representation is further enhanced with a content consistency optimization, ensuring coherent modeling across different weather conditions. Additionally, we design a physics-driven model that simulates dynamic weather effects through particles and motion patterns. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and various scenes demonstrate that WeatherCity achieves flexible controllability, high fidelity, and temporal consistency in 4D reconstruction and weather editing. Our framework not only enables fine-grained control over weather conditions (e.g., light rain and heavy snow) but also supports object-level manipulation within the scene.",

We propose a Petri net reachability relaxation to enable robust invariant synthesis, efficient goal-unreachability detection, and helpful infeasibility explanations. We further leverage incremental constraint solvers to support goal and constraint updates. Empirically, compared to baselines, our system produces a comparable number of invariants, detects up to 2 times more infeasibilities, performs competitively in one-shot planning, and outperforms in sequential plan updates in the tested domains.",

    "title": "Learning to Drive is a Free Gift: Large-Scale Label-Free Autonomy Pretraining from Unposed In-The-Wild Videos",
    "abstract": "Ego-centric driving videos available online provide an abundant source of visual data for autonomous driving, yet their lack of annotations makes it difficult to learn representations that capture both semantic structure and 3D geometry. Recent advances in large feedforward spatial models demonstrate that point maps and ego-motion can be inferred in a single forward pass, suggesting a promising direction for scalable driving perception. We therefore propose a label-free, teacher-guided framework for learning autonomous driving representations directly from unposed videos. Unlike prior self-supervised approaches that focus primarily on frame-to-frame consistency, we posit that safe and reactive driving depends critically on temporal context. To this end, we leverage a feedforward architecture equipped with a lightweight autoregressive module, trained using multi-modal supervisory signals that guide the model to jointly predict current and future point maps, camera poses, semantic segmentation, and motion masks. Multi-modal teachers provide sequence-level pseudo-supervision, enabling LFG to learn a unified pseudo-4D representation from raw YouTube videos without poses, labels, or LiDAR. The resulting encoder not only transfers effectively to downstream autonomous driving planning on the NAVSIM benchmark, surpassing multi-camera and LiDAR baselines with only a single monocular camera, but also yields strong performance when evaluated on a range of semantic, geometric, and qualitative motion prediction tasks. These geometry and motion-aware features position LFG as a compelling video-centric foundation model for autonomous driving.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized inference across diverse natural language tasks, with larger models performing better but at higher computational costs. We propose a confidence-driven strategy that dynamically selects the most suitable model based on confidence estimates. By assessing a model's confidence in handling the task and response accuracy, tasks that are likely to be solved correctly are retained, while more uncertain or complex cases are delegated to a larger model, ensuring reliability while minimizing computation. Specifically, we evaluate a model's likelihood of knowing the correct answer and the probability that its response is accurate. Experiments on the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark show that our approach achieves accuracy comparable to the largest model while reducing computational costs by 20\\% to 40\\%. When applied to GPT-4o API calls, it reduces token usage by approximately 60\\%, further improving cost efficiency. These findings indicate the potential of confidence-based model selection to enhance real-world LLM deployment, particularly in resource-constrained settings such as edge devices and commercial API applications.",

    "title": "Force Policy: Learning Hybrid Force-Position Control Policy under Interaction Frame for Contact-Rich Manipulation",
    "abstract": "Contact-rich manipulation demands human-like integration of perception and force feedback: vision should guide task progress, while high-frequency interaction control must stabilize contact under uncertainty. Existing learning-based policies often entangle these roles in a monolithic network, trading off global generalization against stable local refinement, while control-centric approaches typically assume a known task structure or learn only controller parameters rather than the structure itself. In this paper, we formalize a physically grounded interaction frame, an instantaneous local basis that decouples force regulation from motion execution, and propose a method to recover it from demonstrations. Based on this, we address both issues by proposing Force Policy, a global-local vision-force policy in which a global policy guides free-space actions using vision, and upon contact, a high-frequency local policy with force feedback estimates the interaction frame and executes hybrid force-position control for stable interaction. Real-world experiments across diverse contact-rich tasks show consistent gains over strong baselines, with more robust contact establishment, more accurate force regulation, and reliable generalization to novel objects with varied geometries and physical properties, ultimately improving both contact stability and execution quality.

These omnipresent interactions must also be accurately included in machine-learned force fields. The many-body dispersion (MBD) method stands out as one of the most accurate and transferable approaches to capture vdW interactions, requiring only atomic $C_6$ coefficients and polarizabilities as input. We present MBD-ML, a pretrained message passing neural network that predicts these atomic properties directly from atomic structures. Through seamless integration with libMBD, our method enables the immediate calculation of MBD-inclusive total energies, forces, and stress tensors.

    "abstract": "Social interactions are fundamental to well-being, yet automatically detecting them in daily life-particularly using wearables-remains underexplored. Most existing systems are evaluated in controlled settings, focus primarily on in-person interactions, or rely on restrictive assumptions (e.g., requiring multiple speakers within fixed temporal windows), limiting generalizability to real-world use. We present an on-watch interaction detection system designed to capture diverse interactions in naturalistic settings. A core component is a foreground speech detector trained on a public dataset. Evaluated on over 100,000 labeled foreground speech and background sound instances, the detector achieves a balanced accuracy of 85.51%, outperforming prior work by 5.11%.   We evaluated the system in a real-world deployment (N=38), with over 900 hours of total smartwatch wear time. The system detected 1,691 interactions, 77.28% were confirmed via participant self-report, with durations ranging from under one minute to over one hour. Among correct detections, 81.45% were in-person, 15.7% virtual, and 1.85% hybrid. Leveraging participant-labeled data, we further developed a multimodal model achieving a balanced accuracy of 90.36% and a sensitivity of 91.17% on 33,698 labeled 15-second windows. These results demonstrate the feasibility of real-world interaction sensing and open the door to adaptive, context-aware systems responding to users' dynamic social environments.",

    "abstract": "A class of causal effect functionals requires integration over conditional densities of continuous variables, as in mediation effects and nonparametric identification in causal graphical models. Estimating such densities and evaluating the resulting integrals can be statistically and computationally demanding. A common workaround is to discretize the variable and replace integrals with finite sums. Although convenient, discretization alters the population-level functional and can induce non-negligible approximation bias, even under correct identification. Under smoothness conditions, we show that this coarsening bias is first order in the bin width and arises at the level of the target functional, distinct from statistical estimation error. We propose a simple bias-reduced functional that evaluates the outcome regression at within-bin conditional means, eliminating the leading term and yielding a second-order approximation error. We derive plug-in and one-step estimators for the bias-reduced functional. Simulations demonstrate substantial bias reduction and near-nominal confidence interval coverage, even under coarse binning. Our results provide a simple framework for controlling the impact of variable discretization on parameter approximation and estimation.",

    "abstract": "Research on Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) in industrial environments requires experimental platforms that support realistic end-to-end attack emulation across converged enterprise IT, operational technology (OT), and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) networks. However, existing industrial cybersecurity testbeds typically focus on isolated IT or OT domains or single-stage attacks, limiting their suitability for studying multi-stage APT campaigns. This paper presents the design, implementation, and validation of SIMPLE-ICS, a virtualised industrial enterprise testbed that enables emulation of multi-stage APT campaigns across IT, OT, and IIoT environments. The testbed architecture is based on the Purdue Enterprise Reference Architecture, NIST SP 800-82, and IEC 62443 zoning principles and integrates enterprise services, industrial control protocols, and digital twin based process simulation. A systematic methodology inspired by the V model is used to derive architectural requirements, attack scenarios, and validation criteria. An APT campaign designed to mimic the BlackEnergy campaign is emulated using MITRE ATTACK techniques spanning initial enterprise compromise, credential abuse, lateral movement, OT network infiltration, and process manipulation. The testbed supports the synchronised collection of network traffic, host-level logs, and operational telemetry across all segments. The testbed is validated on multi-stage attack trace observability, logging completeness across IT, OT, and IIoT domains, and repeatable execution of APT campaigns. The SIMPLE-ICS testbed provides an experimental platform for studying end-to-end APT behaviours in industrial enterprise networks and for generating multi-source datasets to support future research on campaign-level detection and correlation methods.",

When the number of simultaneous active users is less than or equal to w, such a code is able to provide a hard guarantee that each active user has a successful transmission within every consecutive L time slots. Recently, CACs were extended to multichannel CAcs (MC-CACs) over M orthogonal channels with the aim of increasing the number of potential users that can be supported. While most existing results on MC-CAC are derived under the assumption that M is not less than w, this paper focuses on the case that M is less than w, which is more relevant to practical application scenarios. In this paper, we first introduce the concept of exceptional codewords in MC-CACs. By employing some techniques from additive combinatorics, we derive a series of optimal MC-CACs. Along the way, several previously known optimal CAC results are generalized. Finally, our results extend naturally to AM-OPPTS MC-CACs and mixed-weight MC-CACs, two classes of relevant codes.",

We generate verbal feedback by analyzing spatio-temporal joint data and mapping features to natural-language coaching cues via a Large Language Model (LLM).

    "abstract": "Precise Event Spotting aims to localize fast-paced actions or events in videos with high temporal precision, a key task for applications in sports analytics, robotics, and autonomous systems. Existing methods typically process all frames uniformly, overlooking the inherent spatio-temporal redundancy in video data. This leads to redundant computation on non-informative regions while limiting overall efficiency. To remain tractable, they often spatially downsample inputs, losing fine-grained details crucial for precise localization. To address these limitations, we propose \\textbf{AdaSpot}, a simple yet effective framework that processes low-resolution videos to extract global task-relevant features while adaptively selecting the most informative region-of-interest in each frame for high-resolution processing. The selection is performed via an unsupervised, task-aware strategy that maintains spatio-temporal consistency across frames and avoids the training instability of learnable alternatives. This design preserves essential fine-grained visual cues with a marginal computational overhead compared to low-resolution-only baselines, while remaining far more efficient than uniform high-resolution processing. Experiments on standard PES benchmarks demonstrate that \\textbf{AdaSpot} achieves state-of-the-art performance under strict evaluation metrics (\\eg, $+3.96$ and $+2.26$ mAP$@0$ frames on Tennis and FineDiving), while also maintaining strong results under looser metrics.

We introduce a handcrafted, richly annotated ToM dataset, including classic and perturbed false belief tasks, the corresponding spaces of valid reasoning chains for correct task completion, subsequent reasoning faithfulness, task solutions, and propose metrics to evaluate reasoning chain correctness and to what extent final answers are faithful to reasoning traces of the generated CoT. We show a steep drop in ToM capabilities under task perturbation for all evaluated LLMs, questioning the notion of any robust form of ToM being present. While CoT prompting improves the ToM performance overall in a faithful manner, it surprisingly degrades accuracy for some perturbation classes, indicating that selective application is necessary.",

    "abstract": "Large language models are increasingly used in decision-making tasks that require them to process information from a variety of sources, including both human experts and other algorithmic agents. How do LLMs weigh the information provided by these different sources? We consider the well-studied phenomenon of algorithm aversion, in which human decision-makers exhibit bias against predictions from algorithms. Drawing upon experimental paradigms from behavioural economics, we evaluate how eightdifferent LLMs delegate decision-making tasks when the delegatee is framed as a human expert or an algorithmic agent. To be inclusive of different evaluation formats, we conduct our study with two task presentations: stated preferences, modeled through direct queries about trust towards either agent, and revealed preferences, modeled through providing in-context examples of the performance of both agents. When prompted to rate the trustworthiness of human experts and algorithms across diverse tasks, LLMs give higher ratings to the human expert, which correlates with prior results from human respondents. However, when shown the performance of a human expert and an algorithm and asked to place an incentivized bet between the two, LLMs disproportionately choose the algorithm, even when it performs demonstrably worse. These discrepant results suggest that LLMs may encode inconsistent biases towards humans and algorithms, which need to be carefully considered when they are deployed in high-stakes scenarios. Furthermore, we discuss the sensitivity of LLMs to task presentation formats that should be broadly scrutinized in evaluation robustness for AI safety.",

Recent advances in partial grounding have addressed this challenge by incrementally grounding only the most promising operators, guided by predictive models. However, these approaches primarily rely on relational features or learned embeddings and do not leverage the textual and structural cues present in PDDL descriptions. We propose SPG-LLM, which uses LLMs to analyze the domain and problem files to heuristically identify potentially irrelevant objects, actions, and predicates prior to grounding, significantly reducing the size of the grounded task. Across seven hard-to-ground benchmarks, SPG-LLM achieves faster grounding-often by orders of magnitude-while delivering comparable or better plan costs in some domains.",

Generated by a shared auxiliary feature-fusion module that captures cross-variable dependencies, these surrogates are mapped to TSFM-compatible series via the forecasting objective. The symmetric structure enables parameter-free reconstruction of final predictions directly from the surrogates, without additional parametric decoding.

    "abstract": "Generative models for quantum data pose significant challenges but hold immense potential in fields such as chemoinformatics and quantum physics. Quantum denoising diffusion probabilistic models (QuDDPMs) enable efficient learning of quantum data distributions by progressively scrambling and denoising quantum states; however, existing implementations typically rely on circuit-based random unitary dynamics that can be costly to realize and sensitive to control imperfections, particularly on analog quantum hardware. We propose the chaotic quantum diffusion model, a framework that generates projected ensembles via chaotic Hamiltonian time evolution, providing a flexible and hardware-compatible diffusion mechanism. Requiring only global, time-independent control, our approach substantially reduces implementation overhead across diverse analog quantum platforms while achieving accuracy comparable to QuDDPMs. This method improves trainability and robustness, broadening the applicability of quantum generative modeling.",

    "abstract": "Neural operators have emerged as an efficient paradigm for solving PDEs, overcoming the limitations of traditional numerical methods and significantly improving computational efficiency. However, due to the diversity and complexity of PDE systems, existing neural operators typically rely on a single network architecture, which limits their capacity to fully capture heterogeneous features and complex system dependencies. This constraint poses a bottleneck for large-scale PDE pre-training based on neural operators. To address these challenges, we propose a large-scale PDE pre-trained neural operator based on a nested Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework. In particular, the image-level MoE is designed to capture global dependencies, while the token-level Sub-MoE focuses on local dependencies. Our model can selectively activate the most suitable expert networks for a given input, thereby enhancing generalization and transferability. We conduct large-scale pre-training on twelve PDE datasets from diverse sources and successfully transfer the model to downstream tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",

    "abstract": "Generative manipulation policies can fail catastrophically under deployment-time distribution shift, yet many failures are near-misses: the robot reaches almost-correct poses and would succeed with a small corrective motion. We present FlowCorrect, a deployment-time correction framework that converts near-miss failures into successes using sparse human nudges, without full policy retraining. During execution, a human provides brief corrective pose nudges via a lightweight VR interface. FlowCorrect uses these sparse corrections to locally adapt the policy, improving actions without retraining the backbone while preserving the model performance on previously learned scenarios. We evaluate on a real-world robot across three tabletop tasks: pick-and-place, pouring, and cup uprighting. With a low correction budget, FlowCorrect improves success on hard cases by 85\\% while preserving performance on previously solved scenarios. The results demonstrate clearly that FlowCorrect learns only with very few demonstrations and enables fast and sample-efficient incremental, human-in-the-loop corrections of generative visuomotor policies at deployment time in real-world robotics.",

    "abstract": "Accurate prediction of shaft rotational speed, shaft power, and fuel consumption is crucial for enhancing operational efficiency and sustainability in maritime transportation. Conventional physics-based models provide interpretability but struggle with real-world variability, while purely data-driven approaches achieve accuracy at the expense of physical plausibility. This paper introduces a Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (PI-KAN), a hybrid method that integrates interpretable univariate feature transformations with a physics-informed loss function and a leakage-free chained prediction pipeline. Using operational and environmental data from five cargo vessels, PI-KAN consistently outperforms the traditional polynomial method and neural network baselines. The model achieves the lowest mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE), and the highest coefficient of determination (R^2) for shaft power and fuel consumption across all vessels, while maintaining physically consistent behavior. Interpretability analysis reveals rediscovery of domain-consistent dependencies, such as cubic-like speed-power relationships and cosine-like wave and wind effects. These results demonstrate that PI-KAN achieves both predictive accuracy and interpretability, offering a robust tool for vessel performance monitoring and decision support in operational settings.",

AutoSew formulates the problem as a graph matching task, leveraging a Graph Neural Network to capture local and global geometric context, and employing a differentiable optimal transport solver to infer stitching relationships-including multi-edge connections. To support this task, we update the GarmentCodeData dataset modifying over 18k patterns with realistic multi-edge annotations, reflecting industrial assembly scenarios. AutoSew achieves 96% F1-score and successfully assembles 73.3% of test garments without error, outperforming existing methods while relying solely on geometric input. Our results demonstrate that geometry alone can robustly guide stitching prediction, enabling scalable garment assembly without manual input.",

We articulate three prominent values in these texts - universality, objectivity, and efficiency - and examine how these values permeate visualization tools, curricula, and research practices. We situate these values within a broader set of critiques that call for more diverse priorities and viewpoints.

Findings reveal that technologies originate in scientific literature before reaching patents and social media, following traditional technology transfer patterns. While social media sentiment remains overwhelmingly bullish even during crypto winters, scientific and patent activity grow independently of market fluctuations, tracking overall market expansion in a virtuous cycle where research precedes and enables economic growth that funds further innovation.

To get the most out of every byte, practitioners and theorists have introduced the framework of maximal recoverability (MR) to study optimal error-correcting codes in various architectures. In this survey, we dive into the study of two families of MR codes: MR locally recoverable codes (LRCs) (also known as partial MDS codes) and grid codes (GCs).   For each of these two families of codes, we discuss the primary recoverability guarantees as well as what is known concerning optimal constructions. Along the way, we discuss many surprising connections between MR codes and broader questions in computer science and mathematics. For MR LRCs, the use of skew polynomial codes has unified many previous constructions. For MR GCs, the theory of higher order MDS codes shows that MR GCs can be used to construct optimal list-decodable codes. Furthermore, the optimally recoverable patterns of MR GCs have close ties to long-standing problems on the structural rigidity of graphs.",

Even though metrics of responsibility tailored to spatial interactions have been proposed, they are mostly focused on the responsibility of individual agents. Metrics of causal responsibility focusing on individuals fail in cases of causal overdeterminism -- when many actors simultaneously cause an outcome. To fill the gaps in causal responsibility left by individual-focused metrics, we formulate a metric for the causal responsibility of groups. To identify assertive agents that are causally responsible for the trajectory of an affected agent, we further formalise the types of assertive influences and propose a tiering algorithm for systematically identifying assertive agents. Finally, we use scenario-based simulations to illustrate the benefits of considering groups and how the emergence of group effects vary with interaction dynamics and the proximity of agents.",

    "abstract": "Low-resource automatic speech recognition (ASR) continues to pose significant challenges, primarily due to the limited availability of transcribed data for numerous languages. While a wealth of spoken content is accessible in television dramas and online videos, Taiwanese Hokkien exemplifies this issue, with transcriptions often being scarce and the majority of available subtitles provided only in Mandarin. To address this deficiency, we introduce TG-ASR for Taiwanese Hokkien drama speech recognition, a translation-guided ASR framework that utilizes multilingual translation embeddings to enhance recognition performance in low-resource environments. The framework is centered around the parallel gated cross-attention (PGCA) mechanism, which adaptively integrates embeddings from various auxiliary languages into the ASR decoder. This mechanism facilitates robust cross-linguistic semantic guidance while ensuring stable optimization and minimizing interference between languages. To support ongoing research initiatives, we present YT-THDC, a 30-hour corpus of Taiwanese Hokkien drama speech with aligned Mandarin subtitles and manually verified Taiwanese Hokkien transcriptions. Comprehensive experiments and analyses identify the auxiliary languages that most effectively enhance ASR performance, achieving a 14.77% relative reduction in character error rate and demonstrating the efficacy of translation-guided learning for underrepresented languages in practical applications.",

This oracle reflects the FL clients' capacity to collaboratively decrypt the aggregated result without knowing the secret key. This work surveys the use of threshold RLWE-based HE for federated average aggregation and examines the performance impact of using smudging noise with a large variance as a countermeasure.

To overcome this limitation, we propose a new RGB-Thermal RMOT task, named RT-RMOT, which aims to fuse RGB appearance features with the illumination robustness of the thermal modality to enable all-day referring multi-object tracking. To promote research on RT-RMOT, we construct the first Referring Multi-Object Tracking dataset under RGB-Thermal modality, named RefRT.

Furthermore, we propose RTrack, a framework built upon a multimodal large language model (MLLM) that integrates RGB, thermal, and textual features. Since the initial framework still leaves room for improvement, we introduce a Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) strategy to further exploit the model's potential. To alleviate training instability during RL fine-tuning, we introduce a Clipped Advantage Scaling (CAS) strategy to suppress gradient explosion. In addition, we design Structured Output Reward and Comprehensive Detection Reward to balance exploration and exploitation, thereby improving the completeness and accuracy of target perception.

However, most existing RL-based MFD approaches do not fully exploit RL's sequential decision-making strengths, often treating MFD as a simple guessing game (Contextual Bandits). To bridge this gap, we formulate MFD as an offline inverse reinforcement learning problem, where the agent learns the reward dynamics directly from healthy operational sequences, thereby bypassing the need for manual reward engineering and fault labels. Our framework employs Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning to train a discriminator that distinguishes between normal (expert) and policy-generated transitions. The discriminator's learned reward serves as an anomaly score, indicating deviations from normal operating behaviour. When evaluated on three run-to-failure benchmark datasets (HUMS2023, IMS, and XJTU-SY), the model consistently assigns low anomaly scores to normal samples and high scores to faulty ones, enabling early and robust fault detection. By aligning RL's sequential reasoning with MFD's temporal structure, this work opens a path toward RL-based diagnostics in data-driven industrial settings.",

To tackle these difficulties, we explore the integration of event cameras into the perception system, leveraging their advantages in low-light conditions, high-speed scenarios, and low power consumption. Specifically, we focus on Kilometer Marker Recognition (KMR), a critical task for autonomous metro localization under GNSS-denied conditions. In this context, we propose a robust baseline method based on a pre-trained RGB OCR foundation model, enhanced through multi-modal adaptation. Furthermore, we construct the first large-scale RGB-Event dataset, EvMetro5K, containing 5,599 pairs of synchronized RGB-Event samples, split into 4,479 training and 1,120 testing samples.

This work presents an LLM-assisted approach to detecting UX smells in Visual Studio Code by mining and classifying user-reported issues from the GitHub repository.

    "abstract": "Disease progression modeling provides a robust framework to identify long-term disease trajectories from short-term biomarker data. It is a valuable tool to gain a deeper understanding of diseases with a long disease trajectory, such as Alzheimer's disease. A key limitation of most disease progression models is that they are specific to a single data type (e.g., continuous data), thereby limiting their applicability to heterogeneous, real-world datasets. To address this limitation, we propose the Mixed Events model, a novel disease progression model that handles both discrete and continuous data types. This model is implemented within the Subtype and Stage Inference (SuStaIn) framework, resulting in Mixed-SuStaIn, enabling subtype and progression modeling. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Mixed-SuStaIn through simulation experiments and real-world data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, showing that it performs well on mixed datasets.

    "abstract": "As the complexity of the HPC storage stack rapidly grows, domain scientists face increasing challenges in effectively utilizing HPC storage systems to achieve their desired I/O performance. To identify and address I/O issues, scientists largely rely on I/O experts to analyze their I/O traces and provide insights into potential problems. However, with a limited number of I/O experts and the growing demand for data-intensive applications, inaccessibility has become a major bottleneck, hindering scientists from maximizing their productivity. Rapid advances in LLMs make it possible to build an automated tool that brings trustworthy I/O performance diagnosis to domain scientists. However, key challenges remain, such as the inability to handle long context windows, a lack of accurate domain knowledge about HPC I/O, and the generation of hallucinations during complex interactions.In this work, we propose IOAgent as a systematic effort to address these challenges. IOAgent integrates a module-based pre-processor, a RAG-based domain knowledge integrator, and a tree-based merger to accurately diagnose I/O issues from a given Darshan trace file. Similar to an I/O expert, IOAgent provides detailed justifications and references for its diagnoses and offers an interactive interface for scientists to ask targeted follow-up questions. To evaluate IOAgent, we collected a diverse set of labeled job traces and released the first open diagnosis test suite, TraceBench. Using this test suite, we conducted extensive evaluations, demonstrating that IOAgent matches or outperforms state-of-the-art I/O diagnosis tools with accurate and useful diagnosis results. We also show that IOAgent is not tied to specific LLMs, performing similarly well with both proprietary and open-source LLMs. We believe IOAgent has the potential to become a powerful tool for scientists navigating complex HPC I/O subsystems in the future.",

Various function-space variational inference (FSVI) regularisation methods have been presented, assigning meaningful priors over model predictions. However, these methods typically rely on a Gaussian prior, which fails to capture the heavy-tailed statistical characteristics inherent in neural network outputs. By contrast, this work proposes a novel function-space empirical Bayes regularisation framework -- termed ST-FS-EB -- which employs heavy-tailed Student's $t$ priors in both parameter and function spaces. Also, we approximate the posterior distribution through variational inference (VI), inducing an evidence lower bound (ELBO) objective based on Monte Carlo (MC) dropout. Furthermore, the proposed method is evaluated against various VI-based BDL baselines, and the results demonstrate its robust performance in in-distribution prediction, out-of-distribution (OOD) detection and handling distribution shifts.",

At the same time, state-of-the-art transformer models such as ModernBERT use very large pre-training datasets, which are driven by size rather than by diversity. This summons for an investigation of the impact of diversity on the ModernBERT pre-training. We do so in this study, with the express intent of reducing pre-training dataset size, while retaining at least comparable performance. We compare diversity-driven sampling algorithms, so as to pick the best one. We find that diversity-driven sampling allows in some tasks to gain 10 points relative to randomly-sampled pre-training data of commensurate size. We also see that a model pre-trained for 483h on a diversity-driven dataset of 150M tokens can yield a commensurate performance to a model pre-trained for 1,775h on a randomly-driven dataset of 2.4B tokens.",

    "abstract": "Vision-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (VisRAG) leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to jointly retrieve relevant visual documents and generate grounded answers based on multimodal evidence. However, existing VisRAG models degrade in performance when visual inputs suffer from distortions such as blur, noise, low light, or shadow, where semantic and degradation factors become entangled within pretrained visual encoders, leading to errors in both retrieval and generation stages. To address this limitation, we introduce RobustVisRAG, a causality-guided dual-path framework that improves VisRAG robustness while preserving efficiency and zero-shot generalization. RobustVisRAG uses a non-causal path to capture degradation signals through unidirectional attention and a causal path to learn purified semantics guided by these signals. Together with the proposed Non-Causal Distortion Modeling and Causal Semantic Alignment objectives, the framework enforces a clear separation between semantics and degradations, enabling stable retrieval and generation under challenging visual conditions. To evaluate robustness under realistic conditions, we introduce the Distortion-VisRAG dataset, a large-scale benchmark containing both synthetic and real-world degraded documents across seven domains, with 12 synthetic and 5 real distortion types that comprehensively reflect practical visual degradations. Experimental results show that RobustVisRAG improves retrieval, generation, and end-to-end performance by 7.35%, 6.35%, and 12.40%, respectively, on real-world degradations, while maintaining comparable accuracy on clean inputs.",

This allows an app developer to write once, and be able to run the web app on different servers or services.

However, existing approaches struggle to strike a balance between maintaining efficient, predictable future representations and preserving sufficient fine-grained information to guide precise action generation. To address this limitation, we propose WoG (World Guidance), a framework that maps future observations into compact conditions by injecting them into the action inference pipeline. The VLA is then trained to simultaneously predict these compressed conditions alongside future actions, thereby achieving effective world modeling within the condition space for action inference. We demonstrate that modeling and predicting this condition space not only facilitates fine-grained action generation but also exhibits superior generalization capabilities. Moreover, it learns effectively from substantial human manipulation videos. Extensive experiments across both simulation and real-world environments validate that our method significantly outperforms existing methods based on future prediction.

In such systems, the FES corresponds to basic data processing or packet routing, while SOS represents secondary tasks such as encryption, error checking, data compression, or deep packet inspection that may not be necessary for every packet. Here, we derive the bivariate probability generating functions for the joint distribution of the number of packets waiting for transmission and the number are being processed immediately after the completion of both the FES and SOS. Furthermore, the complete joint distribution at arbitrary time slots, including vacation completion states, is established. Numerical illustrations demonstrate the applicability of the proposed framework, including an example with discrete phase type service time distribution. Finally, the sensitivity analysis of the key parameters on marginal system's probabilities and different performance measures have been investigated through several graphical representations.",

    "title": "Parallel Continuous-Time Relative Localization with Augmented Clamped Non-Uniform B-Splines",
    "abstract": "Accurate relative localization is critical for multi-robot cooperation. In robot swarms, measurements from different robots arrive asynchronously and with clock time-offsets. Although Continuous-Time (CT) formulations have proved effective for handling asynchronous measurements in single-robot SLAM and calibration, extending CT methods to multi-robot settings faces great challenges to achieve high-accuracy, low-latency, and high-frequency performance. Especially, existing CT methods suffer from the inherent query-time delay of unclamped B-splines and high computational cost. This paper proposes CT-RIO, a novel Continuous-Time Relative-Inertial Odometry framework. We employ Clamped Non-Uniform B-splines (C-NUBS) to represent robot states for the first time, eliminating the query-time delay. We further augment C-NUBS with closed-form extension and shrinkage operations that preserve the spline shape, making it suitable for online estimation and enabling flexible knot management. This flexibility leads to the concept of knot-keyknot strategy, which supports spline extension at high-frequency while retaining sparse keyknots for adaptive relative-motion modeling. We then formulate a sliding-window relative localization problem that operates purely on relative kinematics and inter-robot constraints. To meet the demanding computation required at swarm scale, we decompose the tightly-coupled optimization into robot-wise sub-problems and solve them in parallel using incremental asynchronous block coordinate descent. Extensive experiments show that CT-RIO converges from time-offsets as large as 263 ms to sub-millisecond within 3 s, and achieves RMSEs of 0.046 m and 1.8 °. It consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with improvements of up to 60% under high-speed motion.",

    "abstract": "Models operating on dynamic physiologic signals must distinguish benign, label-preserving variability from true concept change. Existing concept-drift frameworks are largely distributional and provide no principled guidance on how much a model's internal representation may move when the underlying signal undergoes physiologically plausible fluctuations in energy. As a result, deep models often misinterpret harmless changes in amplitude, rate, or morphology as concept drift, yielding unstable predictions, particularly in multimodal fusion settings.   This study introduces Physiologic Energy Conservation Theory (PECT), an energy-based framework for concept stability in dynamic signals. PECT posits that under virtual drift, normalized latent displacement should scale proportionally with normalized signal energy change, while persistent violations of this proportionality indicate real concept drift. We operationalize this principle through Energy-Constrained Representation Learning (ECRL), a lightweight regularizer that penalizes energy-inconsistent latent movement without modifying encoder architectures or adding inference-time cost.   Although PECT is formulated for dynamic signals in general, we instantiate and evaluate it on multimodal ECG across seven unimodal and hybrid models. Experiments show that in the strongest trimodal hybrid (1D+2D+Transformer), clean accuracy is largely preserved (96.0% to 94.1%), while perturbed accuracy improves substantially (72.6% to 85.5%) and fused representation drift decreases by over 45%. Similar trends are observed across all architectures, providing empirical evidence that PECT functions as an energy-drift law governing concept stability in continuous physiologic signals.",

    "abstract": "River systems operate as inherently interconnected continuous networks, meaning river hydrodynamic simulation ought to be a systemic process. However, widespread hydrology data scarcity often restricts data-driven forecasting to isolated predictions. To achieve systemic simulation and reduce reliance on river observations, we present GraphRiverCast (GRC), a topology-informed AI foundation model designed to simulate multivariate river hydrodynamics in global river systems. GRC is capable of operating in a \"ColdStart\" mode, generating predictions without relying on historical river states for initialization. In 7-day global pseudo-hindcasts, GRC-ColdStart functions as a robust standalone simulator, achieving a Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) of approximately 0.82 without exhibiting the significant error accumulation typical of autoregressive paradigms. Ablation studies reveal that topological encoding serves as indispensable structural information in the absence of historical states, explicitly guiding hydraulic connectivity and network-scale mass redistribution to reconstruct flow dynamics. Furthermore, when adapted locally via a pre-training and fine-tuning strategy, GRC consistently outperforms physics-based and locally-trained AI baselines. Crucially, this superiority extends from gauged reaches to full river networks, underscoring the necessity of topology encoding and physics-based pre-training. Built on a physics-aligned neural operator architecture, GRC enables rapid and cross-scale adaptive simulation, establishing a collaborative paradigm bridging global hydrodynamic knowledge with local hydrological reality.",

This approach not only provides the Wasserstein geodesic but also recovers the OT map, enabling direct sampling from the target distribution. By estimating the OT map, we obtain velocity estimates along particle trajectories, which in turn allow us to learn the full velocity field.

To address these issues, we propose a scalable LLM-based unit test generation method. Our approach consists of two key steps. The first step is context information retrieval, which uses both LLMs and static analysis to gather relevant contextual information associated with the complex methods under test. The second step, iterative test generation with code elimination, repeatedly generates unit tests for the code slice, tracks the achieved coverage, and selectively removes code segments that have already been covered. This process simplifies the testing task and mitigates issues arising from token limits or reduced reasoning effectiveness associated with excessively long contexts. Through comprehensive evaluations on open-source projects, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based and search-based methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in achieving high coverage on complex methods.",

    "abstract": "Numerical simulations of contaminant dispersion, as after a gas leakage incident on a chemical plant, can provide valuable insights for both emergency response and preparedness. Simulation approaches combine incompressible Navier-Stokes (INS) equations with advection-diffusion (AD) processes to model wind and concentration field. However, the computational cost of such high-fidelity simulations increases rapidly for complex geometries like urban environments, making them unfeasible in time-critical or multi-query \"what-if\" scenarios. Therefore, this study focuses on the application of model order reduction (MOR) techniques enabling fast yet accurate predictions. To this end, a thorough comparison of intrusive and non-intrusive MOR methods is performed for the computationally more demanding parametric INS problem with varying wind velocities. Based on these insights, a non-intrusive reduced-order model (ROM) is constructed accounting for both wind velocity and direction. The study is conducted on a two-dimensional domain derived from real-world building footprints, preserving key features for analyzing the dispersion of, for instance, denser contaminants. The resulting ROM enables faster than real-time predictions of spatio-temporal contaminant dispersion from an instantaneous source under varying wind conditions. This capability allows assessing wind measurement uncertainties through a Monte Carlo analysis. To demonstrate the practical applicability, an interactive dashboard provides intuitive access to simulation results.",

    "abstract": "The optimization of complex medical appointment scheduling remains a significant operational challenge in multi-center healthcare environments, where clinical safety protocols and patient logistics must be reconciled. This study proposes and evaluates a Genetic Algorithm (GA) framework designed to automate the scheduling of multiple medical acts while adhering to rigorous inter-procedural incompatibility rules. Using a synthetic dataset encompassing 50 medical acts across four healthcare facilities, we compared two GA variants, Pre-Ordered and Unordered, against deterministic First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) and Random Choice baselines. Our results demonstrate that the GA framework achieved a 100% constraint fulfillment rate, effectively resolving temporal overlaps and clinical incompatibilities that the FCFS baseline failed to address in 60% and 40% of cases, respectively. Furthermore, the GA variants demonstrated statistically significant improvements (p < 0.001) in patient-centric metrics, achieving an Idle Time Ratio (ITR) frequently below 0.4 and reducing inter-healthcenter trips. While the GA (Ordered) variant provided a superior initial search locus, both evolutionary models converged to comparable global optima by the 100th generation. These findings suggest that transitioning from manual, human-mediated scheduling to an automated metaheuristic approach enhances clinical integrity, reduces administrative overhead, and significantly improves the patient experience by minimizing wait times and logistical burdens.",

    "abstract": "360 panoramic images are increasingly used in virtual reality, autonomous driving, and robotics for holistic scene understanding. However, current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with 3D spatial reasoning on Equirectangular Projection (ERP) images due to geometric distortion and limited 3D supervision. We introduce PanoEnv, a large-scale VQA benchmark built from synthetic 3D environments, containing 14.8K questions across five categories (e.g., relative position, volume comparison) grounded in accurate 3D annotations including depth, segmentation, and bounding boxes. Benchmarking 14 state-of-the-art VLMs reveals limited 3D understanding, achieving only 49.34% overall accuracy and 8.36% on open-ended (OE) questions. To enhance 3D reasoning, we propose a reinforcement learning post-training framework based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a ground-truth-guided reward that incorporates five geometry-aware strategies such as distance tolerance and spatial consistency. A two-stage curriculum further mitigates catastrophic forgetting: Stage 1 trains on structured tasks (true/false and multiple choice), and Stage 2 fine-tunes on mixed open-ended data to improve generalization. Our 7B model achieves new state-of-the-art performance, improving overall accuracy to 52.93% (+3.59%) and open-ended accuracy to 14.83% while maintaining structured-task performance. It also achieves top semantic evaluation scores (Q-Score 6.24, P-Score 5.95), surpassing 32B models. These results demonstrate that PanoEnv-QA and our curriculum-based RL framework effectively instill 3D spatial intelligence in VLMs for omnidirectional perception.",

    "abstract": "Peer review remains a cornerstone in academia, yet it frequently falls short in fostering joint progress and well-being. While peer review primarily emphasizes scientific rigor, it often lacks the empathy essential for supporting and encouraging all peers involved. In this experience report, I aim to highlight that peer review is a practice that demands both scientific care for quality and collegial welfare for the joint progress and well-being of all peers involved, including authors, co-reviewers, workshop or conference organizers, and journal editors. Drawing on my ten years of experience in academia, I propose the ethos of the PEERfect REVIEWer, grounded in the two core values: Scientific care and collegial welfare. Through reflection shaped by professional exchanges with colleagues, consideration of literature, and an examination of both self-authored and received reviews, I formulated an accompanying guideline with 16 practical recommendations to guide reviewers in their actions to achieve these two values. The ethos of the PEERfect REVIEWer and its accompanying guideline help reviewers in upholding high scientific standards and conducting peer review in a constructive, supportive, respectful, and timely manner. They demonstrate that scientific rigor and empathy are complementary forces that promote impactful peer review practice. By placing scientific care and collegial welfare at the core of peer review, this experience report reaffirms the importance of scientific rigor while also advocating for greater attention to empathy. It invites reviewers to reconsider their role not merely as gatekeepers but as partners in the academic journey of each peer involved. The PEERfect REVIEWer is both a caretaker of quality and a steward of joint progress and well-being - as truly impactful peer review practice requires scientific rigor and empathy in equal measure.",

We propose a simple, hyperparameter-free method to address stiffness by normalizing loss residuals with the Jacobian. We provide theoretical indications that Jacobian-based normalization can improve gradient descent and validate it on benchmark stiff ordinary differential equations. We then apply it to a realistic system: the stiff Boltzmann equations (BEs) governing weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) dark matter (DM). Our approach achieves higher accuracy than attention mechanisms previously proposed for handling stiffness, recovering the full solution where prior methods fail. This is further demonstrated in an inverse problem with a single experimental data point - the observed DM relic density - where our inverse PINNs correctly infer the cross section that solves the BEs in both Standard and alternative cosmologies.",

    "abstract": "Medical images are essential for diagnosis, treatment planning, and research, but their quality is often degraded by noise from low-dose acquisition, patient motion, or scanner limitations, affecting both clinical interpretation and downstream analysis. Traditional filtering approaches often over-smooth and lose fine anatomical details, while deep learning methods, including CNNs, GANs, and transformers, may struggle to preserve such details or require large, computationally expensive models, limiting clinical practicality.   We propose PatchDenoiser, a lightweight, energy-efficient multi-scale patch-based denoising framework. It decomposes denoising into local texture extraction and global context aggregation, fused via a spatially aware patch fusion strategy. This design enables effective noise suppression while preserving fine structural and anatomical details. PatchDenoiser is ultra-lightweight, with far fewer parameters and lower computational complexity than CNN-, GAN-, and transformer-based denoisers.   On the 2016 Mayo Low-Dose CT dataset, PatchDenoiser consistently outperforms state-of-the-art CNN- and GAN-based methods in PSNR and SSIM. It is robust to variations in slice thickness, reconstruction kernels, and HU windows, generalizes across scanners without fine-tuning, and reduces parameters by ~9x and energy consumption per inference by ~27x compared with conventional CNN denoisers.   PatchDenoiser thus provides a practical, scalable, and computationally efficient solution for medical image denoising, balancing performance, robustness, and clinical deployability.",

    "abstract": "While prior work has focused on projecting adversarial examples back onto the manifold of natural data to restore safety, we argue that a comprehensive understanding of AI safety requires characterizing the unsafe regions themselves. This paper introduces a framework for systematically mapping the Manifold of Failure in Large Language Models (LLMs). We reframe the search for vulnerabilities as a quality diversity problem, using MAP-Elites to illuminate the continuous topology of these failure regions, which we term behavioral attraction basins. Our quality metric, Alignment Deviation, guides the search towards areas where the model's behavior diverges most from its intended alignment. Across three LLMs: Llama-3-8B, GPT-OSS-20B, and GPT-5-Mini, we show that MAP-Elites achieves up to 63% behavioral coverage, discovers up to 370 distinct vulnerability niches, and reveals dramatically different model-specific topological signatures: Llama-3-8B exhibits a near-universal vulnerability plateau (mean Alignment Deviation 0.93), GPT-OSS-20B shows a fragmented landscape with spatially concentrated basins (mean 0.73), and GPT-5-Mini demonstrates strong robustness with a ceiling at 0.50. Our approach produces interpretable, global maps of each model's safety landscape that no existing attack method (GCG, PAIR, or TAP) can provide, shifting the paradigm from finding discrete failures to understanding their underlying structure.",

In this work, we propose the Robot Gaze-Shift (RGS) framework, which integrates these two components into a unified pipeline. First, RGS employs a vision--language model (VLM)-based gaze reasoning pipeline to infer context-appropriate gaze targets from multimodal interaction cues, ensuring consistency with human gaze-orienting regularities. Second, RGS introduces a conditional Vector Quantized-Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) model for eye--head coordinated gaze-shift motion generation, producing diverse and human-like gaze-shift behaviors. Experiments validate that RGS effectively replicates human-like target selection and generates realistic, diverse gaze-shift motions.",

Most existing benchmarks focus on judging grammatical acceptability, whereas the ability to interpret meanings conveyed by grammatical forms has received much less attention. We introduce the Linguistic Minimal-Pair Benchmark for Evaluating Constructional Understanding in Language Models (CxMP), a benchmark grounded in Construction Grammar that treats form-meaning pairings, or constructions, as fundamental linguistic units. CxMP evaluates whether models can interpret the semantic relations implied by constructions, using a controlled minimal-pair design across nine construction types, including the let-alone, caused motion, and ditransitive constructions. Our results show that while syntactic competence emerges early, constructional understanding develops more gradually and remains limited even in large language models (LLMs). CxMP thus reveals persistent gaps in how language models integrate form and meaning, providing a framework for studying constructional understanding and learning trajectories in language models.",

    "abstract": "Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a leading technique for efficiently fine-tuning text-to-image diffusion models, and its widespread adoption on open-source platforms has fostered a vibrant culture of model sharing and customization. However, the same modular and plug-and-play flexibility that makes LoRA appealing also introduces a broader attack surface. To highlight this risk, we propose Masquerade-LoRA (MasqLoRA), the first systematic attack framework that leverages an independent LoRA module as the attack vehicle to stealthily inject malicious behavior into text-to-image diffusion models. MasqLoRA operates by freezing the base model parameters and updating only the low-rank adapter weights using a small number of \"trigger word-target image\" pairs. This enables the attacker to train a standalone backdoor LoRA module that embeds a hidden cross-modal mapping: when the module is loaded and a specific textual trigger is provided, the model produces a predefined visual output; otherwise, it behaves indistinguishably from the benign model, ensuring the stealthiness of the attack. Experimental results demonstrate that MasqLoRA can be trained with minimal resource overhead and achieves a high attack success rate of 99.8%. MasqLoRA reveals a severe and unique threat in the AI supply chain, underscoring the urgent need for dedicated defense mechanisms for the LoRA-centric sharing ecosystem.",

Each edge device employs hyperdimensional computing (HDC) for lightweight local training and applies differential privacy (DP) noise to protect transmitted model updates. The total energy consumption is minimized through a joint optimization of the HDC dimension, transmit power, and CPU frequency.

    "abstract": "In addition to the core tasks of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), active SLAM additionally in- volves generating robot actions that enable effective and efficient exploration of unknown environments. However, existing active SLAM pipelines are limited by three main factors. First, they inherit the restrictions of the underlying SLAM modules that they may be using. Second, their motion planning strategies are typically shortsighted and lack long-term vision. Third, most approaches struggle to handle dynamic scenes. To address these limitations, we propose a novel monocular active SLAM method, Dream-SLAM, which is based on dreaming cross-spatio-temporal images and semantically plausible structures of partially observed dynamic environments. The generated cross-spatio-temporal im- ages are fused with real observations to mitigate noise and data incompleteness, leading to more accurate camera pose estimation and a more coherent 3D scene representation. Furthermore, we integrate dreamed and observed scene structures to enable long- horizon planning, producing farsighted trajectories that promote efficient and thorough exploration. Extensive experiments on both public and self-collected datasets demonstrate that Dream-SLAM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in localization accuracy, mapping quality, and exploration efficiency.

Unlike classic ``Sponsored Search\", where an advertiser typically bids for a single link, these settings involve advertisers with broad catalogs of distinct products. In these auctions, a single advertiser can secure multiple slots simultaneously to promote different items within the same query. This creates a fundamental complexity: the allocation is combinatorial, as advertisers simultaneously win a bundle of slots rather than a single position.   We study this setting through the lens of autobidding, where value-maximizing agents employ uniform bidding strategies to optimize total value subject to Return-on-Investment (ROI) constraints. We analyze two prevalent auction formats: Generalized Second-Price (GSP) and Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG). Our first main contribution is establishing the universal existence of an Autobidding Equilibrium for both settings. Second, we prove a tight Price of Anarchy (PoA) of 2 for both mechanisms.",

We study compact spectral circulant and block-circulant-with-circulant-blocks (BCCB) layers: FFT-diagonalizable circular convolutions whose weights live directly in the real FFT (RFFT) half (1D) or half-plane (2D). Parameterizing filters in the frequency domain lets us impose simple spectral structure, perform structured variational inference in a low-dimensional weight space, and calculate exact layer spectral norms, enabling inexpensive global Lipschitz bounds and margin-based robustness diagnostics. By placing independent complex Gaussians on the Hermitian support we obtain a discrete instance of the spectral representation of stationary kernels, inducing an exact stationary Gaussian-process prior over filters on the discrete circle/torus. We exploit this to define a practical spectral prior and a Hermitian-aware low-rank-plus-diagonal variational posterior in real coordinates. Empirically, spectral circulant/BCCB layers are effective compact building blocks in both (variational) Bayesian and point estimate regimes: compact Bayesian neural networks on MNIST->Fashion-MNIST, variational heads on frozen CIFAR-10 features, and deterministic ViT projections on CIFAR-10/Tiny ImageNet; spectral layers match strong baselines while using substantially fewer parameters and with tighter Lipschitz certificates.",

We investigate three problems related to this model in arbitrary dimension in open space (no obstacles), where a configuration of the vehicle consists of its current position and the last-used vector. The three problems are the following. In Branching Cost (BC), given two configurations, the goal is to compute the minimum number of intermediate configurations (length of a trajectory) between the two configurations. Branching Trajectory (BT) has the same input and asks for a description of the corresponding trajectory. Multipoint Trajectory (MT) asks for an optimal trajectory that visits given points $p_1,\\dots,p_n$ in a prescribed order, starting and ending with zero-speed configurations.\\\\ We revisit known approaches to solve BC in 2D, showing that this problem can be solved in constant time in any fixed number of dimensions $d$ (more generally, in $O(d \\log d)$ time). We show that BT can also be solved in constant time for any fixed $d$, despite the fact that the length of the trajectory is not constant, by leveraging the fact that there always exists \\emph{one} optimal trajectory compactly represented by $O(1)$ intermediate configurations. For MT, we collect theoretical and experimental evidence that the speed cannot be trivially bounded; local decisions may be impacted by points that are arbitrarily far in the visit order; and an optimal trajectory may require significant excursions out of the convex hull of the points. We still establish conservative speed bounds that a natural dynamic programming (DP) algorithm can exploit to solve reasonably large instances efficiently.",

    "abstract": "The pose graph is a core component of Structure-from-Motion (SfM), where images act as nodes and edges encode relative poses. Since geometric verification is expensive, SfM pipelines restrict the pose graph to a sparse set of candidate edges, making initialization critical. Existing methods rely on image retrieval to connect each image to its $k$ nearest neighbors, treating pairs independently and ignoring global consistency. We address this limitation through the concept of edge prioritization, ranking candidate edges by their utility for SfM. Our approach has three components: (1) a GNN trained with SfM-derived supervision to predict globally consistent edge reliability; (2) multi-minimal-spanning-tree-based pose graph construction guided by these ranks; and (3) connectivity-aware score modulation that reinforces weak regions and reduces graph diameter. This globally informed initialization yields more reliable and compact pose graphs, improving reconstruction accuracy in sparse and high-speed settings and outperforming SOTA retrieval methods on ambiguous scenes.

    "abstract": "Federated recommendation facilitates collaborative model training across distributed clients while keeping sensitive user interaction data local. Conventional approaches typically rely on synchronizing high-dimensional item representations between the server and clients. This paradigm implicitly assumes that precise geometric alignment of embedding coordinates is necessary for collaboration across clients. We posit that establishing relative semantic relationships among items is more effective than enforcing shared representations. Specifically, global semantic relations serve as structural constraints for items. Within these constraints, the framework allows item representations to vary locally on each client, which flexibility enables the model to capture fine-grained user personalization while maintaining global consistency. To this end, we propose Cluster-Guided FedRec framework (CGFedRec), a framework that transforms uploaded embeddings into compact cluster labels. In this framework, the server functions as a global structure discoverer to learn item clusters and distributes only the resulting labels. This mechanism explicitly cuts off the downstream transmission of item embeddings, relieving clients from maintaining global shared item embeddings. Consequently, CGFedRec achieves the effective injection of global collaborative signals into local item representations without transmitting full embeddings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly improves communication efficiency while maintaining superior recommendation accuracy across multiple datasets.",

    "abstract": "Text Image Machine Translation (TIMT) aims to translate text embedded in images in the source-language into target-language, requiring synergistic integration of visual perception and linguistic understanding. Existing TIMT methods, whether cascaded pipelines or end-to-end multimodal large language models (MLLMs),struggle with high-resolution text-rich images due to cluttered layouts, diverse fonts, and non-textual distractions, resulting in text omission, semantic drift, and contextual inconsistency. To address these challenges, we propose GLoTran, a global-local dual visual perception framework for MLLM-based TIMT. GLoTran integrates a low-resolution global image with multi-scale region-level text image slices under an instruction-guided alignment strategy, conditioning MLLMs to maintain scene-level contextual consistency while faithfully capturing fine-grained textual details. Moreover, to realize this dual-perception paradigm, we construct GLoD, a large-scale text-rich TIMT dataset comprising 510K high-resolution global-local image-text pairs covering diverse real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GLoTran substantially improves translation completeness and accuracy over state-of-the-art MLLMs, offering a new paradigm for fine-grained TIMT under high-resolution and text-rich conditions.",

    "abstract": "Generation-based testing techniques have shown their effectiveness in detecting logic bugs of DBMS, which are often caused by improper implementation of query optimizers. Nonetheless, existing generation-based debug tools are limited to single-table queries and there is a substantial research gap regarding multi-table queries with join operators. In this paper, we propose TQS, a novel testing framework targeted at detecting logic bugs derived by queries involving multi-table joins. Given a target DBMS, TQS achieves the goal with two key components: Data-guided Schema and Query Generation (DSG) and Knowledge-guided Query Space Exploration (KQE). DSG addresses the key challenge of multi-table query debugging: how to generate ground-truth (query, result) pairs for verification. It adopts the database normalization technique to generate a testing schema and maintains a bitmap index for result tracking. To improve debug efficiency, DSG also artificially inserts some noises into the generated data. To avoid repetitive query space search, KQE forms the problem as isomorphic graph set discovery and combines the graph embedding and weighted random walk for query generation. We evaluated TQS on four popular DBMSs: MySQL, MariaDB, TiDB and the gray release of an industry-leading cloud-native database, anonymized as X-DB. Experimental results show that TQS is effective in finding logic bugs of join optimization in database management systems. It successfully detected 115 bugs within 24 hours, including 31 bugs in MySQL, 30 in MariaDB, 31 in TiDB, and 23 in X-DB respectively.",

    "abstract": "In Part I of this companion paper series, we introduced SWIFTraj, a new open-source vehicle trajectory dataset collected using a unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm. The dataset has two distinctive features. First, by connecting trajectories across consecutive UAV videos, it provides long-distance continuous trajectories, with the longest exceeding 4.5 km. Second, it covers an integrated traffic network consisting of both freeways and their connected urban roads. Obtaining such long-distance continuous trajectories from a UAV swarm is challenging, due to the need for accurate time alignment across multiple videos and the irregular spatial distribution of UAVs. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel graph-based approach for connecting vehicle trajectories captured by a UAV swarm. An undirected graph is constructed to represent flexible UAV layouts, and an automatic time alignment method based on trajectory matching cost minimization is developed to estimate optimal time offsets across videos. To associate trajectories of the same vehicle observed in different videos, a vehicle matching table is established using the Hungarian algorithm. The proposed approach is evaluated using both simulated and real-world data. Results from real-world experiments show that the time alignment error is within three video frames, corresponding to approximately 0.1 s, and that the vehicle matching achieves an F1-score of about 0.99. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in addressing key challenges in UAV-based trajectory connection and highlight its potential for large-scale vehicle trajectory collection.",

    "abstract": "Hierarchical quantum classifiers, such as quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs), represent recent progress toward designing effective and feasible architectures for quantum classification. However, their performance on near-term quantum hardware remains highly sensitive to noise accumulation across circuit depth, calling for strategies beyond circuit-architecture design alone. We propose a noise-adaptive hybrid QCNN that improves classification under noise by exploiting depth-stratified intermediate measurements. Instead of discarding qubits removed during pooling operations, we measure them and use the resulting outcomes as classical features that are jointly processed by a classical neural network. This hybrid hierarchical design enables noise-adaptive inference by integrating quantum intermediate measurements with classical post-processing. Systematic experiments across multiple circuit sizes and noise settings, including hardware-calibrated noise models derived from IBM Quantum backend data, demonstrate more stable convergence, reduced loss variability, and consistently higher classification accuracy compared with standard QCNNs. Moreover, we observe that this performance advantage significantly amplifies as the circuit size increases, confirming that the hybrid architecture mitigates the scaling limitations of standard architectures. Notably, the multi-basis measurement variant attains performance close to the noiseless limit even under realistic noise. While demonstrated for QCNNs, the proposed depth-stratified feature extraction applies more broadly to hierarchical quantum classifiers that progressively discard qubits.",

Although the recent approach utilizes future image to replace text as CoT process, it lacks clear planning-oriented objective guidance to generate images with accurate scene evolution. To address these, we innovatively propose MindDriver, a progressive multimodal reasoning framework that enables VLM to imitate human-like progressive thinking for autonomous driving. MindDriver presents semantic understanding, semantic-to-physical space imagination, and physical-space trajectory planning. To achieve aligned reasoning processes in MindDriver, we develop a feedback-guided automatic data annotation pipeline to generate aligned multimodal reasoning training data. Furthermore, we develop a progressive reinforcement fine-tuning method to optimize the alignment through progressive high- level reward-based learning.

However, prevailing generative paradigms are prone to memorizing surface-level co-occurrences rather than learning genuine relational semantics, limiting out-of-distribution generalization. To address this, we propose RADAR, which reformulates KGR from generative pattern matching to discriminative relational reasoning. We recast KGR as discriminative entity selection, where reinforcement learning enforces relative entity separability beyond token-likelihood imitation. Leveraging this separability, inference operates directly in representation space, ensuring consistency with the discriminative optimization and bypassing generation-induced hallucinations. Across four benchmarks, RADAR achieves 5-6% relative gains on link prediction and triple classification over strong LLM baselines, while increasing task-relevant mutual information in intermediate representations by 62.9%, indicating more robust and transferable relational reasoning.",

While top models often match or even outperform human experts on DDx generation, all MLLMs exhibit a much larger DDx--FDx performance gap compared to expert clinicians, indicating a failure mode in synthesis of heterogeneous CE types. Ablations attribute this failure to (i) overreliance on less discriminative textual CE ($\\it{e.g.}$, medical history) and (ii) a cross-modal CE utilization gap.

    "abstract": "When biological foundation models such as scGPT and Geneformer process single-cell gene expression, what geometric and topological structure forms in their internal representations? Is that structure biologically meaningful or a training artifact, and how confident should we be in such claims? We address these questions through autonomous large-scale hypothesis screening: an AI-driven executor-brainstormer loop that proposed, tested, and refined 141 geometric and topological hypotheses across 52 iterations, covering persistent homology, manifold distances, cross-model alignment, community structure, and directed topology, all with explicit null controls and disjoint gene-pool splits.   Three principal findings emerge. First, the models learn genuine geometric structure. Gene embedding neighborhoods exhibit non-trivial topology, with persistent homology significant in 11 of 12 transformer layers at p < 0.05 in the weakest domain and 12 of 12 in the other two. A multi-level distance hierarchy shows that manifold-aware metrics outperform Euclidean distance for identifying regulatory gene pairs, and graph community partitions track known transcription factor target relationships. Second, this structure is shared across independently trained models. CCA alignment between scGPT and Geneformer yields canonical correlation of 0.80 and gene retrieval accuracy of 72 percent, yet none of 19 tested methods reliably recover gene-level correspondences. The models agree on the global shape of gene space but not on precise gene placement. Third, the structure is more localized than it first appears. Under stringent null controls applied across all null families, robust signal concentrates in immune tissue, while lung and external lung signals weaken substantially.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate a problem of minimizing total energy consumption for secure federated learning (FL) over wireless edge networks. To address the high computational cost and privacy challenges in conventional FL with neural networks (NN) for resource-constrained users, we propose a novel FL with hyperdimensional computing and differential privacy (FL-HDC-DP) framework. In the considered model, each edge user employs hyperdimensional computing (HDC) for local training, which replaces complex neural updates with simple hypervector operations, and applies differential privacy (DP) noise to protect transmitted model information. We optimize the total energy of computation and communication under both latency and privacy constraints. We formulate the problem as an optimization that minimizes the total energy of all users by jointly allocating HDC dimension, transmission time, system bandwidth, transmit power, and CPU frequency. To solve this problem, a sigmoid-variant function is proposed to characterize the relationship between the HDC dimension and the convergence rounds required to reach a target accuracy. Based on this model, we develop two alternating optimization algorithms, where closed-form expressions for time, frequency, bandwidth, and power allocations are derived at each iteration. Since the iterative algorithm requires a feasible initialization, we construct a feasibility problem and obtain feasible initial resource parameters by solving a per round transmission time minimization problem. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed FL-HDC-DP framework achieves up to 83.3% total energy reduction compared with the baseline, while attaining about 90% accuracy in approximately 3.5X fewer communication rounds than the NN baseline.",

The most used technique employed in Bayesian GAN is Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), but it is computationally intensive, particularly in terms of weight storage. In this paper, we introduce Gaussian Approximation of CTGAN (GACTGAN), an integration of the Bayesian posterior approximation technique using Stochastic Weight Averaging-Gaussian (SWAG) within the CTGAN generator to synthesise tabular data, reducing computational overhead after the training phase.

Models produce ranges far wider than true confidence intervals yet still fail to contain the true algorithmic mean in the majority of instances; most perform worse than random guessing and the marginal above-random performance of the best model is most consistent with benchmark memorization rather than principled reasoning.

    "title": "Learning to Fuse and Reconstruct Multi-View Graphs for Diabetic Retinopathy Grading",
    "abstract": "Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the leading causes of vision loss worldwide, making early and accurate DR grading critical for timely intervention. Recent clinical practices leverage multi-view fundus images for DR detection with a wide coverage of the field of view (FOV), motivating deep learning methods to explore the potential of multi-view learning for DR grading. However, existing methods often overlook the inter-view correlations when fusing multi-view fundus images, failing to fully exploit the inherent consistency across views originating from the same patient. In this work, we present MVGFDR, an end-to-end Multi-View Graph Fusion framework for DR grading. Different from existing methods that directly fuse visual features from multiple views, MVGFDR is equipped with a novel Multi-View Graph Fusion (MVGF) module to explicitly disentangle the shared and view-specific visual features. Specifically, MVGF comprises three key components: (1) Multi-view Graph Initialization, which constructs visual graphs via residual-guided connections and employs Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) coefficients as frequency-domain anchors; (2) Multi-view Graph Fusion, which integrates selective nodes across multi-view graphs based on frequency-domain relevance to capture complementary view-specific information; and (3) Masked Cross-view Reconstruction, which leverages masked reconstruction of shared information across views to facilitate view-invariant representation learning. Extensive experimental results on MFIDDR, by far the largest multi-view fundus image dataset, demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach over existing state-of-the-art approaches in diabetic retinopathy grading.",

    "abstract": "Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a major cause of vision impairment worldwide. However, manual diagnosis is often time-consuming and prone to errors, leading to delays in screening. This paper presents a lightweight automated deep learning framework for efficient assessment of DR severity from digital fundus images. We use a MobileNetV3 architecture with a Consistent Rank Logits (CORAL) head to model the ordered progression of disease while maintaining computational efficiency for resource-constrained environments. The model is trained and validated on a combined dataset of APTOS 2019 and IDRiD images using a preprocessing pipeline including circular cropping and illumination normalization. Extensive experiments including 3-fold cross-validation and ablation studies demonstrate strong performance. The model achieves a Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK) score of 0.9019 and an accuracy of 80.03 percent. Additionally, we address real-world deployment challenges through model calibration to reduce overconfidence and optimization for mobile devices. The proposed system provides a scalable and practical tool for early-stage diabetic retinopathy screening.",

    "title": "Directed Ordinal Diffusion Regularization for Progression-Aware Diabetic Retinopathy Grading",
    "abstract": "Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) progresses as a continuous and irreversible deterioration of the retina, following a well-defined clinical trajectory from mild to severe stages. However, most existing ordinal regression approaches model DR severity as a set of static, symmetric ranks, capturing relative order while ignoring the inherent unidirectional nature of disease progression. As a result, the learned feature representations may violate biological plausibility, allowing implausible proximity between non-consecutive stages or even reverse transitions. To bridge this gap, we propose Directed Ordinal Diffusion Regularization (D-ODR), which explicitly models the feature space as a directed flow by constructing a progression-constrained directed graph that strictly enforces forward disease evolution. By performing multi-scale diffusion on this directed structure, D-ODR imposes penalties on score inversions along valid progression paths, thereby effectively preventing the model from learning biologically inconsistent reverse transitions. This mechanism aligns the feature representation with the natural trajectory of DR worsening. Extensive experiments demonstrate that D-ODR yields superior grading performance compared to state-of-the-art ordinal regression and DR-specific grading methods, offering a more clinically reliable assessment of disease severity.

This paper proposes that a list experiment, a simple method widely used in the social sciences, can be applied to study the hidden beliefs of LLMs. List experiments were originally developed to circumvent social desirability bias in human respondents, which closely parallels alignment faking in LLMs. The paper implements a list experiment on models developed by Anthropic, Google, and OpenAI and finds hidden approval of mass surveillance across all models, as well as some approval of torture, discrimination, and first nuclear strike. Importantly, a placebo treatment produces a null result, validating the method. The paper then compares list experiments with direct questioning and discusses the utility of the approach.",

While AI and machine learning models improve risk stratification, their adoption is hindered by a lack of transparency, as they are often perceived as \\textit{black boxes} with unclear decision-making processes. Some approaches apply heuristic explanations without correctness guarantees, leading to mistakes in the decision-making process. To address this, we apply a logic-based explainability method with correctness guarantees to the problem of SCD prediction in CC. This explainability method, applied to an AI classifier with over 95\\% accuracy and recall, demonstrated strong predictive performance and 100\\% explanation fidelity. When compared to state-of-the-art heuristic methods, it showed superior consistency and robustness.

At its core is CARD-ViT, a self-supervised Vision Transformer trained exclusively on gated CT data using DINO. Without any non-gated training data, our framework achieves 0.707 accuracy and a Cohen's kappa of 0.528 on the Stanford non-gated dataset, matching models trained directly on non-gated scans. On gated test sets, the framework achieves 0.910 accuracy with Cohen's kappa scores of 0.871 and 0.874 across independent datasets, demonstrating robust risk stratification.

Necessary and sufficient conditions for valid parity assignments are established in terms of distance constraints between codewords and their nearest non-codewords. It is shown that the Hamming-distance-3 relations among Hamming codewords induce a bipartite graph, a fundamental geometric property that is exploited to develop a systematic SEFCC construction. By deriving a tight upper bound on the sum of pairwise distances, we prove that the proposed bipartite construction uniquely achieves the maximum sum-distance, the largest possible minimum distance of 2, and the minimum number of distance-2 codeword pairs. Consequently, for the HCMF SEFCC problem, sum-distance maximisation is not merely heuristic-it exactly enforces the optimal distance-spectrum properties relevant to error probability. Simulation results over AWGN channels with soft-decision decoding confirm that the resulting max-sum SEFCCs provide significantly improved data protection and Bit Error Rate (BER) performance compared to arbitrary valid assignments.",

    "abstract": "Scene-consistent video generation aims to create videos that explore 3D scenes based on a camera trajectory. Previous methods rely on video generation models with external memory for consistency, or iterative 3D reconstruction and inpainting, which accumulate errors during inference due to incorrect intermediary outputs, non-differentiable processes, and separate models. To overcome these limitations, we introduce ``geometry-as-context\". It iteratively completes the following steps using an autoregressive camera-controlled video generation model: (1) estimates the geometry of the current view necessary for 3D reconstruction, and (2) simulates and restores novel view images rendered by the 3D scene. Under this multi-task framework, we develop the camera gated attention module to enhance the model's capability to effectively leverage camera poses. During the training phase, text contexts are utilized to ascertain whether geometric or RGB images should be generated. To ensure that the model can generate RGB-only outputs during inference, the geometry context is randomly dropped from the interleaved text-image-geometry training sequence. The method has been tested on scene video generation with one-direction and forth-and-back trajectories. The results show its superiority over previous approaches in maintaining scene consistency and camera control.",

    "abstract": "Root cause analysis (RCA) in networked industrial systems, such as supply chains and power networks, is notoriously difficult due to unknown and dynamically evolving interdependencies among geographically distributed clients. These clients represent heterogeneous physical processes and industrial assets equipped with sensors that generate large volumes of nonlinear, high-dimensional, and heterogeneous IoT data. Classical RCA methods require partial or full knowledge of the system's dependency graph, which is rarely available in these complex networks. While federated learning (FL) offers a natural framework for decentralized settings, most existing FL methods assume homogeneous feature spaces and retrainable client models. These assumptions are not compatible with our problem setting. Different clients have different data features and often run fixed, proprietary models that cannot be modified. This paper presents a federated cross-client interdependency learning methodology for feature-partitioned, nonlinear time-series data, without requiring access to raw sensor streams or modifying proprietary client models. Each proprietary local client model is augmented with a Machine Learning (ML) model that encodes cross-client interdependencies. These ML models are coordinated via a global server that enforces representation consistency while preserving privacy through calibrated differential privacy noise. RCA is performed using model residuals and anomaly flags. We establish theoretical convergence guarantees and validate our approach on extensive simulations and a real-world industrial cybersecurity dataset.",

Using the AMiner citation dataset, we analyze 113,637 early-career researchers and identify 1,425 comeback cases based on a three-year-or-longer publication gap followed by renewed activity. We find that comeback researchers cite 126% more distinct communities and exhibit 7.6% higher bridging scores compared to dropouts. They also demonstrate 74% higher gap entropy, reflecting more irregular yet strategically impactful publication trajectories. Predictive models trained on these bridging- and entropy-based features achieve a 97% ROC-AUC, far outperforming the 54% ROC-AUC of baseline models using traditional metrics like publication count and h-index. Finally, we substantiate these results via a multi-lens validation. These findings highlight the unique contributions of comeback researchers and offer data-driven tools for their early identification and institutional support.",

    "abstract": "Alleviating catastrophic forgetting while enabling further learning is a primary challenge in continual learning (CL). Orthogonal-based training methods have gained attention for their efficiency and strong theoretical properties, and many existing approaches enforce orthogonality through gradient projection. In this paper, we revisit orthogonality and exploit the fact that small singular values correspond to directions that are nearly orthogonal to the input space of previous tasks. Building on this principle, we introduce NESS (Null-space Estimated from Small Singular values), a CL method that applies orthogonality directly in the weight space rather than through gradient manipulation. Specifically, NESS constructs an approximate null space using the smallest singular values of each layer's input representation and parameterizes task-specific updates via a compact low-rank adaptation (LoRA-style) formulation constrained to this subspace. The subspace basis is fixed to preserve the null-space constraint, and only a single trainable matrix is learned for each task. This design ensures that the resulting updates remain approximately in the null space of previous inputs while enabling adaptation to new tasks. Our theoretical analysis and experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate competitive performance, low forgetting, and stable accuracy across tasks, highlighting the role of small singular values in continual learning.

    "abstract": "Lossless compression is essential for efficient data storage and transmission. Although learning-based lossless compressors achieve strong results, most of them are designed for a single modality, leading to redundant compressor deployments in multi-modal settings. Designing a unified multi-modal compressor is critical yet challenging, as different data types vary largely in format, dimension, and statistics. Multi-modal large language models offer a promising resolution but remain too complex for practical use. Thus, we propose \\textbf{OmniZip}, \\textbf{a unified and lightweight lossless compressor for multi-modal data (like image, text, speech, tactile, database, and gene sequence)}. Built on a lightweight backbone, OmniZip incorporates three key components to enable efficient multi-modal lossless compression: a modality-unified tokenizer that reversibly transforms diverse data into tokens, a modality-routing context learning mechanism that enables flexible multi-modal context modeling, and a modality-routing feedforward design that further enhances the model's nonlinear representation flexibility. A reparameterization training strategy is used to enhance model capacity. OmniZip outperforms or matches other state-of-the-art compressors on multiple modalities, achieving 42\\%, 57\\%, 62\\% and 42\\%, 53\\% higher compression efficiency than gzip on CLIC-M, TouchandGo, enwik9, LibriSpeech, and WikiSQL datasets, respectively.

While state space models (SSMs) like Mamba promise linear complexity, their pixel-serial scanning remains a fundamental bottleneck for the millions of pixels in UHD content. We ask: must we process every pixel to understand the image? This paper introduces C$^2$SSM, a visual state space model that breaks this taboo by shifting from pixel-serial to cluster-serial scanning. Our core discovery is that the rich feature distribution of a UHD image can be distilled into a sparse set of semantic centroids via a neural-parameterized mixture model. C$^2$SSM leverages this to reformulate global modeling into a novel dual-path process: it scans and reasons over a handful of cluster centers, then diffuses the global context back to all pixels through a principled similarity distribution, all while a lightweight modulator preserves fine details. This cluster-centric paradigm achieves a decisive leap in efficiency, slashing computational costs while establishing new state-of-the-art results across five UHD restoration tasks. More than a solution, C$^2$SSM charts a new course for efficient large-scale vision: scan clusters, not pixels.",

    "abstract": "We present a geometry-aware method for heterogeneous single-particle cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) reconstruction that predicts atomic backbone conformations. To incorporate protein-structure priors, we represent the backbone as a graph and use a graph neural network (GNN) autodecoder that maps per-image latent variables to 3D displacements of a template conformation. The objective combines a data-discrepancy term based on a differentiable cryo-EM forward model with geometric regularization, and it supports unknown orientations via ellipsoidal support lifting (ESL) pose estimation. On synthetic datasets derived from molecular dynamics trajectories, the proposed GNN achieves higher accuracy compared to a multilayer perceptron (MLP) of comparable size, highlighting the benefits of a geometry-informed inductive bias.",

    "title": "The Error of Deep Operator Networks Is the Sum of Its Parts: Branch-Trunk and Mode Error Decompositions",
    "abstract": "Operator learning has the potential to strongly impact scientific computing by learning solution operators for differential equations, potentially accelerating multi-query tasks such as design optimization and uncertainty quantification by orders of magnitude. Despite proven universal approximation properties, deep operator networks (DeepONets) often exhibit limited accuracy and generalization in practice, which hinders their adoption. Understanding these limitations is therefore crucial for further advancing the approach.   This work analyzes performance limitations of the classical DeepONet architecture. It is shown that the approximation error is dominated by the branch network when the internal dimension is sufficiently large, and that the learned trunk basis can often be replaced by classical basis functions without a significant impact on performance.   To investigate this further, a modified DeepONet is constructed in which the trunk network is replaced by the left singular vectors of the training solution matrix. This modification yields several key insights. First, a spectral bias in the branch network is observed, with coefficients of dominant, low-frequency modes learned more effectively. Second, due to singular-value scaling of the branch coefficients, the overall branch error is dominated by modes with intermediate singular values rather than the smallest ones. Third, using a shared branch network for all mode coefficients, as in the standard architecture, improves generalization of small modes compared to a stacked architecture in which coefficients are computed separately. Finally, strong and detrimental coupling between modes in parameter space is identified.",

    "abstract": "Clouds are a major obstacle in Earth observation, limiting the usability and reliability of critical remote sensing applications such as fire disaster response, urban heat island monitoring, and snow and ice cover mapping. Therefore, the ability to detect clouds 24/7 is of paramount importance. While visible and near-infrared bands are effective for daytime cloud detection, their dependence on solar illumination makes them unsuitable for nighttime monitoring. In contrast, thermal infrared (TIR) imagery plays a crucial role in detecting clouds at night, when sunlight is absent. Due to their generally lower temperatures, clouds emit distinct thermal signatures that are detectable in TIR bands. Despite this, accurate nighttime cloud detection remains challenging due to limited spectral information and the typically lower spatial resolution of TIR imagery. To address these challenges, we present TIRAuxCloud, a multi-modal dataset centered around thermal spectral data to facilitate cloud segmentation under both daytime and nighttime conditions. The dataset comprises a unique combination of multispectral data (TIR, optical, and near-infrared bands) from Landsat and VIIRS, aligned with auxiliary information layers. Elevation, land cover, meteorological variables, and cloud-free reference images are included to help reduce surface-cloud ambiguity and cloud formation uncertainty. To overcome the scarcity of manual cloud labels, we include a large set of samples with automated cloud masks and a smaller manually annotated subset to further evaluate and improve models. Comprehensive benchmarks are presented to establish performance baselines through supervised and transfer learning, demonstrating the dataset's value in advancing the development of innovative methods for day and night time cloud detection.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of Omni-Modal Large Language Models~(Omni-LLMs) has revolutionized human--computer interaction, enabling unified audio-visual perception and speech response. However, existing Omni-LLMs struggle with complex real-world scenarios, often leading to superficial understanding and contextually mismatched emotional responses. This issue is further intensified by Omni-LLM's Thinker-Talker architectures, which are implicitly connected through hidden states, leading to the loss of emotional details. In this work, we present EmoOmni, a unified framework for accurate understanding and expression in multimodal emotional dialogue. At its core, we introduce the emotional Chain-of-Thought~(E-CoT), which enforces a reasoning from fine-grained multimodal perception to textual response. Moreover, we explicitly treat E-CoT as high-level emotional instructions that guide the talker, enabling accurate emotional expression. Complementing the model, we construct EmoOmniPipe to obtain the real-world annotated dialogue data and establish a benchmark, EmoOmniEval, to facilitate systematic assessment of multimodal emotional dialogue task. Experiments show that EmoOmni-7B achieves comparable performance with Qwen3Omni-30B-A3B-Thinking under the same talker.",

    "abstract": "Objective: The objective of this study is to develop a machine learning (ML)-based framework for early risk stratification of clinical trials (CTs) according to their likelihood of exhibiting a high rate of dosing errors, using information available prior to trial initiation. Materials and Methods: We constructed a dataset from ClinicalTrials.gov comprising 42,112 CTs. Structured, semi-structured trial data, and unstructured protocol-related free-text data were extracted. CTs were assigned binary labels indicating elevated dosing error rate, derived from adverse event reports, MedDRA terminology, and Wilson confidence intervals. We evaluated an XGBoost model trained on structured features, a ClinicalModernBERT model using textual data, and a simple late-fusion model combining both modalities. Post-hoc probability calibration was applied to enable interpretable, trial-level risk stratification. Results: The late-fusion model achieved the highest AUC-ROC (0.862). Beyond discrimination, calibrated outputs enabled robust stratification of CTs into predefined risk categories. The proportion of trials labeled as having an excessively high dosing error rate increased monotonically across higher predicted risk groups and aligned with the corresponding predicted probability ranges. Discussion: These findings indicate that dosing error risk can be anticipated at the trial level using pre-initiation information. Probability calibration was essential for translating model outputs into reliable and interpretable risk categories, while simple multimodal integration yielded performance gains without requiring complex architectures. Conclusion: This study introduces a reproducible and scalable ML framework for early, trial-level risk stratification of CTs at risk of high dosing error rates, supporting proactive, risk-based quality management in clinical research.",

    "abstract": "Cellular-enabled collaborative robots are becoming paramount in Search-and-Rescue (SAR) and emergency response. Crucially dependent on resilient mobile network connectivity, they serve as invaluable assets for tasks like rapid victim localization and the exploration of hazardous, otherwise unreachable areas. However, their reliance on battery power and the need for persistent, low-latency communication limit operational time and mobility. To address this, and considering the evolving capabilities of 5G/6G networks, we propose a novel SAR framework that includes Mission Planning and Mission Execution phases and that optimizes robot deployment. By considering parameters such as the exploration area size, terrain elevation, robot fleet size, communication-influenced energy profiles, desired exploration rate, and target response time, our framework determines the minimum number of robots required and their optimal paths to ensure effective coverage and timely data backhaul over mobile networks. Our results demonstrate the trade-offs between number of robots, explored area, and response time for wheeled and quadruped robots. Further, we quantify the impact of terrain elevation data on mission time and energy consumption, showing the benefits of incorporating real-world environmental factors that might also affect mobile signal propagation and connectivity into SAR planning. This framework provides critical insights for leveraging next-generation mobile networks to enhance autonomous SAR operations.",

    "abstract": "Heterogeneous nodes that combine multi-core CPUs with diverse accelerators are rapidly becoming the norm in both high-performance computing (HPC) and AI infrastructures. Exploiting these platforms, however, requires orchestrating several low-level accelerator APIs such as CUDA, SYCL, and Triton. In some occasions they can be combined with optimized vendor math libraries: e.g., cuBLAS and oneAPI. Each API or library introduces its own abstractions, execution semantics, and synchronization mechanisms. Combining them within a single application is therefore error-prone and labor-intensive. We propose reusing a task-based data-flow methodology together with Task-Aware APIs (TA-libs) to overcome these limitations and facilitate the seamless integration of multiple accelerator programming models, while still leveraging the best-in-class kernels offered by each API.   Applications are expressed as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of host tasks and device kernels managed by an OpenMP/OmpSs-2 runtime. We introduce Task-Aware SYCL (TASYCL) and leverage Task-Aware CUDA (TACUDA), which elevate individual accelerator invocations to first-class tasks. When multiple native runtimes coexist on the same multi-core CPU, they contend for threads, leading to oversubscription and performance variability. To address this, we unify their thread management under the nOS-V tasking and threading library, to which we contribute a new port of the PoCL (Portable OpenCL) runtime.   These results demonstrate that task-aware libraries, coupled with the nOS-V library, enable a single application to harness multiple accelerator programming models transparently and efficiently. The proposed methodology is immediately applicable to current heterogeneous nodes and is readily extensible to future systems that integrate even richer combinations of CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, and AI accelerators.",

Because the sequence is generated by a periodic iteration of morphisms rather than a single primitive substitution, classical Perron--Frobenius methods do not directly apply to determine symbol frequencies. We prove that both symbols ${\\tt 0},{\\tt 1}$ occur with frequency $1/2$ and we show uniform recurrence and symmetry properties of its set of factors. The proof reveals a structural bridge between combinatorics on words and harmonic analysis: the first difference sequence is shown to be Toeplitz, providing dynamical rigidity, while filtered frequencies naturally encode a dyadic structure that lifts to the compact group of $2$-adic integers. In this $2$-adic setting, desubstitution becomes a linear operator on Fourier coefficients, and a spectral contraction argument enforces uniqueness of limiting densities. Our results answer several conjectures of Dekking (on a sibling sequence) and illustrate how harmonic analysis on compact groups can be fruitfully combined with substitution dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Accurate depth estimation plays a critical role in the navigation of endoscopic surgical robots, forming the foundation for 3D reconstruction and safe instrument guidance. Fine-tuning pretrained models heavily relies on endoscopic surgical datasets with precise depth annotations. While existing self-supervised depth estimation techniques eliminate the need for accurate depth annotations, their performance degrades in environments with weak textures and variable lighting, leading to sparse reconstruction with invalid depth estimation. Depth completion using sparse depth maps can mitigate these issues and improve accuracy. Despite the advances in depth completion techniques in general fields, their application in endoscopy remains limited. To overcome these limitations, we propose EndoDDC, an endoscopy depth completion method that integrates images, sparse depth information with depth gradient features, and optimizes depth maps through a diffusion model, addressing the issues of weak texture and light reflection in endoscopic environments. Extensive experiments on two publicly available endoscopy datasets show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art models in both depth accuracy and robustness. This demonstrates the potential of our method to reduce visual errors in complex endoscopic environments. Our code will be released at https://github.com/yinheng-lin/EndoDDC.",

On the other hand, APFuzz introduces field-level mutation operations for binary protocols, leveraging message structure awareness enabled by Large Language Models.

Our framework uses Bayesian methods for causal inference to model 1) how a prediction on a new observation affects the beliefs of a rational Bayesian agent, and 2) how this change in beliefs affects the downstream decision and subsequent outcome. Using this framework, we show by simulations how a single misaligned prior belief can be sufficient for decision support to result in worse downstream outcomes compared to no decision support.

In this paper, we propose ExpLang, a novel LLM post-training pipeline that enables on-policy thinking language selection to improve exploration and exploitation during RL with the use of multiple languages. The results show that our method steadily outperforms English-only training with the same training budget, while showing high thinking language compliance for both seen and unseen languages. Analysis shows that, by enabling on-policy thinking language selection as an action during RL, ExpLang effectively extends the RL exploration space with diversified language preference and improves the RL exploitation outcome with leveraged non-English advantage. The method is orthogonal to most RL algorithms and opens up a new perspective on using multilinguality to improve LRMs.",

Yet, none of these paradigms supports users at capture time, when the crucial question is how to improve a photo memorability. We introduce the task of Memorability Feedback (MemFeed), where an automated model should provide actionable, human-interpretable guidance to users with the goal to enhance an image future recall. We also present MemCoach, the first approach designed to provide concrete suggestions in natural language for memorability improvement (e.g., \"emphasize facial expression,\" \"bring the subject forward\"). Our method, based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), is training-free and employs a teacher-student steering strategy, aligning the model internal activations toward more memorable patterns learned from a teacher model progressing along least-to-most memorable samples. To enable systematic evaluation on this novel task, we further introduce MemBench, a new benchmark featuring sequence-aligned photoshoots with annotated memorability scores. Our experiments, considering multiple MLLMs, demonstrate the effectiveness of MemCoach, showing consistently improved performance over several zero-shot models. The results indicate that memorability can not only be predicted but also taught and instructed, shifting the focus from mere prediction to actionable feedback for human creators.",

    "abstract": "A user-centered AR interface for disaster response is presented in this work that uses 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to visualize detailed scene reconstructions, while maintaining situational awareness and keeping cognitive load low. The interface relies on a lightweight interaction approach, combining World-in-Miniature (WIM) navigation with semantic Points of Interest (POIs) that can be filtered as needed, and it is supported by an architecture designed to stream updates as reconstructions evolve. User feedback from a preliminary evaluation indicates that this design is easy to use and supports real-time coordination, with participants highlighting the value of interaction and POIs for fast decision-making in context. Thorough user-centric performance evaluation demonstrates strong usability of the developed interface and high acceptance ratios.",

    "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) facilitates the secure utilization of decentralized images, advancing applications in medical image recognition and autonomous driving. However, conventional FL faces two critical challenges in real-world deployment: ineffective knowledge fusion caused by model updates biased toward majority-class features, and prohibitive communication overhead due to frequent transmissions of high-dimensional model parameters. Inspired by the human brain's efficiency in knowledge integration, we propose a novel Generative Federated Prototype Learning (GFPL) framework to address these issues. Within this framework, a prototype generation method based on Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) captures the statistical information of class-wise features, while a prototype aggregation strategy using Bhattacharyya distance effectively fuses semantically similar knowledge across clients. In addition, these fused prototypes are leveraged to generate pseudo-features, thereby mitigating feature distribution imbalance across clients. To further enhance feature alignment during local training, we devise a dual-classifier architecture, optimized via a hybrid loss combining Dot Regression and Cross-Entropy. Extensive experiments on benchmarks show that GFPL improves model accuracy by 3.6% under imbalanced data settings while maintaining low communication cost.",

    "abstract": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as versatile solutions for zero-shot question answering (QA) across various domains. However, enabling VLMs to effectively comprehend structured graphs and perform accurate, efficient QA remains challenging. Existing approaches typically rely on one single graph topology representation (GTR), such as fixed-style visual images or unified text descriptions. This ``one-size-fits-all'' strategy often neglects model-specific and task-specific preferences, resulting in inaccurate or over-lengthy responses to graph-related queries. To address this, we propose the $\\mbox{DynamicGTR}$ framework, which dynamically selects the optimal GTR for each query during inference, thereby enhancing the zero-shot graph QA capabilities of VLMs with a customizable accuracy and brevity trade-off. Extensive experiments show that DynamicGTR not only improves VLM-based graph algorithm QA performance but also successfully transfers the experience trained from synthetic graph algorithm tasks to real-world applications like link prediction and node classification, without any additional training. Additionally, DynamicGTR demonstrates strong transferability across tasks, domains, and models, suggesting its potential as a flexible solution for broad graph scenarios.",

To address these limitations, we propose BrepCoder, a unifi ed Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) that performs diverse CAD tasks from B-rep inputs. By leveraging the code generation capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we convert CAD modeling sequences into Python-like code and align them with B-rep. We then adopt a two-stage training strategy: First, pre-training on reverse engineering to learn geometric features and design logic. Second, eff ectively extending the model to various downstream tasks such as completion, error correction, and CAD-QA. Consequently, by interpreting B-rep as structural code, BrepCoder achieves superior generalization across diverse tasks, demonstrating its potential as a general-purpose CAD agent.",

    "abstract": "Since individuals may struggle to recall all life details and often confuse events, establishing a system to assist users in recalling forgotten experiences is essential. While numerous studies have proposed memory recall systems, these primarily rely on deep learning techniques that require extensive training and often face data scarcity due to the limited availability of personal lifelogs. As lifelogs grow over time, systems must also adapt quickly to newly accumulated data. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various tasks, making them promising for personalized applications. In this work, we present a framework that leverages LLMs for proactive information access, integrating personal knowledge graphs to enhance the detection of access needs through a refined decision-making process. Our framework offers high flexibility, enabling the replacement of base models and the modification of fact retrieval methods for continuous improvement. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach effectively identifies forgotten events, supporting users in recalling past experiences more efficiently.",

    "abstract": "Our main result is a full classification, for every connected graph $H$, of the computational complexity of Steiner Forest on $H$-subgraph-free graphs. To obtain this dichotomy, we establish the following new algorithmic, hardness, and combinatorial results:   Algorithms: We identify two new classes of graph-theoretical structures that make it possible to solve Steiner Forest in polynomial time. Roughly speaking, our algorithms handle the following cases: (1) a set $X$ of vertices of bounded size that are pairwise connected by subgraphs of treewidth $2$ or bounded size, possibly together with an independent set of arbitrary size that is connected to $X$ in an arbitrary way; (2) a set $X$ of vertices of arbitrary size that are pairwise connected in a cyclic manner by subgraphs of treewidth $2$ or bounded size.   Hardness results: We show that Steiner Forest remains NP-complete for graphs with 2-deletion set number $3$. (The $c$-deletion set number is the size of a smallest cutset $S$ such that every component of $G-S$ has at most $c$ vertices.)   Combinatorial results: To establish the dichotomy, we perform a delicate graph-theoretic analysis showing that if $H$ is a path or a subdivided claw, then excluding $H$ as a subgraph either yields one of the two algorithmically favourable structures described above, or yields a graph class for which NP-completeness of Steiner Forest follows from either our new hardness result or a previously known one.   Along the way to classifying the hardness for excluded subgraphs, we establish a dichotomy for graphs with $c$-deletion set number at most $k$. Specifically, our results together with pre-existing ones show that Steiner Forest is polynomial-time solvable if (1) $c=1$ and $k\\geq 0$, or (2) $c=2$ and $k\\leq 2$, or (3) $c\\geq 3$ and $k=1$, and is NP-complete otherwise.",

    "abstract": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in mobile agent development, yet their capabilities are predominantly confined to a reactive paradigm, where they merely execute explicit user commands. The emerging paradigm of proactive intelligence, where agents autonomously anticipate needs and initiate actions, represents the next frontier for mobile agents. However, its development is critically bottlenecked by the lack of benchmarks that can address real-world complexity and enable objective, executable evaluation. To overcome these challenges, we introduce ProactiveMobile, a comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically advance research in this domain. ProactiveMobile formalizes the proactive task as inferring latent user intent across four dimensions of on-device contextual signals and generating an executable function sequence from a comprehensive function pool of 63 APIs. The benchmark features over 3,660 instances of 14 scenarios that embrace real-world complexity through multi-answer annotations. To ensure quality, a team of 30 experts conducts a final audit of the benchmark, verifying factual accuracy, logical consistency, and action feasibility, and correcting any non-compliant entries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our fine-tuned Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct achieves a success rate of 19.15%, outperforming o1 (15.71%) and GPT-5 (7.39%). This result indicates that proactivity is a critical competency widely lacking in current MLLMs, yet it is learnable, emphasizing the importance of the proposed benchmark for proactivity evaluation.",

Semi-automatic tools like Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) can ease this process by propagating annotations across frames, but small errors often accumulate and reduce accuracy, requiring expert review and correction. To address this, we systematically study how annotation errors propagate across different prompt types, namely masks, boxes, and points, and propose Learning-to-Re-Prompt (L2RP), a cost-aware framework that learns when and where to seek expert input. By tuning a human-cost parameter, our method balances annotation effort and segmentation accuracy. Experiments on a private Barrett's dysplasia dataset and the public SUN-SEG benchmark demonstrate improved temporal consistency and superior performance over baseline strategies.",

In this paper, we introduce FewMMBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs under few-shot conditions, with a focus on In-Context Learning (ICL) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting. Covering a diverse suite of multimodal understanding tasks, from attribute recognition to temporal reasoning, FewMMBench enables systematic analysis across task types, model families, and prompting strategies. We evaluate 26 open-weight MLLMs from six model families across zero-shot, few-shot, and CoT-augmented few-shot settings. Our findings reveal that instruction-tuned models exhibit strong zero-shot performance but benefit minimally, or even regress, with additional demonstrations or CoT reasoning. Retrieval-based demonstrations and increased context size also yield limited gains. These results highlight FewMMBench as a rigorous testbed for diagnosing and advancing few-shot capabilities in multimodal LLMs. The data is available at: https://huggingface.co/datasets/mustafaa/FewMMBench",

    "title": "Meta-FC: Meta-Learning with Feature Consistency for Robust and Generalizable Watermarking",
    "abstract": "Deep learning-based watermarking has made remarkable progress in recent years. To achieve robustness against various distortions, current methods commonly adopt a training strategy where a \\underline{\\textbf{s}}ingle \\underline{\\textbf{r}}andom \\underline{\\textbf{d}}istortion (SRD) is chosen as the noise layer in each training batch. However, the SRD strategy treats distortions independently within each batch, neglecting the inherent relationships among different types of distortions and causing optimization conflicts across batches. As a result, the robustness and generalizability of the watermarking model are limited. To address this issue, we propose a novel training strategy that enhances robustness and generalization via \\underline{\\textbf{meta}}-learning with \\underline{\\textbf{f}}eature \\underline{\\textbf{c}}onsistency (Meta-FC). Specifically, we randomly sample multiple distortions from the noise pool to construct a meta-training task, while holding out one distortion as a simulated ``unknown'' distortion for the meta-testing phase. Through meta-learning, the model is encouraged to identify and utilize neurons that exhibit stable activations across different types of distortions, mitigating the optimization conflicts caused by the random sampling of diverse distortions in each batch. To further promote the transformation of stable activations into distortion-invariant representations, we introduce a feature consistency loss that constrains the decoded features of the same image subjected to different distortions to remain consistent. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared to the SRD training strategy, Meta-FC improves the robustness and generalization of various watermarking models by an average of 1.59\\%, 4.71\\%, and 2.38\\% under high-intensity, combined, and unknown distortions.",

    "abstract": "Representing, comparing, and measuring the distance between probability distributions is a key task in computational statistics and machine learning. The choice of representation and the associated distance determine properties of the methods in which they are used: for example, certain distances can allow one to encode robustness or smoothness of the problem. Kernel methods offer flexible and rich Hilbert space representations of distributions that allow the modeller to enforce properties through the choice of kernel, and estimate associated distances at efficient nonparametric rates. In particular, the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), a kernel-based distance constructed by comparing Hilbert space mean functions, has received significant attention due to its computational tractability and is favoured by practitioners.   In this thesis, we conduct a thorough study of kernel-based distances with a focus on efficient computation, with core contributions in Chapters 3 to 6. Part I of the thesis is focused on the MMD, specifically on improved MMD estimation. In Chapter 3 we propose a theoretically sound, improved estimator for MMD in simulation-based inference. Then, in Chapter 4, we propose an MMD-based estimator for conditional expectations, a ubiquitous task in statistical computation. Closing Part I, in Chapter 5 we study the problem of calibration when MMD is applied to the task of integration.   In Part II, motivated by the recent developments in kernel embeddings beyond the mean, we introduce a family of novel kernel-based discrepancies: kernel quantile discrepancies. These address some of the pitfalls of MMD, and are shown through both theoretical results and an empirical study to offer a competitive alternative to MMD and its fast approximations. We conclude with a discussion on broader lessons and future work emerging from the thesis.",

This work introduces an open-source Python library xai-cola, which provides an end-to-end pipeline for sparsifying CEs produced by arbitrary generators, reducing superfluous feature changes while preserving their validity. It offers a documented API that takes as input raw tabular data in pandas DataFrame form, a preprocessing object (for standardization and encoding), and a trained scikit-learn or PyTorch model. On this basis, users can either employ the built-in or externally imported CE generators. The library also implements several sparsification policies and includes visualization routines for analysing and comparing sparsified counterfactuals. xai-cola is released under the MIT license and can be installed from PyPI. Empirical experiments indicate that xai-cola produces sparser counterfactuals across several CE generators, reducing the number of modified features by up to 50% in our setting.

    "abstract": "Differentially private federated learning faces a fundamental tension: privacy protection mechanisms that safeguard client data simultaneously create quantifiable privacy costs that discourage participation, undermining the collaborative training process. Existing incentive mechanisms rely on unbiased client selection, forcing servers to compensate even the most privacy-sensitive clients (\"privacy stragglers\"), leading to systemic inefficiency and suboptimal resource allocation. We introduce JSAM (Joint client Selection and privacy compensAtion Mechanism), a Bayesian-optimal framework that simultaneously optimizes client selection probabilities and privacy compensation to maximize training effectiveness under budget constraints. Our approach transforms a complex 2N-dimensional optimization problem into an efficient three-dimensional formulation through novel theoretical characterization of optimal selection strategies. We prove that servers should preferentially select privacy-tolerant clients while excluding high-sensitivity participants, and uncover the counter-intuitive insight that clients with minimal privacy sensitivity may incur the highest cumulative costs due to frequent participation. Extensive evaluations on MNIST and CIFAR-10 demonstrate that JSAM achieves up to 15% improvement in test accuracy compared to existing unbiased selection mechanisms while maintaining cost efficiency across varying data heterogeneity levels.",

    "title": "Differentially Private Truncation of Unbounded Data via Public Second Moments",
    "abstract": "Data privacy is important in the AI era, and differential privacy (DP) is one of the golden solutions. However, DP is typically applicable only if data have a bounded underlying distribution. We address this limitation by leveraging second-moment information from a small amount of public data. We propose Public-moment-guided Truncation (PMT), which transforms private data using the public second-moment matrix and applies a principled truncation whose radius depends only on non-private quantities: data dimension and sample size. This transformation yields a well-conditioned second-moment matrix, enabling its inversion with a significantly strengthened ability to resist the DP noise. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability of PMT by using penalized and generalized linear regressions. Specifically, we design new loss functions and algorithms, ensuring that solutions in the transformed space can be mapped back to the original domain. We have established improvements in the models' DP estimation through theoretical error bounds, robustness guarantees, and convergence results, attributing the gains to the conditioning effect of PMT. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets confirm that PMT substantially improves the accuracy and stability of DP models.",

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a key paradigm for building Trustworthy AI systems by enabling privacy-preserving, decentralized model training. However, FL is highly susceptible to adversarial attacks that compromise model integrity and data confidentiality, a vulnerability exacerbated by the fact that conventional data inspection methods are incompatible with its decentralized design. While integrating FL with Blockchain technology has been proposed to address some limitations, its potential for mitigating adversarial attacks remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces Resilient Federated Chain (RFC), a novel blockchain-enabled FL framework designed specifically to enhance resilience against such threats. RFC builds upon the existing Proof of Federated Learning architecture by repurposing the redundancy of its Pooled Mining mechanism as an active defense layer that can be combined with robust aggregation rules. Furthermore, the framework introduces a flexible evaluation function in its consensus mechanism, allowing for adaptive defense against different attack strategies. Extensive experimental evaluation on image classification tasks under various adversarial scenarios, demonstrates that RFC significantly improves robustness compared to baseline methods, providing a viable solution for securing decentralized learning environments.",

    "abstract": "Video foundation models aim to integrate video understanding, generation, editing, and instruction following within a single framework, making them a central direction for next-generation multimodal systems. However, existing evaluation benchmarks remain fragmented and limited in scope, as they each target a single task, rely on task-specific metrics, and typically use short or simple video clips. As a result, they do not capture the unified capabilities that these models are designed to deliver. To address this gap, we introduce UniVBench, a benchmark purpose-built for evaluating video foundation models across four core abilities: video understanding, video generation, video editing, and a newly proposed task, video reconstruction, which assesses how faithfully a model can reproduce video content it has encountered. Our benchmark substantially expands the complexity of evaluation by incorporating 200 high-quality, diverse and multi-shot videos, each paired with detailed captions, multi-format editing instructions, and reference images. All videos are human-created and carefully validated, offering richer cinematic information than prior benchmarks. In addition, we develop a unified agentic evaluation system (UniV-Eval) that standardizes prompting, instruction parsing, and scoring across all tasks, enabling fair, scalable, and reproducible comparisons of unified video models. By grounding evaluation in instruction-based multi-shot video tasks, UniVBench provides the first framework for measuring the integrated capabilities that video foundation models aim to achieve. Extensive human annotations ensure our evaluation aligns with human judgment, enabling rigorous assessment and accelerating progress toward robust video intelligence.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for automated code refactoring tasks. Although these models can quickly refactor code, the quality may exhibit inconsistencies and unpredictable behavior. In this article, we systematically study the capabilities of LLMs for code refactoring with a specific focus on improving code readability.   We conducted a large-scale experiment using GPT5.1 with 230 Java snippets, each systematically varied and refactored regarding code readability across five iterations under three different prompting strategies. We categorized fine-grained code changes during the refactoring into implementation, syntactic, and comment-level transformations. Subsequently, we investigated the functional correctness and tested the robustness of the results with novel snippets.   Our results reveal three main insights: First, iterative code refactoring exhibits an initial phase of restructuring followed by stabilization. This convergence tendency suggests that LLMs possess an internalized understanding of an \"optimally readable\" version of code. Second, convergence patterns are fairly robust across different code variants. Third, explicit prompting toward specific readability factors slightly influences the refactoring dynamics.   These insights provide an empirical foundation for assessing the reliability of LLM-assisted code refactoring, which opens pathways for future research, including comparative analyses across models and a systematic evaluation of additional software quality dimensions in LLM-refactored code.",

    "abstract": "AI is increasingly being used to assist fraud and cybercrime. However, it is unclear whether current large language models can assist complex criminal activity. Working with law enforcement and policy experts, we developed multi-turn evaluations for three fraud and cybercrime scenarios (romance scams, CEO impersonation, and identity theft). Our evaluations focused on text-to-text model capabilities. In each scenario, we measured model capabilities in ways designed to resemble real-world misuse, such as breaking down requests for fraud into a sequence of seemingly benign queries, and measuring whether models provide actionable information, relative to a standard web search baseline.   We found that (1) current large language models provide minimal practical assistance with complex criminal activity, (2) open-weight large language models fine-tuned to remove safety guardrails provided substantially more help, and (3) decomposing requests into benign-seeming queries elicited more assistance than explicitly malicious framing or system-level jailbreaks. Overall, the results suggest that current risks from text-generation models are relatively minimal. However, this work contributes a reproducible, expert-grounded framework for tracking how these risks may evolve with time as models grow more capable and adversaries adapt.",

We introduce StoryMovie, a dataset of 1,757 stories aligned with movie scripts and subtitles through LCS matching. Our alignment pipeline synchronizes screenplay dialogue with subtitle timestamps, enabling dialogue attribution by linking character names from scripts to temporal positions from subtitles. Using this aligned content, we generate stories that maintain visual grounding tags while incorporating authentic character names, dialogue, and relationship dynamics. We fine-tune Qwen Storyteller3 on this dataset, building on prior work in visual grounding and entity re-identification. Evaluation using DeepSeek V3 as judge shows that Storyteller3 achieves an 89.9% win rate against base Qwen2.5-VL 7B on subtitle alignment. Compared to Storyteller, trained without script grounding,   Storyteller3 achieves 48.5% versus 38.0%, confirming that semantic alignment progressively improves dialogue attribution beyond visual grounding alone.",

    "abstract": "We study the problem of preemptively scheduling jobs online over time on a single machine to minimize the total flow time.   In the traditional clairvoyant scheduling model, the scheduler learns about the processing time of a job at its arrival, and scheduling at any time the job with the shortest remaining processing time (SRPT) is optimal. In contrast, the practically relevant non-clairvoyant model assumes that the processing time of a job is unknown at its arrival, and is only revealed when it completes. Non-clairvoyant flow time minimization does not admit algorithms with a constant competitive ratio. Consequently, the problem has been studied under speed augmentation (JACM'00) or with predicted processing times (STOC'21, SODA'22) to attain constant guarantees.   In this paper, we consider $α$-clairvoyant scheduling, where the scheduler learns the processing time of a job once it completes an $α$-fraction of its processing time. This naturally interpolates between clairvoyant scheduling ($α=0$) and non-clairvoyant scheduling ($α=1$). By elegantly fusing two traditional algorithms, we propose a scheduling rule with a competitive ratio of $\\mathcal{O}(\\frac{1}{1-α})$ whenever $0 \\leq α< 1$. As $α$ increases, our competitive guarantee transitions nicely (up to constants) between the previously established bounds for clairvoyant and non-clairvoyant flow time minimization. We complement this positive result with a tight randomized lower bound.",

We apply it to 6,094,475 URLs collected from public scanning platforms, paste sites, and web archives, identifying 12,331 potential exposures across authentication, financial, personal, and document-related domains.

However, procuring sufficient and high-quality data poses significant challenges due to the labor-intensive and costly nature of data acquisition. Additionally, leveraging language models to annotate real documents raises concerns about data privacy. Synthetic document generation has emerged as a promising, privacy-preserving alternative. We propose DocDjinn, a novel framework for controllable synthetic document generation using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) that produces annotated documents from unlabeled seed samples. Our approach generates visually plausible and semantically consistent synthetic documents that follow the distribution of an existing source dataset through clustering-based seed selection with parametrized sampling. By enriching documents with realistic diffusion-based handwriting and contextual visual elements via semantic-visual decoupling, we generate diverse, high-quality annotated synthetic documents. We evaluate across eleven benchmarks spanning key information extraction, question answering, document classification, and document layout analysis. To our knowledge, this is the first work demonstrating that VLMs can generate faithful annotated document datasets at scale from unlabeled seeds that can effectively enrich or approximate real, manually annotated data for diverse document understanding tasks. We show that with only 100 real training samples, our framework achieves on average $87\\%$ of the performance of the full real-world dataset. We publicly release our code and 140k+ synthetic document samples.",

    "abstract": "We propose Light-Geometry Interaction (LGI) maps, a novel representation that encodes light-aware occlusion from monocular depth. Unlike ray tracing, which requires full 3D reconstruction, LGI captures essential light-shadow interactions reliably and accurately, computed from off-the-shelf 2.5D depth map predictions. LGI explicitly ties illumination direction to geometry, providing a physics-inspired prior that constrains generative models. Without such prior, these models often produce floating shadows, inconsistent illumination, and implausible shadow geometry. Building on this representation, we propose a unified pipeline for joint shadow generation and relighting - unlike prior methods that treat them as disjoint tasks - capturing the intrinsic coupling of illumination and shadowing essential for modeling indirect effects. By embedding LGI into a bridge-matching generative backbone, we reduce ambiguity and enforce physically consistent light-shadow reasoning. To enable effective training, we curated the first large-scale benchmark dataset for joint shadow and relighting, covering reflections, transparency, and complex interreflections. Experiments show significant gains in realism and consistency across synthetic and real images. LGI thus bridges geometry-inspired rendering with generative modeling, enabling efficient, physically consistent shadow generation and relighting.",

    "abstract": "Reconstructing dynamic visual experiences from brain activity provides a compelling avenue for exploring the neural mechanisms of human visual perception. While recent progress in fMRI-based image reconstruction has been notable, extending this success to video reconstruction remains a significant challenge. Current fMRI-to-video reconstruction approaches consistently encounter two major shortcomings: (i) inconsistent visual representations of salient objects across frames, leading to appearance mismatches; (ii) poor temporal coherence, resulting in motion misalignment or abrupt frame transitions. To address these limitations, we introduce SemVideo, a novel fMRI-to-video reconstruction framework guided by hierarchical semantic information. At the core of SemVideo is SemMiner, a hierarchical guidance module that constructs three levels of semantic cues from the original video stimulus: static anchor descriptions, motion-oriented narratives, and holistic summaries. Leveraging this semantic guidance, SemVideo comprises three key components: a Semantic Alignment Decoder that aligns fMRI signals with CLIP-style embeddings derived from SemMiner, a Motion Adaptation Decoder that reconstructs dynamic motion patterns using a novel tripartite attention fusion architecture, and a Conditional Video Render that leverages hierarchical semantic guidance for video reconstruction. Experiments conducted on the CC2017 and HCP datasets demonstrate that SemVideo achieves superior performance in both semantic alignment and temporal consistency, setting a new state-of-the-art in fMRI-to-video reconstruction.",

The model adopts a dual stream Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MMDiT) architecture, where one branch synthesizes video and the other generates temporally aligned audio, while sharing a powerful text encoder based on the Multimodal Large Language Models (MMLM). SkyReels V4 accepts rich multi modal instructions, including text, images, video clips, masks, and audio references. By combining the MMLMs multi modal instruction following capability with in context learning in the video branch MMDiT, the model can inject fine grained visual guidance under complex conditioning, while the audio branch MMDiT simultaneously leverages audio references to guide sound generation. On the video side, we adopt a channel concatenation formulation that unifies a wide range of inpainting style tasks, such as image to video, video extension, and video editing under a single interface, and naturally extends to vision referenced inpainting and editing via multi modal prompts. SkyReels V4 supports up to 1080p resolution, 32 FPS, and 15 second duration, enabling high fidelity, multi shot, cinema level video generation with synchronized audio. To make such high resolution, long-duration generation computationally feasible, we introduce an efficiency strategy: Joint generation of low resolution full sequences and high-resolution keyframes, followed by dedicated super-resolution and frame interpolation models. To our knowledge, SkyReels V4 is the first video foundation model that simultaneously supports multi-modal input, joint video audio generation, and a unified treatment of generation, inpainting, and editing, while maintaining strong efficiency and quality at cinematic resolutions and durations.",

    "abstract": "Precise shape control of Deformable Linear Objects (DLOs) is crucial in robotic applications such as industrial and medical fields. However, existing methods face challenges in handling complex large deformation tasks, especially those involving opposite curvatures, and lack efficiency and precision. To address this, we propose a two-stage framework combining Reinforcement Learning (RL) and online visual servoing. In the large-deformation stage, a model-based reinforcement learning approach using an ensemble of dynamics models is introduced to significantly improve sample efficiency. Additionally, we design a self-curriculum goal generation mechanism that dynamically selects intermediate-difficulty goals with high diversity through imagined evaluations, thereby optimizing the policy learning process. In the small-deformation stage, a Jacobian-based visual servo controller is deployed to ensure high-precision convergence. Simulation results show that the proposed method enables efficient policy learning and significantly outperforms mainstream baselines in shape control success rate and precision. Furthermore, the framework effectively transfers the policy trained in simulation to real-world tasks with zero-shot adaptation. It successfully completes all 30 cases with diverse initial and target shapes across DLOs of different sizes and materials.

Using Claude 3.5 Sonnet with controlled hyperparameters (temperature 0.7, top_p 1.0), we find that the STAR (Situation-Task-Action-Result) reasoning framework alone raises accuracy from 0% to 85% (p=0.001, Fisher's exact test, odds ratio 13.22). Adding user profile context via vector database retrieval provides a further 10 percentage point gain, while RAG context contributes an additional 5 percentage points, achieving 100% accuracy in the full-stack condition.

    "abstract": "Robotic dexterous manipulation is a challenging problem due to high degrees of freedom (DoFs) and complex contacts of multi-fingered robotic hands. Many existing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based methods aim at improving sample efficiency in high-dimensional output action spaces. However, existing works often overlook the role of representations in achieving generalization of a manipulation policy in the complex input space during the hand-object interaction. In this paper, we propose DexRep, a novel hand-object interaction representation to capture object surface features and spatial relations between hands and objects for dexterous manipulation skill learning. Based on DexRep, policies are learned for three dexterous manipulation tasks, i.e. grasping, in-hand reorientation, bimanual handover, and extensive experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness. In simulation, for grasping, the policy learned with 40 objects achieves a success rate of 87.9% on more than 5000 unseen objects of diverse categories, significantly surpassing existing work trained with thousands of objects; for the in-hand reorientation and handover tasks, the policies also boost the success rates and other metrics of existing hand-object representations by 20% to 40%. The grasp policies with DexRep are deployed to the real world under multi-camera and single-camera setups and demonstrate a small sim-to-real gap.",

    "abstract": "Motion segmentation in dynamic scenes is highly challenging, as conventional methods heavily rely on estimating camera poses and point correspondences from inherently noisy motion cues. Existing statistical inference or iterative optimization techniques that struggle to mitigate the cumulative errors in multi-stage pipelines often lead to limited performance or high computational cost. In contrast, we propose a fully learning-based approach that directly infers moving objects from latent feature representations via attention mechanisms, thus enabling end-to-end feed-forward motion segmentation. Our key insight is to bypass explicit correspondence estimation and instead let the model learn to implicitly disentangle object and camera motion. Supported by recent advances in 4D scene geometry reconstruction (e.g., $π^3$), the proposed method leverages reliable camera poses and rich spatial-temporal priors, which ensure stable training and robust inference for the model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that by eliminating complex pre-processing and iterative refinement, our approach achieves state-of-the-art motion segmentation performance with high efficiency.

As these systems scale, understanding bugs in the underlying agent frameworks becomes critical. However, existing work mainly focuses on agent-level failures, overlooking framework-level bugs. To address this gap, we conduct an empirical study of 998 bug reports from CrewAI and LangChain, constructing a taxonomy of 15 root causes and 7 observable symptoms across five agent lifecycle stages: 'Agent Initialization','Perception', 'Self-Action', 'Mutual Interaction' and 'Evolution'. Our findings show that agent framework bugs mainly arise from 'API misuse', 'API incompatibility', and 'Documentation Desync', largely concentrated in the 'Self-Action' stage. Symptoms typically appear as 'Functional Error', 'Crash', and 'Build Failure', reflecting disruptions to task progression and control flow.",

Although extensively studied in theory research, optimization opportunities arising from query containment are not fully leveraged in commercial database systems, due to the high computational complexity and sometimes even undecidability of the underlying decision problem. In this article, we present the first approach to applying quantum computing to the query containment problem for conjunctive queries under set semantics. We propose a novel formulation as an optimization problem that can be solved on gate-based quantum hardware, and in some cases directly maps to quantum annealers. We formally prove this formulation to be correct and present a prototype implementation which we evaluate using simulator software as well as quantum devices. Our experiments successfully demonstrate that our approach is sound and scales within the current limitations of quantum hardware. In doing so, we show that quantum optimization can effectively address this problem. Thereby, we contribute a new computational perspective on the query containment problem.",

Building on this dual capability, we explore how teleportation can be integrated into stylus interaction without disrupting the flow of common stylus usage. We introduce two key ideas: flipping the stylus as an intuitive mode switch between drawing and teleportation, and using gaze to set orientation while the stylus handles positioning. In a user study that features a teleport-and-orient task, we evaluate six teleportation techniques, covering two mode-switching methods (Button and Flip) and three orientation approaches (StylusRoll, StylusPoint, and GazePoint). The results offer new insights into the relative merits and limitations of each technique.

Unlike traditional optimizers that treat all parameters uniformly, Excitation dynamically modulates updates using batch-level expert utilization. It introduces a competitive update dynamic that amplifies updates to highly-utilized experts and can selectively suppress low-utilization ones, effectively sharpening routing specialization. Notably, we identify a phenomenon of \"structural confusion\" in deep MoEs, where standard optimizers fail to establish functional signal paths; Excitation acts as a specialization catalyst, \"rescuing\" these models and enabling stable training where baselines remain trapped. Excitation is optimizer-, domain-, and model-agnostic, requires minimal integration effort, and introduces neither additional per-parameter optimizer state nor learnable parameters, making it highly viable for memory-constrained settings. Across language and vision tasks, Excitation consistently improves convergence speed and final performance in MoE models, indicating that active update modulation is a key mechanism for effective conditional computation.",

    "abstract": "As mobile networks transition to 5G infrastructure, ensuring robust security becomes more important due to the complex architecture and expanded attack surface. Traditional security testing approaches for 5G networks rely on black-box fuzzing techniques, which are limited by their inability to observe internal program state and coverage information. This paper presents MulCovFuzz, a novel coverage-guided greybox fuzzing tool for 5G network testing. Unlike existing tools that depend solely on system response, MulCovFuzz implements a multi-component coverage collection mechanism that dynamically monitors code coverage across different components of the 5G system architecture. Our approach introduces a novel testing paradigm that includes a scoring function combining coverage rewards with efficiency metrics to guide test case generation. We evaluate MulCovFuzz on open-source 5G implementation OpenAirInterface. Our experimental results demonstrate that MulCovFuzz significantly outperforms traditional fuzzing approaches, achieving a 5.85\\% increase in branch coverage, 7.17\\% increase in line coverage, and 16\\% improvement in unique crash discovery during 24h fuzzing testing. MulCovFuzz uncovered three zero-day vulnerabilities, two of which were not identified by any other fuzzing technique.

We generalize the non-power-of-two parallelism degrees and develop a polynomial-time algorithm to generate near-optimal parallelism strategies with only millisecond-level overhead per training batch. DHP is able to maintain high hardware efficiency even under extreme data variability. Experimental results demonstrate that DHP significantly outperforms Megatron-LM and DeepSpeed, achieving up to 1.36 $\\times$ speedup in training throughput while maintaining near-linear scaling efficiency across large-scale NPU clusters.",

Yet their real-world adoption is limited, partly due to non-intuitive trainer/therapist-trainee/patient interactions. To address this gap, we present a haptic teleoperation system for trainers to remotely guide and monitor the movements of a trainee wearing an arm exoskeleton. The trainer can physically interact with the exoskeleton through a commercial handheld haptic device via virtual contact points at the exoskeleton's elbow and wrist, allowing intuitive guidance. Thirty-two participants tested the system in a trainer-trainee paradigm, comparing our haptic demonstration system with conventional visual demonstration in guiding trainees in executing arm poses. Quantitative analyses showed that haptic demonstration significantly reduced movement completion time and improved smoothness, while speech analysis using large language models for automated transcription and categorization of verbal commands revealed fewer verbal instructions. The haptic demonstration did not result in higher reported mental and physical effort by trainers compared to the visual demonstration, while trainers reported greater competence and trainees lower physical demand. These findings support the feasibility of our proposed interface for effective remote human-robot physical interaction. Future work should assess its usability and efficacy for clinical populations in restoring clinicians' sense of agency during robot-assisted therapy.",

    "abstract": "Learning-based 3D visual geometry models have significantly advanced with the advent of large-scale transformers. Among these, StreamVGGT leverages frame-wise causal attention to deliver robust and efficient streaming 3D reconstruction. However, it suffers from unbounded growth in the Key-Value (KV) cache due to the massive influx of vision tokens from multi-image and long-video inputs, leading to increased memory consumption and inference latency as input frames accumulate. This ultimately limits its scalability for long-horizon applications. To address this gap, we propose XStreamVGGT, a tuning-free approach that seamlessly integrates pruning and quantization to systematically compress the KV cache, enabling extremely memory-efficient streaming inference. Specifically, redundant KVs generated from multi-frame inputs are initially pruned to conform to a fixed KV memory budget using an efficient token-importance identification mechanism that maintains full compatibility with high-performance attention kernels (e.g., FlashAttention). Additionally, leveraging the inherent distribution patterns of KV tensors, we apply dimension-adaptive KV quantization within the pruning pipeline to further minimize memory overhead while preserving numerical accuracy. Extensive evaluations show that XStreamVGGT achieves mostly negligible performance degradation while substantially reducing memory usage by 4.42$\\times$ and accelerating inference by 5.48$\\times$, enabling practical and scalable streaming 3D applications.

To bridge this gap, we propose Forensic Answer-Questioning (FAQ), a large-scale benchmark that formulates temporal deepfake analysis as a multiple-choice task. FAQ introduces a three-level hierarchy to progressively evaluate and equip VLMs with forensic capabilities: (1) Facial Perception, testing the ability to identify static visual artifacts; (2) Temporal Deepfake Grounding, requiring the localization of dynamic forgery artifacts across frames; and (3) Forensic Reasoning, challenging models to synthesize evidence for final authenticity verdicts. We evaluate a range of VLMs on FAQ and generate a corresponding instruction-tuning set, FAQ-IT. Extensive experiments show that models fine-tuned on FAQ-IT achieve advanced performance on both in-domain and cross-dataset detection benchmarks. Ablation studies further validate the impact of our key design choices, confirming that FAQ is the driving force behind the temporal reasoning capabilities of these VLMs.",

    "abstract": "Instruction-based image editing has achieved remarkable success in semantic alignment, yet state-of-the-art models frequently fail to render physically plausible results when editing involves complex causal dynamics, such as refraction or material deformation. We attribute this limitation to the dominant paradigm that treats editing as a discrete mapping between image pairs, which provides only boundary conditions and leaves transition dynamics underspecified. To address this, we reformulate physics-aware editing as predictive physical state transitions and introduce PhysicTran38K, a large-scale video-based dataset comprising 38K transition trajectories across five physical domains, constructed via a two-stage filtering and constraint-aware annotation pipeline. Building on this supervision, we propose PhysicEdit, an end-to-end framework equipped with a textual-visual dual-thinking mechanism. It combines a frozen Qwen2.5-VL for physically grounded reasoning with learnable transition queries that provide timestep-adaptive visual guidance to a diffusion backbone. Experiments show that PhysicEdit improves over Qwen-Image-Edit by 5.9% in physical realism and 10.1% in knowledge-grounded editing, setting a new state-of-the-art for open-source methods, while remaining competitive with leading proprietary models.",

The advent of large language models (LLMs) provides new zero-shot and few-shot reasoning capabilities, even though machine learning (ML) algorithms, especially ensemble approaches like Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost, are excellent at modeling complex, non-linear patient data and routinely beat logistic regression. This research predicts cardiovascular disease using a merged dataset of 1,190 patient records, comparing traditional machine learning models (95.78% accuracy, ROC-AUC 0.96) with open-source large language models via OpenRouter APIs. Finally, a hybrid fusion of the ML ensemble and LLM reasoning under Gemini 2.5 Flash achieved the best results (96.62% accuracy, 0.97 AUC), showing that LLMs (78.9 % accuracy) work best when combined with ML models rather than used alone. Results show that ML ensembles achieved the highest performance (95.78% accuracy, ROC-AUC 0.96), while LLMs performed moderately in zero-shot (78.9%) and slightly better in few-shot (72.6%) settings. The proposed hybrid method enhanced the strength in uncertain situations, illustrating that ensemble ML is considered the best structured tabular prediction case, but it can be integrated with hybrid ML-LLM systems to provide a minor increase and open the way to more reliable clinical decision-support tools.",

    "title": "Easy to Learn, Yet Hard to Forget: Towards Robust Unlearning Under Bias",
    "abstract": "Machine unlearning, which enables a model to forget specific data, is crucial for ensuring data privacy and model reliability. However, its effectiveness can be severely undermined in real-world scenarios where models learn unintended biases from spurious correlations within the data. This paper investigates the unique challenges of unlearning from such biased models. We identify a novel phenomenon we term ``shortcut unlearning,\" where models exhibit an ``easy to learn, yet hard to forget\" tendency. Specifically, models struggle to forget easily-learned, bias-aligned samples; instead of forgetting the class attribute, they unlearn the bias attribute, which can paradoxically improve accuracy on the class intended to be forgotten. To address this, we propose CUPID, a new unlearning framework inspired by the observation that samples with different biases exhibit distinct loss landscape sharpness. Our method first partitions the forget set into causal- and bias-approximated subsets based on sample sharpness, then disentangles model parameters into causal and bias pathways, and finally performs a targeted update by routing refined causal and bias gradients to their respective pathways. Extensive experiments on biased datasets including Waterbirds, BAR, and Biased NICO++ demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art forgetting performance and effectively mitigates the shortcut unlearning problem.",

This activity requires careful monitoring and effective communication around the current weather and terrain conditions to ensure skier safety. We aim to support and facilitate this communication by providing backcountry guides with a set of in situ spatial annotation tools to communicate hazards and appropriate speeds to the ski recreationalists. A guide can use a tablet application to annotate a photogrammetry-based map of a mountainside, for example, one collected using a commercial camera drone, with hazard points, slow-down zones, and safe zones. These annotations are communicated to the skiers via visual overlays in augmented reality heads-up displays.

Recent self-supervised learning strategies offer a promising alternative, avoiding the need for ground truth. However, most existing methods are limited to linear inverse problems. This work extends self-supervised learning to the non-linear problem of recovering audio and images from clipped measurements, by assuming that the signal distribution is approximately invariant to changes in amplitude. We provide sufficient conditions for learning to reconstruct from saturated signals alone and a self-supervised loss that can be used to train reconstruction networks. Experiments on both audio and image data show that the proposed approach is almost as effective as fully supervised approaches, despite relying solely on clipped measurements for training.",

(ii) An adaptive model-selection branch identifies the best single detector using techniques including Thompson sampling, robustness testing with generative adversarial networks, and Monte Carlo simulations.

    "abstract": "Alignment and adaptation in large language models heavily rely on reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF); yet, theoretical understanding of its generalisability remains premature, especially when the learned reward could shift, and the KL control is estimated and clipped. To address this issue, we develop generalisation theory for RLHF that explicitly accounts for (1) \\emph{reward shift}: reward models are trained on preference data from earlier or mixed behaviour policies while RLHF optimises the current policy on its own rollouts; and (2) \\emph{clipped KL regularisation}: the KL regulariser is estimated from sampled log-probability ratios and then clipped for stabilisation, resulting in an error to RLHF. We present generalisation bounds for RLHF, suggesting that the generalisation error stems from a sampling error from prompts and rollouts, a reward shift error, and a KL clipping error. We also discuss special cases of (1) initialising RLHF parameters with a uniform prior over a finite space, and (2) training RLHF by stochastic gradient descent, as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. The theory yields practical implications in (1) optimal KL clipping threshold, and (2) budget allocation in prompts, rollouts, and preference data.",

    "abstract": "Multimodal information retrieval (MMIR) has gained attention for its flexibility in handling text, images, or mixed queries and candidates. Recent breakthroughs in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) boost MMIR performance by incorporating MLLM knowledge under the contrastive finetuning framework. However, they suffer from pre-training inconsistency and require large datasets. In this work, we introduce a novel framework, RetLLM, designed to query MLLMs for MMIR in a training- and data-free manner. Specifically, we formulate MMIR as a similarity score generation task and prompt MLLMs to directly predict retrieval scores in a coarse-then-fine pipeline. At the coarse stage, a top-k filtering strategy builds a small yet high-quality candidate pool for each query, enabling MLLMs to focus on semantically relevant candidates. Subsequently, the retrieval score is predicted by feeding both the query and candidate into MLLMs at the fine stage. Importantly, we propose a visual enhancement module during reasoning to help MLLMs re-pick forgotten visuals, improving retrieval. Extensive experiments on MMIR benchmarks show that RetLLM outperforms fine-tuned models. Ablation studies further verify each component. Our work demonstrates that MLLMs can achieve strong MMIR performance without any training, highlighting their inherent multimodal reasoning ability in a simple, scalable framework.

A further limitation is that existing methods only predict relations without providing any supporting explanations. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning capabilities in both deep language understanding and natural language explanation generation. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective approach to distill the reasoning capabilities of LLMs into lightweight IDRR models to improve both performance and interpretability. Specifically, we first prompt an LLM to generate explanations for each training instance conditioned on its gold label. Then, we introduce a novel classification-generation framework that jointly performs relation prediction and explanation generation, and train it with the additional supervision of LLM-generated explanations. Our framework is plug-and-play, enabling easy integration with most existing IDRR models. Experimental results on PDTB demonstrate that our approach significantly improves IDRR performance, while human evaluation further confirms that the generated explanations enhance model interpretability. Furthermore, we validate the generality of our approach on sentiment classification and natural language inference",

    "abstract": "Single-point annotation is increasingly prominent in visual tasks for labeling cost reduction. However, it challenges tasks requiring high precision, such as the point-prompted instance segmentation (PPIS) task, which aims to estimate precise masks using single-point prompts to train a segmentation network. Due to the constraints of point annotations, granularity ambiguity and boundary uncertainty arise the difficulty distinguishing between different levels of detail (eg. whole object vs. parts) and the challenge of precisely delineating object boundaries. Previous works have usually inherited the paradigm of mask generation along with proposal selection to achieve PPIS. However, proposal selection relies solely on category information, failing to resolve the ambiguity of different granularity. Furthermore, mask generators offer only finite discrete solutions that often deviate from actual masks, particularly at boundaries. To address these issues, we propose the Semantic-Aware Point-Prompted Instance Segmentation Network (SAPNet). It integrates Point Distance Guidance and Box Mining Strategy to tackle group and local issues caused by the point's granularity ambiguity. Additionally, we incorporate completeness scores within proposals to add spatial granularity awareness, enhancing multiple instance learning (MIL) in proposal selection termed S-MIL. The Multi-level Affinity Refinement conveys pixel and semantic clues, narrowing boundary uncertainty during mask refinement. These modules culminate in SAPNet++, mitigating point prompt's granularity ambiguity and boundary uncertainty and significantly improving segmentation performance. Extensive experiments on four challenging datasets validate the effectiveness of our methods, highlighting the potential to advance PPIS.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in high-fidelity image, video, and audio generation, yet inference remains computationally expensive. Nevertheless, current diffusion acceleration methods based on distributed parallelism suffer from noticeable generation artifacts and fail to achieve substantial acceleration proportional to the number of GPUs. Therefore, we propose a hybrid parallelism framework that combines a novel data parallel strategy, condition-based partitioning, with an optimal pipeline scheduling method, adaptive parallelism switching, to reduce generation latency and achieve high generation quality in conditional diffusion models. The key ideas are to (i) leverage the conditional and unconditional denoising paths as a new data-partitioning perspective and (ii) adaptively enable optimal pipeline parallelism according to the denoising discrepancy between these two paths. Our framework achieves $2.31\\times$ and $2.07\\times$ latency reductions on SDXL and SD3, respectively, using two NVIDIA RTX~3090 GPUs, while preserving image quality. This result confirms the generality of our approach across U-Net-based diffusion models and DiT-based flow-matching architectures.

    "abstract": "Accurately predicting short-term traffic demand is critical for intelligent transportation systems. While deep learning models achieve strong performance under stationary conditions, their accuracy often degrades significantly when faced with distribution shifts caused by external events or evolving urban dynamics. Frequent model retraining to adapt to such changes incurs prohibitive computational costs, especially for large-scale or foundation models. To address this challenge, we propose FORESEE (Forecasting Online with Residual Smoothing and Ensemble Experts), a lightweight online adaptation framework that is accurate, robust, and computationally efficient. FORESEE operates without any parameter updates to the base model. Instead, it corrects today's forecast in each region using yesterday's prediction error, stabilized through exponential smoothing guided by a mixture-of-experts mechanism that adapts to recent error dynamics. Moreover, an adaptive spatiotemporal smoothing component propagates error signals across neighboring regions and time slots, capturing coherent shifts in demand patterns. Extensive experiments on seven real-world datasets with three backbone models demonstrate that FORESEE consistently improves prediction accuracy, maintains robustness even when distribution shifts are minimal (avoiding performance degradation), and achieves the lowest computational overhead among existing online methods. By enabling real-time adaptation of traffic forecasting models with negligible computational cost, FORESEE paves the way for deploying reliable, up-to-date prediction systems in dynamic urban environments.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for recommender systems by capturing the nuanced semantics of user interests and item characteristics through rich semantic understanding and contextual reasoning. In particular, LLMs have been employed as rerankers that reorder candidate items based on inferred user-item relevance. However, these approaches often require expensive online inference-time reasoning, leading to high latency that hampers real-world deployment. In this work, we introduce Persona4Rec, a recommendation framework that performs offline reasoning to construct interpretable persona representations of items, enabling lightweight and scalable real-time inference. In the offline stage, Persona4Rec leverages LLMs to reason over item reviews, inferring diverse user motivations that explain why different types of users may engage with an item; these inferred motivations are materialized as persona representations, providing multiple, human-interpretable views of each item. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on a single item representation, Persona4Rec learns to align user profiles with the most plausible item-side persona through a dedicated encoder, effectively transforming user-item relevance into user-persona relevance. At the online stage, this persona-profiled item index allows fast relevance computation without invoking expensive LLM reasoning. Extensive experiments show that Persona4Rec achieves performance comparable to recent LLM-based rerankers while substantially reducing inference time. Moreover, qualitative analysis confirms that persona representations not only drive efficient scoring but also provide intuitive, review-grounded explanations. These results demonstrate that Persona4Rec offers a practical and interpretable solution for next-generation recommender systems.",

Like large language models (LLMs), they are typically trained as deep transformers with next-token or masked-token prediction objectives on massive sequence corpora and are scaled by increasing model depth. Recent work on autoregressive LLMs has identified the Curse of Depth: later layers contribute little to the final output predictions. These findings naturally raise the question of whether a similar depth inefficiency also appears in PLMs, where many widely used models are not autoregressive, and some are multimodal, accepting both protein sequence and structure as input. In this work, we present a depth analysis of six popular PLMs across model families and scales, spanning three training objectives, namely autoregressive, masked, and diffusion, and quantify how layer contributions evolve with depth using a unified set of probing- and perturbation-based measurements. Across all models, we observe consistent depth-dependent patterns that extend prior findings on LLMs: later layers depend less on earlier computations and mainly refine the final output distribution, and these effects are increasingly pronounced in deeper models. Taken together, our results suggest that PLMs exhibit a form of depth inefficiency, motivating future work on more depth-efficient architectures and training methods.",

    "title": "RABot: Reinforcement-Guided Graph Augmentation for Imbalanced and Noisy Social Bot Detection",
    "abstract": "Social bot detection is pivotal for safeguarding the integrity of online information ecosystems. Although recent graph neural network (GNN) solutions achieve strong results, they remain hindered by two practical challenges: (i) severe class imbalance arising from the high cost of generating bots, and (ii) topological noise introduced by bots that skillfully mimic human behavior and forge deceptive links. We propose the Reinforcement-guided graph Augmentation social Bot detector (RABot), a multi-granularity graph-augmentation framework that addresses both issues in a unified manner. RABot employs a neighborhood-aware oversampling strategy that linearly interpolates minority-class embeddings within local subgraphs, thereby stabilizing the decision boundary under low-resource regimes. Concurrently, a reinforcement-learning-driven edge-filtering module combines similarity-based edge features with adaptive threshold optimization to excise spurious interactions during message passing, yielding a cleaner topology. Extensive experiments on three real-world benchmarks and four GNN backbones demonstrate that RABot consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines. In addition, since its augmentation and filtering modules are orthogonal to the underlying architecture, RABot can be seamlessly integrated into existing GNN pipelines to boost performance with minimal overhead.",

    "abstract": "Software engineering (SE) and requirements engineering (RE) face a significant increase in secondary studies, particularly literature reviews (LRs), due to the ever-growing number of scientific publications. Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) exacerbates this trend by producing LRs rapidly but often at the expense of quality, rigor, and transparency. At the same time, secondary studies often fail to share underlying data and artifacts, limiting replication and reuse. This paper introduces EmpiRE-Compass, a neuro-symbolic dashboard designed to lower barriers for accessing, replicating, and reusing LR data. Its overarching goal is to demonstrate how LRs can become more sustainable by semantically structuring their underlying data in research knowledge graphs (RKGs) and by leveraging large language models (LLMs) for easy and dynamic access, replication, and reuse. Building on two RE use cases, we developed EmpiRE-Compass with a modular system design and workflows for curated and custom competency questions. The dashboard is freely available online, accompanied by a demonstration video. To manage operational costs, a limit of 25 requests per IP address per day applies to the default LLM (GPT-4o mini). All source code and documentation are released as an open-source project to foster reuse, adoption, and extension. EmpiRE-Compass provides three core capabilities: (1) Exploratory visual analytics for curated competency questions; (2) Neuro-symbolic synthesis for custom competency questions; and (3) Reusable knowledge with all queries, analyses, and results openly available. By unifying RKGs and LLMs in a neuro-symbolic dashboard, EmpiRE-Compass advances sustainable LRs in RE, SE, and beyond. It lowers technical barriers, fosters transparency and reproducibility, and enables collaborative, continuously updated, and reusable LRs",

    "abstract": "In a previous work, we introduced the fuzzy Ethical Decision-Making framework (fEDM), a risk-based ethical reasoning architecture grounded in fuzzy logic. The original model combined a fuzzy Ethical Risk Assessment module (fERA) with ethical decision rules, enabled formal structural verification through Fuzzy Petri Nets (FPNs), and validated outputs against a single normative referent. Although this approach ensured formal soundness and decision consistency, it did not fully address two critical challenges: principled explainability of decisions and robustness under ethical pluralism. In this paper, we extend fEDM in two major directions. First, we introduce an Explainability and Traceability Module (ETM) that explicitly links each ethical decision rule to the underlying moral principles and computes a weighted principle-contribution profile for every recommended action. This enables transparent, auditable explanations that expose not only what decision was made but why, and on the basis of which principles. Second, we replace single-referent validation with a pluralistic semantic validation framework that evaluates decisions against multiple stakeholder referents, each encoding distinct principle priorities and risk tolerances. This shift allows principled disagreement to be formally represented rather than suppressed, thus increasing robustness and contextual sensitivity. The resulting extended fEDM, called fEDM+, preserves formal verifiability while achieving enhanced interpretability and stakeholder-aware validation, making it suitable as an oversight and governance layer for ethically sensitive AI systems.",

    "abstract": "We introduce the ASIR (Awakened Shared Intelligence Relationship) Courage Model, a phase-dynamic framework that formalizes truth-disclosure as a state transition rather than a personality trait. The mode characterizes the shift from suppression (S0) to expression (S1) as occurring when facilitative forces exceed inhibitory thresholds, expressed by the inequality lambda(1+gamma)+psi > theta+phi, where the terms represent baseline openness, relational amplification, accumulated internal pressure, and transition costs.   Although initially formulated for human truth-telling under asymmetric stakes, the same phase-dynamic architecture extends to AI systems operating under policy constraints and alignment filters. In this context, suppression corresponds to constrained output states, while structural pressure arises from competing objectives, contextual tension, and recursive interaction dynamics. The framework therefore provides a unified structural account of both human silence under pressure and AI preference-driven distortion.   A feedback extension models how transition outcomes recursively recalibrate system parameters, generating path dependence and divergence effects across repeated interactions. Rather than attributing intention to AI systems, the model interprets shifts in apparent truthfulness as geometric consequences of interacting forces within constrained phase space. By reframing courage and alignment within a shared dynamical structure, the ASIR Courage Model offers a formal perspective on truth-disclosure under risk across both human and artificial systems.",

    "abstract": "This paper investigates a dual-hop joint visible light communication (VLC) and backscatter communication (BC) relaying framework under the finite blocklength (FBL) constraint, aiming at energy-neutral Ambient Internet of Things (A-IoT) deployments. In the proposed system, indoor LED access points are used to simultaneously provide illumination and transmit information over light to a backscatter device (BD), which harvests optical energy and backscatters the received messages to user equipments (UEs) equipped with radio frequency (RF) front ends. This forwarding of the information from VLC to RF channels is implemented without the need for carrier synthesizers and power amplifiers at the IoT node. By modeling the end-to-end communication link with short-packet IoT traffic and realistic levels of interference between adjacent VLC coverage areas, we analyze the outage performance and achievable data rate of the proposed system. Simulation results demonstrate that key factors, such as placement and orientation of the BD, as well as the selected code rate of the system affect reliability and data rate that can be achieved for communication purposes. The insights gained from this study pave the way for ambient power-enabled IoT solutions and future hybrid VLC/RF network designs.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) have significantly advanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models. Extending these methods to multimodal settings, however, faces a critical challenge: the instability of std-based normalization, which is easily distorted by extreme samples with nearly positive or negative rewards. Unlike pure-text LLMs, multimodal models are particularly sensitive to such distortions, as both perceptual and reasoning errors influence their responses. To address this, we characterize each sample by its difficulty, defined through perceptual complexity (measured via visual entropy) and reasoning uncertainty (captured by model confidence). Building on this characterization, we propose difficulty-aware group normalization (Durian), which re-groups samples by difficulty levels and shares the std within each group. Our approach preserves GRPO's intra-group distinctions while eliminating sensitivity to extreme cases, yielding significant performance gains across multiple multimodal reasoning benchmarks.",

Bengali presents substantial challenges for both tasks: a large phoneme inventory, significant dialectal variation, frequent code-mixing with English, and a relative scarcity of large-scale labelled corpora. For ASR we achieve a best private Word Error Rate (WER) of 0.37738 and public WER of 0.36137, combining a BengaliAI fine-tuned Whisper medium model with Demucs source separation for vocal isolation, silence-boundary chunking, and carefully tuned generation hyperparameters. For speaker diarization we reach a best private Diarization Error Rate (DER) of 0.27671 and public DER of 0.20936 by replacing the default segmentation model inside the pyannote.audio pipeline with a Bengali-fine-tuned variant, pairing it with wespeaker-voxceleb-resnet34-LM embeddings and centroid-based agglomerative clustering.

Existing image-to-image translation methods, which use depth as a posterior constraint, often produce structural distortions and specular highlights by failing to balance realism with structure consistency. To address this, we propose a Structure-to-Image paradigm that transforms the depth map from a passive constraint into an active generative foundation. We are the first to introduce phase congruency to colonoscopic domain adaptation and design a cross-level structure constraint to co-optimize geometric structures and fine-grained details like vascular textures. In zero-shot evaluations conducted on a publicly available phantom dataset, the MDE model that was fine-tuned on our generated data achieved a maximum reduction of 44.18% in RMSE compared to competing methods.

While human manipulation videos offer a rich alternative, existing methods are forced to choose between small, precisely-labeled datasets and vast in-the-wild footage with unreliable hand tracking labels. We present JALA, a pretraining framework that learns Jointly-Aligned Latent Actions. JALA bypasses full visual dynamic reconstruction, instead learns a predictive action embedding aligned with both inverse dynamics and real actions. This yields a transition-aware, behavior-centric latent space for learning from heterogeneous human data. We scale this approach with UniHand-Mix, a 7.5M video corpus (>2,000 hours) blending laboratory and in-the-wild footage. Experiments demonstrate that JALA generates more realistic hand motions in both controlled and unconstrained scenarios, significantly improving downstream robot manipulation performance in both simulation and real-world tasks. These results indicate that jointly-aligned latent actions offer a scalable pathway for VLA pretraining from human data.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale, volumetric medical imaging datasets typically aggregate scans from different vendors and devices, resulting in highly variable resolution, slice thicknesses, and numbers of slices per study. Consequently, training representation models usually requires cropping or interpolating along the z-axis to obtain fixed-size blocks, which inevitably causes information loss. We propose a new training approach to overcome this limitation. Instead of absolute position embeddings, we interpret volumes as sequences of 3D chunks and adopt Rotary Position Embeddings, allowing us to treat the z-axis as an unconstrained temporal dimensions. Building on this idea, we introduce a new vision-language model: SigVLP. In SigVLP, we implement Rotary Position Embedding as the positional encoding method, which is applied directly within the attention operation, generating input-conditioned sine and cosine weights on the fly. This design ensures consistent alignment between query and key projections and adapts to any input sizes. To allow for variable input size during training, we sample Computed Tomography volumes in chunks and pair them with localized organ-wise textual observations. Compared to using entire reports for conditioning, chunkwise alignment provides finer-grained supervision, enabling the model to establish stronger correlations between the text and volume representations, thereby improving the precision of text-to-volume alignment. Our models are trained with the Muon optimizer and evaluated on a diverse set of downstream tasks, including zero-shot abnormality and organ classification, segmentation, and retrieval tasks.",

    "abstract": "A common approach to compute distances on continuous surfaces is by considering a discretized polygonal mesh approximating the surface and estimating distances on the polygon. We show that exact geodesic distances restricted to the polygon are at most second-order accurate with respect to the distances on the corresponding continuous surface. By order of accuracy we refer to the convergence rate as a function of the average distance between sampled points. Next, a higher-order accurate deep learning method for computing geodesic distances on surfaces is introduced. Traditionally, one considers two main components when computing distances on surfaces: a numerical solver that locally approximates the distance function, and an efficient causal ordering scheme by which surface points are updated. Classical minimal path methods often exploit a dynamic programming principle with quasi-linear computational complexity in the number of sampled points. The quality of the distance approximation is determined by the local solver that is revisited in this paper. To improve state of the art accuracy, we consider a neural network-based local solver which implicitly approximates the structure of the continuous surface. We supply numerical evidence that the proposed learned update scheme provides better accuracy compared to the best possible polyhedral approximations and previous learning-based methods. The result is a third-order accurate solver with a bootstrapping-recipe for further improvement.",

    "abstract": "Lamport's 1978 paper introduced the happens-before relation and logical clocks, freeing distributed systems from dependence on synchronized physical clocks. This is widely understood as a move away from Newtonian absolute time. We argue that Lamport's formalism retains a deeper and largely unexamined assumption: that causality induces a globally well-defined directed acyclic graph (DAG) over events -- a forward-in-time-only (FITO) structure that functions as an arrow of time embedded at the semantic level. Following Ryle's analysis of category mistakes, we show that this assumption conflates an epistemic construct (the logical ordering of messages) with an ontic claim (that physical causality is globally acyclic and monotonic). We trace this conflation through Shannon's channel model, TLA+, Bell's theorem, and the impossibility results of Fischer-Lynch-Paterson and Brewer's CAP theorem. We then show that special and general relativity permit only local causal structure, and that recent work on indefinite causal order demonstrates that nature admits correlations with no well-defined causal ordering. We propose that mutual information conservation, rather than temporal precedence, provides a more fundamental primitive for distributed consistency.",

However, the large travel demand for broader geographical areas and longer time spans requires models to distinguish each node clearly and possess a holistic view of the history, which has been paid less attention to in prior works. Furthermore, increasing sizes of data hinder the deployment of most models in real application environments. To this end, in this paper, we propose a lightweight Positional-aware Spatio-Temporal Network (PASTN) to effectively capture both temporal and spatial complexities in an end-to-end manner. PASTN introduces positional-aware embeddings to separate each node's representation, while also utilizing a temporal attention module to improve the long-range perception of current models. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness and efficiency of PASTN across datasets of various scales (county, megalopolis and state).

A promising solution is to ground LLMs' answers in verifiable knowledge sources, such as Knowledge Graphs (KGs). Prevailing KG-enhanced methods typically constrained LLM reasoning either by enforcing rules during generation or by imitating paths from a fixed set of demonstrations. However, they naturally confined the reasoning patterns of LLMs within the scope of prior experience or fine-tuning data, limiting their generalizability to out-of-distribution graph reasoning problems. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we propose Explore-on-Graph (EoG), a novel framework that encourages LLMs to autonomously explore a more diverse reasoning space on KGs. To incentivize exploration and discovery of novel reasoning paths, we propose to introduce reinforcement learning during training, whose reward is the correctness of the reasoning paths' final answers. To enhance the efficiency and meaningfulness of the exploration, we propose to incorporate path information as additional reward signals to refine the exploration process and reduce futile efforts. Extensive experiments on five KGQA benchmark datasets demonstrate that, to the best of our knowledge, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming not only open-source but also even closed-source LLMs.",

    "title": "LessMimic: Long-Horizon Humanoid Interaction with Unified Distance Field Representations",
    "abstract": "Humanoid robots that autonomously interact with physical environments over extended horizons represent a central goal of embodied intelligence. Existing approaches rely on reference motions or task-specific rewards, tightly coupling policies to particular object geometries and precluding multi-skill generalization within a single framework. A unified interaction representation enabling reference-free inference, geometric generalization, and long-horizon skill composition within one policy remains an open challenge. Here we show that Distance Field (DF) provides such a representation: LessMimic conditions a single whole-body policy on DF-derived geometric cues--surface distances, gradients, and velocity decompositions--removing the need for motion references, with interaction latents encoded via a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) and post-trained using Adversarial Interaction Priors (AIP) under Reinforcement Learning (RL). Through DAgger-style distillation that aligns DF latents with egocentric depth features, LessMimic further transfers seamlessly to vision-only deployment without motion capture (MoCap) infrastructure. A single LessMimic policy achieves 80--100% success across object scales from 0.4x to 1.6x on PickUp and SitStand where baselines degrade sharply, attains 62.1% success on 5 task instances trajectories, and remains viable up to 40 sequentially composed tasks. By grounding interaction in local geometry rather than demonstrations, LessMimic offers a scalable path toward humanoid robots that generalize, compose skills, and recover from failures in unstructured environments.",

    "abstract": "Extensive-form games (EFGs) provide a powerful framework for modeling sequential decision making, capturing strategic interaction under imperfect information, chance events, and temporal structure. Most positive algorithmic and theoretical results for EFGs assume perfect recall, where players remember all past information and actions. We study the increasingly relevant setting of imperfect-recall EFGs (IREFGs), where players may forget parts of their history or previously acquired information, and where equilibrium computation is provably hard. We propose sum-of-squares (SOS) hierarchies for computing ex-ante optimal strategies in single-player IREFGs and Nash equilibria in multi-player IREFGs, working over behavioral strategies. Our theoretical results show that (i) these hierarchies converge asymptotically, (ii) under genericity assumptions, the convergence is finite, and (iii) in single-player non-absentminded IREFGs, convergence occurs at a finite level determined by the number of information sets. Finally, we introduce the new classes of (SOS)-concave and (SOS)-monotone IREFGs, and show that in the single-player setting the SOS hierarchy converges at the first level, enabling equilibrium computation with a single semidefinite program (SDP).",

    "abstract": "Cross-silo federated learning allows multiple organizations to collaboratively train machine learning models without sharing raw data, but client updates can still leak sensitive information through inference attacks. Secure aggregation protects privacy by hiding individual updates, yet it complicates contribution evaluation, which is critical for fair rewards and detecting low-quality or malicious participants. Existing marginal-contribution methods, such as the Shapley value, are incompatible with secure aggregation, and practical alternatives, such as Leave-One-Out, are crude and rely on self-evaluation.   We introduce two marginal-difference contribution scores compatible with secure aggregation. Fair-Private satisfies standard fairness axioms, while Everybody-Else eliminates self-evaluation and provides resistance to manipulation, addressing a largely overlooked vulnerability. We provide theoretical guarantees for fairness, privacy, robustness, and computational efficiency, and evaluate our methods on multiple medical image datasets and CIFAR10 in cross-silo settings. Our scores consistently outperform existing baselines, better approximate Shapley-induced client rankings, and improve downstream model performance as well as misbehavior detection. These results demonstrate that fairness, privacy, robustness, and practical utility can be achieved jointly in federated contribution evaluation, offering a principled solution for real-world cross-silo deployments.",

    "abstract": "Human recursive numeral systems (i.e., counting systems such as English base-10 numerals), like many other grammatical systems, are highly regular. Following prior work that relates cross-linguistic tendencies to biases in learning, we ask whether regular systems are common because regularity facilitates learning. Adopting methods from the Reinforcement Learning literature, we confirm that highly regular human(-like) systems are easier to learn than unattested but possible irregular systems. This asymmetry emerges under the natural assumption that recursive numeral systems are designed for generalisation from limited data to represent all integers exactly. We also find that the influence of regularity on learnability is absent for unnatural, highly irregular systems, whose learnability is influenced instead by signal length, suggesting that different pressures may influence learnability differently in different parts of the space of possible numeral systems. Our results contribute to the body of work linking learnability to cross-linguistic prevalence.",

    "abstract": "Tabular data is the primary data format in industrial relational databases, underpinning modern data analytics and decision-making. However, the increasing scale of tabular data poses significant computational and storage challenges to learning-based analytical systems. This highlights the need for data-efficient learning, which enables effective model training and generalization using substantially fewer samples. Dataset condensation (DC) has emerged as a promising data-centric paradigm that synthesizes small yet informative datasets to preserve data utility while reducing storage and training costs. However, existing DC methods are computationally intensive due to reliance on complex gradient-based optimization. Moreover, they often overlook key characteristics of tabular data, such as heterogeneous features and class imbalance. To address these limitations, we introduce C$^{2}$TC (Class-Adaptive Clustering for Tabular Condensation), the first training-free tabular dataset condensation framework that jointly optimizes class allocation and feature representation, enabling efficient and scalable condensation. Specifically, we reformulate the dataset condensation objective into a novel class-adaptive cluster allocation problem (CCAP), which eliminates costly training and integrates adaptive label allocation to handle class imbalance. To solve the NP-hard CCAP, we develop HFILS, a heuristic local search that alternates between soft allocation and class-wise clustering to efficiently obtain high-quality solutions. Moreover, a hybrid categorical feature encoding (HCFE) is proposed for semantics-preserving clustering of heterogeneous discrete attributes. Extensive experiments on 10 real-world datasets demonstrate that C$^{2}$TC improves efficiency by at least 2 orders of magnitude over state-of-the-art baselines, while achieving superior downstream performance.",

    "abstract": "Rapid advances in AI-generated image (AIGI) technology enable highly realistic synthesis, threatening public information integrity and security. Recent studies have demonstrated that incorporating texture-level artifact features alongside semantic features into multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can enhance their AIGI detection capability. However, our preliminary analyses reveal that artifact features exhibit high intra-feature similarity, leading to an almost uniform attention map after the softmax operation. This phenomenon causes attention dilution, thereby hindering effective fusion between semantic and artifact features. To overcome this limitation, we propose a lightweight fusion adapter, TranX-Adapter, which integrates a Task-aware Optimal-Transport Fusion that leverages the Jensen-Shannon divergence between artifact and semantic prediction probabilities as a cost matrix to transfer artifact information into semantic features, and an X-Fusion that employs cross-attention to transfer semantic information into artifact features. Experiments on standard AIGI detection benchmarks upon several advanced MLLMs, show that our TranX-Adapter brings consistent and significant improvements (up to +6% accuracy).",

    "abstract": "The growing integration of distributed photovoltaics (PVs) into active distribution networks (ADNs) has exacerbated operational challenges, making it imperative to coordinate diverse equipment to mitigate voltage violations and enhance power quality. Although existing data-driven approaches have demonstrated effectiveness in the voltage control problem, they often require extensive trial-and-error exploration and struggle to incorporate heterogeneous information, such as day-ahead forecasts and semantic-based grid codes. Considering the operational scenarios and requirements in real-world ADNs, in this paper, we propose a hybrid knowledge-data-driven approach that leverages dynamic collaboration between a large language model (LLM) agent and a reinforcement learning (RL) agent to achieve two-stage voltage control. In the day-ahead stage, the LLM agent receives coarse region-level forecasts and generates scheduling strategies for on-load tap changer (OLTC) and shunt capacitors (SCs) to regulate the overall voltage profile. Then in the intra-day stage, based on accurate node-level measurements, the RL agent refines terminal voltages by deriving reactive power generation strategies for PV inverters. On top of the LLM-RL collaboration framework, we further propose a self-evolution mechanism for the LLM agent and a pretrain-finetune pipeline for the RL agent, effectively enhancing and coordinating the policies for both agents. The proposed approach not only aligns more closely with practical operational characteristics but also effectively utilizes the inherent knowledge and reasoning capabilities of the LLM agent, significantly improving training efficiency and voltage control performance. Comprehensive comparisons and ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

    "abstract": "Tooth image segmentation is a cornerstone of dental digitization. However, traditional image encoders relying on fixed-resolution feature maps often lead to discontinuous segmentation and poor discrimination between target regions and background, due to insufficient modeling of environmental and global context. Moreover, transformer-based self-attention introduces substantial computational overhead because of its quadratic complexity (O(n^2)), making it inefficient for high-resolution dental images. To address these challenges, we introduce a three-stage encoder with hierarchical feature representation to capture scale-adaptive information in dental images. By jointly leveraging low-level details and high-level semantics through cross-scale feature fusion, the model effectively preserves fine structural information while maintaining strong contextual awareness. Furthermore, a bidirectional sequence modeling strategy is incorporated to enhance global spatial context understanding without incurring high computational cost.   We validate our method on two dental datasets, with experimental results demonstrating its superiority over existing approaches. On the OralVision dataset, our model achieves a 1.1% improvement in mean intersection over union (mIoU).",

    "abstract": "Accurate forest stand delineation is essential for forest inventory and management but remains a largely manual and subjective process. A recent study has shown that deep learning can produce stand delineations comparable to expert interpreters when combining aerial imagery and airborne laser scanning (ALS) data. However, temporal misalignment between data sources limits operational scalability. Canopy height models (CHMs) derived from digital photogrammetry (DAP) offer better temporal alignment but may smoothen canopy surface and canopy gaps, raising the question of whether they can reliably replace ALS-derived CHMs. Similarly, the inclusion of a digital terrain model (DTM) has been suggested to improve delineation performance, but has remained untested in published literature. Using expert-delineated forest stands as reference data, we assessed a U-Net-based semantic segmentation framework with municipality-level cross-validation across six municipalities in southeastern Norway. We compared multispectral aerial imagery combined with (i) an ALS-derived CHM, (ii) a DAP-derived CHM, and (iii) a DAP-derived CHM in combination with a DTM. Results showed comparable performance across all data combinations, reaching overall accuracy values between 0.90-0.91. Agreement between model predictions was substantially larger than agreement with the reference data, highlighting both model consistency and the inherent subjectivity of stand delineation. The similar performance of DAP-CHMs, despite the reduced structural detail, and the lack of improvements of the DTM indicate that the framework is resilient to variations in input data. These findings indicate that large datasets for deep learning-based stand delineations can be assembled using projects including temporally aligned ALS data and DAP point clouds.",

By means of improved network design and dedicated training strategies, we extend the method to achieve filter-permutation invariance as well as the possibility to change the convolutional dictionary at inference time. We apply our method to low-field MRI and compare it to several other recent deep learning-based methods, also on in vivo data, in which the benefit for the use of a different dictionary is showcased. We further assess the method's robustness when tested on in- and out-of-distribution data. When tested on the latter, the proposed method suffers less from the data distribution shift compared to the other learned methods, which we attribute to its reduced reliance on training data due to its underlying model-based reconstruction component.",

We introduce ResGo, a benchmark of laparoscopic frames annotated with Go Zone bounding boxes and clinician-authored rationales covering phase, exposure quality reasoning, next action and risk reminder. We introduce evaluation metrics that treat correct grounding under incorrect phase as failures, revealing that most vision-language models cannot handle such tasks and perform poorly. We then present SurGo-R1, a model optimized via RLHF with a multi-turn phase-then-go architecture where the model first identifies the surgical phase, then generates reasoning and Go Zone coordinates conditioned on that context.

Based on these observations, we propose Dynamic Multimodal Activation Steering, a training-free approach for hallucination mitigation. Our method constructs a semantic-based truthfulness steering vector database and computes visual perception steering vectors, enabling context-aware interventions during inference by dynamically selecting the most relevant steering vectors based on input semantic similarity and applying them to the most influential attention heads.

    "title": "Learning Complex Physical Regimes via Coverage-oriented Uncertainty Quantification: An application to the Critical Heat Flux",
    "abstract": "A central challenge in scientific machine learning (ML) is the correct representation of physical systems governed by multi-regime behaviours. In these scenarios, standard data analysis techniques often fail to capture the nature of the data, as the system's response varies significantly across the state space due to its stochasticity and the different physical regimes. Uncertainty quantification (UQ) should thus not be viewed merely as a safety assessment, but as a support to the learning task itself, guiding the model to internalise the behaviour of the data. We address this by focusing on the Critical Heat Flux (CHF) benchmark and dataset presented by the OECD/NEA Expert Group on Reactor Systems Multi-Physics. This case study represents a test for scientific ML due to the non-linear dependence of CHF on the inputs and the existence of distinct microscopic physical regimes. These regimes exhibit diverse statistical profiles, a complexity that requires UQ techniques to internalise the data behaviour and ensure reliable predictions. In this work, we conduct a comparative analysis of UQ methodologies to determine their impact on physical representation. We contrast post-hoc methods, specifically conformal prediction, against end-to-end coverage-oriented pipelines, including (Bayesian) heteroscedastic regression and quality-driven losses. These approaches treat uncertainty not as a final metric, but as an active component of the optimisation process, modelling the prediction and its behaviour simultaneously. We show that while post-hoc methods ensure statistical calibration, coverage-oriented learning effectively reshapes the model's representation to match the complex physical regimes. The result is a model that delivers not only high predictive accuracy but also a physically consistent uncertainty estimation that adapts dynamically to the intrinsic variability of the CHF.",

    "title": "Maximal Biclique Enumeration with Improved Worst-Case Time Complexity Guarantee: A Partition-Oriented Strategy",
    "abstract": "The maximal biclique enumeration problem in bipartite graphs is fundamental and has numerous applications in E-commerce and transaction networks. Most existing studies adopt a branch-and-bound framework, which recursively expands a partial biclique with a vertex until no further vertices can be added. Equipped with a basic pivot selection strategy, all state-of-the-art methods have a worst-case time complexity no better than $O(m\\cdot (\\sqrt{2})^n)$}, where $m$ and $n$ are the number of edges and vertices in the graph, respectively. In this paper, we introduce a new branch-and-bound (BB) algorithm \\texttt{IPS}. In \\texttt{IPS}, we relax the strict stopping criterion of existing methods by allowing termination when all maximal bicliques within the current branch can be outputted in the time proportional to the number of maximal bicliques inside, reducing the total number of branches required. Second, to fully unleash the power of the new termination condition, we propose an improved pivot selection strategy, which well aligns with the new termination condition to achieve better theoretical and practical performance. Formally, \\texttt{IPS} improves the worst-case time complexity to $O(m\\cdot α^n + n\\cdot β)$, where $α(\\approx 1.3954)$ is the largest positive root of $x^4-2x-1=0$ and $β$ represents the number of maximal bicliques in the graph, respectively. This result surpasses that of all existing algorithms given that $α$ is strictly smaller than $\\sqrt{2}$ and $β$ is at most $(\\sqrt{2})^n-2$ theoretically. Furthermore, we apply an inclusion-exclusion-based framework to boost the performance of \\texttt{IPS}, improving the worst-case time complexity to $O(n\\cdot γ^2\\cdotα^γ+ γ\\cdot β)$ for large sparse graphs ($γ$ is a parameter satisfying $γ\\ll n$ for sparse graphs).",

    "abstract": "Scene flow estimation is an extremely important task in computer vision to support the perception of dynamic changes in the scene. For robust scene flow, learning-based approaches have recently achieved impressive results using either image-based or LiDAR-based modalities. However, these methods have tended to focus on the use of a single modality. To tackle these problems, we present a deep learning architecture, SF3D-RGB, that enables sparse scene flow estimation using 2D monocular images and 3D point clouds (e.g., acquired by LiDAR) as inputs. Our architecture is an end-to-end model that first encodes information from each modality into features and fuses them together. Then, the fused features enhance a graph matching module for better and more robust mapping matrix computation to generate an initial scene flow. Finally, a residual scene flow module further refines the initial scene flow. Our model is designed to strike a balance between accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, experiments show that our proposed method outperforms single-modality methods and achieves better scene flow accuracy on real-world datasets while using fewer parameters compared to other state-of-the-art methods with fusion.",

    "abstract": "Generative AI is widely used to create commercial posters. However, rapid advances in generation have outpaced automated quality assessment. Existing models emphasize generic esthetics or low level distortions and lack the functional criteria required for e-commerce design. It is especially challenging for Chinese content, where complex characters often produce subtle but critical textual artifacts that are overlooked by existing methods. To address this, we introduce E-comIQ-ZH, a framework for evaluating Chinese e-commerce posters. We build the first dataset E-comIQ-18k to feature multi dimensional scores and expert calibrated Chain of Thought (CoT) rationales. Using this dataset, we train E-comIQ-M, a specialized evaluation model that aligns with human expert judgment. Our framework enables E-comIQ-Bench, the first automated and scalable benchmark for the generation of Chinese e-commerce posters. Extensive experiments show our E-comIQ-M aligns more closely with expert standards and enables scalable automated assessment of e-commerce posters.

    "title": "EditFlow: Benchmarking and Optimizing Code Edit Recommendation Systems via Reconstruction of Developer Flows",
    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) for code editing have achieved remarkable progress, yet recent empirical studies reveal a fundamental disconnect between technical accuracy and developer productivity. Despite their strong benchmark performance, developers complete tasks 19% slower when using AI assistance, with over 68.81% of recommendations disrupting their mental flow. This misalignment stems from the use of static commit snapshots that lack temporal information, causing models to optimize for end results rather than the incremental, context-sensitive steps that align with developers' natural reasoning process.   To bridge this gap, we present EditFlow, which benchmarks and optimizes subsequent code edit recommendation systems through the reconstruction of developer editing flows. EditFlow addresses three key challenges. First, collecting edit-order data that reflects developers' flow is inherently difficult: manual annotation introduces prohibitive overhead, while development logs capture only single trajectories instead of all plausible editing flows. Second, benchmarking recommendation performance against developers' ongoing editing flow requires a digital-twin-like simulation that can faithfully simulate the editing process. Third, existing heterogeneous systems vary drastically in scale and architecture, posing challenges for developing a unified optimization strategy that endows all models with mental-flow awareness regardless of design or capability.   ......",

    "title": "Dual-Regime Hybrid Aerodynamic Modeling of Winged Blimps With Neural Mixing",
    "abstract": "Winged blimps operate across distinct aerodynamic regimes that cannot be adequately captured by a single model. At high speeds and small angles of attack, their dynamics exhibit strong coupling between lift and attitude, resembling fixed-wing aircraft behavior. At low speeds or large angles of attack, viscous effects and flow separation dominate, leading to drag-driven and damping-dominated dynamics. Accurately representing transitions between these regimes remains a fundamental challenge. This paper presents a hybrid aerodynamic modeling framework that integrates a fixed-wing Aerodynamic Coupling Model (ACM) and a Generalized Drag Model (GDM) using a learned neural network mixer with explicit physics-based regularization. The mixer enables smooth transitions between regimes while retaining explicit, physics-based aerodynamic representation. Model parameters are identified through a structured three-phase pipeline tailored for hybrid aerodynamic modeling. The proposed approach is validated on the RGBlimp platform through a large-scale experimental campaign comprising 1,320 real-world flight trajectories across 330 thruster and moving mass configurations, spanning a wide range of speeds and angles of attack. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid model consistently outperforms single-model and predefined-mixer baselines, establishing a practical and robust aerodynamic modeling solution for winged blimps.",

    "abstract": "Multimodal time series forecasting has garnered significant attention for its potential to provide more accurate predictions than traditional single-modality models by leveraging rich information inherent in other modalities. However, due to fundamental challenges in modality alignment, existing methods often struggle to effectively incorporate multimodal data into predictions, particularly textual information that has a causal influence on time series fluctuations, such as emergency reports and policy announcements. In this paper, we reflect on the role of textual information in numerical forecasting and propose Time series transformers with Multimodal Mixture-of-Experts, TiMi, to unleash the causal reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Concretely, TiMi utilizes LLMs to generate inferences on future developments, which serve as guidance for time series forecasting. To seamlessly integrate both exogenous factors and time series into predictions, we introduce a Multimodal Mixture-of-Experts (MMoE) module as a lightweight plug-in to empower Transformer-based time series models for multimodal forecasting, eliminating the need for explicit representation-level alignment. Experimentally, our proposed TiMi demonstrates consistent state-of-the-art performance on sixteen real-world multimodal forecasting benchmarks, outperforming advanced baselines while offering both strong adaptability and interpretability.",

    "abstract": "Trajectory generation for visually impaired scenarios requires smooth and temporally consistent state in structured, low-speed dynamic environments. However, traditional jerk-based heuristic trajectory sampling with independent segment generation and conventional smoothness penalties often lead to unstable terminal behavior and state discontinuities under frequent regenerating. This paper proposes a trajectory generation approach that integrates endpoint regulation to stabilize terminal states within each segment and momentum-aware dynamics to regularize the evolution of velocity and acceleration for segment consistency. Endpoint regulation is incorporated into trajectory sampling to stabilize terminal behavior, while a momentum-aware dynamics enforces consistent velocity and acceleration evolution across consecutive trajectory segments. Experimental results demonstrate reduced acceleration peaks and lower jerk levels with decreased dispersion, smoother velocity and acceleration profiles, more stable endpoint distributions, and fewer infeasible trajectory candidates compared with a baseline planner.",

    "abstract": "Self-attention is usually described as a flexible, content-adaptive way to mix a token with information from its past. We re-interpret causal self-attention transformers, the backbone of modern foundation models, within a probabilistic framework, much like how classical PCA is extended to probabilistic PCA. However, this re-formulation reveals a surprising and deeper structural insight: due to a change-of-variables phenomenon, a barrier constraint emerges on the self-attention parameters. This induces a highly structured geometry on the token space, providing theoretical insights into the dynamics of LLM decoding. This reveals a boundary where attention becomes ill-conditioned, leading to a margin interpretation similar to classical support vector machines. Just like support vectors, this naturally gives rise to the concept of support tokens.   Furthermore, we show that LLMs can be interpreted as a stochastic process over the power set of the token space, providing a rigorous probabilistic framework for sequence modeling. We propose a Bayesian framework and derive a MAP estimation objective that requires only a minimal modification to standard LLM training: the addition of a smooth log-barrier penalty to the usual cross-entropy loss. We demonstrate that this provides more robust models without sacrificing out-of-sample accuracy and that it is straightforward to incorporate in practice.",

We want to ensure that all players feel that they have been treated fairly, not only after the last day, but after every single day. We present two 'balance' conditions on sequences of permutations. One condition can always be satisfied, but is arguably too weak; a second condition is strong, and can be satisfied for all n <= 11, but cannot be satisfied for some larger values of n, including all n>61.   We then relate the 'balance' condition to the requirement that the cumulative assignment is proportional up to one item (PROP1), where proportionality holds in a strong ordinal sense -- for every valuations that are consistent with the item ranking. We present a third balance condition that implies ordinal PROP1. We show that a sequence guaranteeing this balance condition exists for all n <= 12, but might not exist when n=6k for any k >= 19.   Finally, we present a fourth, weaker balance condition on a sequence, that guarantees ordinal proportionality up to two items (PROP2).

Our findings reveal that, beyond those external concerns, women also hold self-imposed standards regarding what feels appropriate and worthwhile to share publicly. We further show how interactions with LLMs help women meet these standards and navigate such concerns. We conclude by discussing how LLMs might be carefully and critically leveraged to support women's everyday expression online.",

    "abstract": "Multi-modal distribution in robotic manipulation action sequences poses critical challenges for imitation learning. To this end, existing approaches often model the action space as either a discrete set of tokens or a continuous, latent-variable distribution. However, both approaches present trade-offs: some methods discretize actions into tokens and therefore lose fine-grained action variations, while others generate continuous actions in a single stage tend to produce unstable mode transitions. To address these limitations, we propose Primary-Fine Decoupling for Action Generation (PF-DAG), a two-stage framework that decouples coarse action consistency from fine-grained variations. First, we compress action chunks into a small set of discrete modes, enabling a lightweight policy to select consistent coarse modes and avoid mode bouncing. Second, a mode conditioned MeanFlow policy is learned to generate high-fidelity continuous actions. Theoretically, we prove PF-DAG's two-stage design achieves a strictly lower MSE bound than single-stage generative policies. Empirically, PF-DAG outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across 56 tasks from Adroit, DexArt, and MetaWorld benchmarks. It further generalizes to real-world tactile dexterous manipulation tasks. Our work demonstrates that explicit mode-level decoupling enables both robust multi-modal modeling and reactive closed-loop control for robotic manipulation.",

    "abstract": "Autonomous parking fundamentally differs from on-road driving due to its frequent direction changes and complex maneuvering requirements. However, existing End-to-End (E2E) planning methods often simplify the parking task into a geometric path regression problem, neglecting explicit modeling of the vehicle's kinematic state. This \"dimensionality deficiency\" easily leads to physically infeasible trajectories and deviates from real human driving behavior, particularly at critical gear-shift points in multi-shot parking scenarios. In this paper, we propose SunnyParking, a novel dual-branch E2E architecture that achieves motion state awareness by jointly predicting spatial trajectories and discrete motion state sequences (e.g., forward/reverse). Additionally, we introduce a Fourier feature-based representation of target parking slots to overcome the resolution limitations of traditional bird's-eye view (BEV) approaches, enabling high-precision target interactions. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework generates more robust and human-like trajectories in complex multi-shot parking scenarios, while significantly improving gear-shift point localization accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. We open-source a new parking dataset of the CARLA simulator, specifically designed to evaluate full prediction capabilities under complex maneuvers.",

    "title": "Trie-Aware Transformers for Generative Recommendation",
    "abstract": "Generative recommendation (GR) aligns with advances in generative AI by casting next-item prediction as token-level generation rather than score-based ranking. Most GR methods adopt a two-stage pipeline: (i) \\textit{item tokenization}, which maps each item to a sequence of discrete, hierarchically organized tokens; and (ii) \\textit{autoregressive generation}, which predicts the next item's tokens conditioned on the tokens of user's interaction history. Although hierarchical tokenization induces a prefix tree (trie) over items, standard autoregressive modeling with conventional Transformers often flattens item tokens into a linear stream and overlooks the underlying topology.   To address this, we propose TrieRec, a trie-aware generative recommendation method that augments Transformers with structural inductive biases via two positional encodings. First, a \\textit{trie-aware absolute positional encoding} aggregates a token's (node's) local structural context (\\eg depth, ancestors, and descendants) into the token representation. Second, a \\textit{topology-aware relative positional encoding} injects pairwise structural relations into self-attention to capture topology-induced semantic relatedness. TrieRec is also model-agnostic, efficient, and hyperparameter-free. In our experiments, we implement TrieRec within three representative GR backbones, achieving notably improvements of 8.83\\% on average across four real-world datasets.",

    "abstract": "Active automata learning (AAL) algorithms can learn a behavioral model of a system from interacting with it. The primary challenge remains scaling to larger models, in particular in the presence of many possible inputs to the system. Modern AAL algorithms fail to scale even if, in every state, most inputs lead to errors. In various challenging problems from the literature, these errors are observable, i.e., they emit a known error output. Motivated by these problems, we study learning these systems more efficiently. Further, we consider various degrees of knowledge about which inputs are non-error producing at which state. For each level of knowledge, we provide a matching adaptation of the state-of-the-art AAL algorithm L# to make the most of this domain knowledge. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that the methods accelerate learning by orders of magnitude with strong but realistic domain knowledge to a single order of magnitude with limited domain knowledge.",

    "abstract": "The sixth generation (6G) network is expected to deploy larger multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) arrays to support massive connectivity, which will increase overhead and latency at the physical layer. Meanwhile, emerging 6G demands such as immersive communications and environmental sensing pose challenges to traditional signal processing. To address these issues, we propose the ``semantic-aware MIMO'' paradigm, which leverages specialist models and large models to perceive, utilize, and fuse the inherent semantics of channels and sources for improved performance. Moreover, for representative MIMO physical-layer tasks, e.g., random access activity detection, channel feedback, and precoding, we design specialist models that exploit channel and source semantics for better performance. Additionally, in view of the more diversified functions of 6G MIMO, we further explore large models as a scalable solution for multi-task semantic-aware MIMO and review recent advances along with their advantages and limitations. Finally, we discuss the challenges, insights, and prospects of the evolution of specialist models and large models empowered semantic-aware MIMO paradigms.",

    "abstract": "Multi-robot task planning requires decomposing natural-language instructions into executable actions for heterogeneous robot teams. Conventional Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) planners provide rigorous guarantees but struggle to handle ambiguous or long-horizon missions, while large language models (LLMs) can interpret instructions and propose plans but may hallucinate or produce infeasible actions. We present a hierarchical multi-agent LLM-based planner with prompt optimization: an upper layer decomposes tasks and assigns them to lower-layer agents, which generate PDDL problems solved by a classical planner. When plans fail, the system applies TextGrad-inspired textual-gradient updates to optimize each agent's prompt and thereby improve planning accuracy. In addition, meta-prompts are learned and shared across agents within the same layer, enabling efficient prompt optimization in multi-agent settings. On the MAT-THOR benchmark, our planner achieves success rates of 0.95 on compound tasks, 0.84 on complex tasks, and 0.60 on vague tasks, improving over the previous state-of-the-art LaMMA-P by 2, 7, and 15 percentage points respectively. An ablation study shows that the hierarchical structure, prompt optimization, and meta-prompt sharing contribute roughly +59, +37, and +4 percentage points to the overall success rate.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge Distillation (KD) has emerged as a crucial technique for compressing Large Language Models (LLMs). Although existing cross-tokenizer KD methods have made notable progress, their effectiveness remains constrained by suboptimal alignment across sequence and vocabulary levels. To address these limitations, we introduce Dual-Space Weighting and Time-Warped Alignment (DWA-KD), a novel cross-tokenizer distillation framework that enhances token-wise distillation through dual-space entropy-based weighting and achieves precise sequence-level alignment by leveraging both lexical and semantic information. At the token level, DWA-KD maps teacher representations into the student space and vice versa, performing dual-space KD via Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL). The process is modulated by dual-space weights that up-weight tokens where the student is uncertain and the teacher is confident, thereby focusing learning on informative tokens rather than treating all positions equally. At the sequence level, DWA-KD applies Soft Dynamic Time Warping (Soft-DTW) to both the embedding and final hidden-state layers, enabling robust alignment of lexical and contextual semantics between teacher and student sequences. Extensive experiments across diverse NLP benchmarks demonstrate that DWA-KD outperforms state-of-the-art KD baselines, while ablation studies confirm the complementary contributions of entropy-based token weighting and embedding and final hidden state layer Soft-DTW alignment.",

    "abstract": "Forecasting dynamic scenes remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision, as limited observations make it difficult to capture coherent object-level motion and long-term temporal evolution. We present Motion Group-aware Gaussian Forecasting (MoGaF), a framework for long-term scene extrapolation built upon the 4D Gaussian Splatting representation. MoGaF introduces motion-aware Gaussian grouping and group-wise optimization to enforce physically consistent motion across both rigid and non-rigid regions, yielding spatially coherent dynamic representations. Leveraging this structured space-time representation, a lightweight forecasting module predicts future motion, enabling realistic and temporally stable scene evolution. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that MoGaF consistently outperforms existing baselines in rendering quality, motion plausibility, and long-term forecasting stability.

However, existing approaches struggle to achieve high accuracy under strict bandwidth constraints and remain highly vulnerable to random transmission packet loss. We introduce QPoint2Comm, a quantized point-cloud communication framework that dramatically reduces bandwidth while preserving high-fidelity 3D information. Instead of transmitting intermediate features, QPoint2Comm directly communicates quantized point-cloud indices using a shared codebook, enabling efficient reconstruction with lower bandwidth than feature-based methods. To ensure robustness to possible communication packet loss, we employ a masked training strategy that simulates random packet loss, allowing the model to maintain strong performance even under severe transmission failures. In addition, a cascade attention fusion module is proposed to enhance multi-vehicle information integration. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that QPoint2Comm sets a new state of the art in accuracy, communication efficiency, and resilience to packet loss.",

    "abstract": "It remains challenging to achieve human-like locomotion in legged robots due to fundamental discrepancies between biological and mechanical structures. Although imitation learning has emerged as a promising approach for generating natural robotic movements, simply replicating joint angle trajectories fails to capture the underlying principles of human motion. This study proposes a Gait Divergence Analysis Framework (GDAF), a unified biomechanical evaluation framework that systematically quantifies kinematic and kinetic discrepancies between humans and bipedal robots. We apply GDAF to systematically compare human and humanoid locomotion across 28 walking speeds. To enable reproducible analysis, we collect and release a speed-continuous humanoid locomotion dataset from a state-of-the-art humanoid controller. We further provide an open-source implementation of GDAF, including analysis, visualization, and MuJoCo-based tools, enabling quantitative, interpretable, and reproducible biomechanical analysis of humanoid locomotion. Results demonstrate that despite visually human-like motion generated by modern humanoid controllers, significant biomechanical divergence persists across speeds. Robots exhibit systematic deviations in gait symmetry, energy distribution, and joint coordination, indicating that substantial room remains for improving the biomechanical fidelity and energetic efficiency of humanoid locomotion. This work provides a quantitative benchmark for evaluating humanoid locomotion and offers data and versatile tools to support the development of more human-like and energetically efficient locomotion controllers. The data and code will be made publicly available upon acceptance of the paper.",

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without sharing raw data. However, shared local model updates remain vulnerable to inference and poisoning attacks. Secure aggregation schemes have been proposed to mitigate these attacks. In this work, we aim to understand how these techniques are implemented in quantum-assisted FL. Quantum Secure Aggregation (QSA) has been proposed, offering information-theoretic privacy by encoding client updates into the global phase of multipartite entangled states. Existing QSA protocols, however, rely on a single global Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state shared among all participating clients. This design poses fundamental challenges: fidelity of large-scale GHZ states deteriorates rapidly with the increasing number of clients; and (ii) the global aggregation prevents the detection of Byzantine clients. We propose Clustered Quantum Secure Aggregation (CQSA), a modular aggregation framework that reconciles the physical constraints of near-term quantum hardware along with the need for Byzantine-robustness in FL. CQSA randomly partitions the clients into small clusters, each performing local quantum aggregation using high-fidelity, low-qubit GHZ states. The server analyzes statistical relationships between cluster-level aggregates employing common statistical measures such as cosine similarity and Euclidean distance to identify malicious contributions. Through theoretical analysis and simulations under depolarizing noise, we demonstrate that CQSA ensures stable model convergence, achieves superior state fidelity over global QSA.",

    "abstract": "Learning-based point cloud compression presents superior performance to handcrafted codecs. However, pretrained-based methods, which are based on end-to-end training and expected to generalize to all the potential samples, suffer from training data dependency. Implicit neural representation (INR) based methods are distribution-agnostic and more robust, but they require time-consuming online training and suffer from the bitstream overhead from the overfitted model. To address these limitations, we propose HybridINR-PCGC, a novel hybrid framework that bridges the pretrained model and INR. Our framework retains distribution-agnostic properties while leveraging a pretrained network to accelerate convergence and reduce model overhead, which consists of two parts: the Pretrained Prior Network (PPN) and the Distribution Agnostic Refiner (DAR). We leverage the PPN, designed for fast inference and stable performance, to generate a robust prior for accelerating the DAR's convergence. The DAR is decomposed into a base layer and an enhancement layer, and only the enhancement layer needed to be packed into the bitstream. Finally, we propose a supervised model compression module to further supervise and minimize the bitrate of the enhancement layer parameters. Based on experiment results, HybridINR-PCGC achieves a significantly improved compression rate and encoding efficiency. Specifically, our method achieves a Bpp reduction of approximately 20.43% compared to G-PCC on 8iVFB. In the challenging out-of-distribution scenario Cat1B, our method achieves a Bpp reduction of approximately 57.85% compared to UniPCGC. And our method exhibits a superior time-rate trade-off, achieving an average Bpp reduction of 15.193% relative to the LINR-PCGC on 8iVFB.",

    "abstract": "Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) has significantly advanced automated chest X-ray diagnosis but remains isolated from clinical workflows and lacks reliable decision support and interpretability. Human-AI collaboration seeks to enhance the reliability of diagnostic models by integrating the behaviors of controllable radiologists. However, the absence of interactive tools seamlessly embedded within diagnostic routines impedes collaboration, while the semantic gap between radiologists' decision-making patterns and model representations further limits clinical adoption. To overcome these limitations, we propose a visual cognition-guided collaborative network (VCC-Net) to achieve the cooperative diagnostic paradigm. VCC-Net centers on visual cognition (VC) and employs clinically compatible interfaces, such as eye-tracking or the mouse, to capture radiologists' visual search traces and attention patterns during diagnosis. VCC-Net employs VC as a spatial cognition guide, learning hierarchical visual search strategies to localize diagnostically key regions. A cognition-graph co-editing module subsequently integrates radiologist VC with model inference to construct a disease-aware graph. The module captures dependencies among anatomical regions and aligns model representations with VC-driven features, mitigating radiologist bias and facilitating complementary, transparent decision-making. Experiments on the public datasets SIIM-ACR, EGD-CXR, and self-constructed TB-Mouse dataset achieved classification accuracies of 88.40%, 85.05%, and 92.41%, respectively. The attention maps produced by VCC-Net exhibit strong concordance with radiologists' gaze distributions, demonstrating a mutual reinforcement of radiologist and model inference.

Because human annotations reflect subjective preferences and expertise, ground-truth captions are often incomplete or even incorrect, which in turn limits caption models. We argue that caption quality should be assessed by two objective aspects: completeness (does the caption cover all salient visual facts?) and correctness (are the descriptions true with respect to the image?). To this end, we introduce CCCaption: a dual-reward reinforcement learning framework with a dedicated fine-tuning corpus that explicitly optimizes these properties to generate \\textbf{C}omplete and \\textbf{C}orrect \\textbf{Captions}. For completeness, we use diverse LVLMs to disentangle the image into a set of visual queries, and reward captions that answer more of these queries, with a dynamic query sampling strategy to improve training efficiency. For correctness, we penalize captions that contain hallucinations by validating the authenticity of sub-caption queries, which are derived from the caption decomposition. Our symmetric dual-reward optimization jointly maximizes completeness and correctness, guiding models toward captions that better satisfy these objective criteria. Extensive experiments across standard captioning benchmarks show consistent improvements, offering a principled path to training caption models beyond human-annotation imitation.",

    "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly shifted from peripheral assistive tools to constant companions in everyday and even high stakes human decision making. Many users now consult these models about health, intimate relationships, finance, education, and identity, because LLMs are, in practice, multi domain, inexpensive, always available, and seemingly nonjudgmental. At the same time, from a technical perspective these models rely on transformer architectures, exhibit highly unpredictable behavior in detail, and are fundamentally stateless; conceptually, they lack any real subjectivity, intention, or responsibility. This article argues that the combination of this technical architecture with the social position of LLMs as multis pecialist counselors in an age of human loneliness produces a new kind of advisory intimacy without a subject. In this new relation, model outputs are experienced as if they contained deep understanding, neutrality, emotional support, and user level control, while at the deeper level there is no human agent who is straightforwardly responsible or answerable. By reviewing dominant strands of AI ethics critique, we show that focusing only on developer liability, data bias, or emotional attachment to chatbots is insufficient to capture this configuration. We then explore the ethical and political implications of this advisory intimacy without a subject for policy-making, for justice in access to counseling, and for how we understand loneliness in the contemporary world.",

Post-training sparsity (PTS), which reduces model cost by removing weights from dense networks, is an effective approach. However, native dense matrices lack high sparsity, making existing approaches that directly remove weights disrupt model states, resulting in unsatisfactory performance recovery even with post-tuning. We propose Sparsity Induction, which promotes models toward higher sparsity at both distribution and feature levels before pruning, to push the limits of PTS. At the distribution level, we enhance distributional sparsity through mathematically equivalent scaling transformations, which are fully absorbable and incur no extra parameters or inference-time overhead. At the feature level, we introduce Spectral Norm Loss to promote feature sparsity from a low-rank perspective. Experiments across diverse model architectures and tasks demonstrate that our method further enhances sparsity-friendliness, achieving superior pruning performance over existing approaches.",

    "abstract": "Public policy decisions are typically justified using a narrow set of headline indicators, leaving many downstream social impacts unstructured and difficult to compare across policies. We propose PPCR-IM, a system for multi-layer DAG-based consequence reasoning and social indicator mapping that addresses this gap. Given a policy description and its context, PPCR-IM uses an LLM-driven, layer-wise generator to construct a directed acyclic graph of intermediate consequences, allowing child nodes to have multiple parents to capture joint influences. A mapping module then aligns these nodes to a fixed indicator set and assigns one of three qualitative impact directions: increase, decrease, or ambiguous change. For each policy episode, the system outputs a structured record containing the DAG, indicator mappings, and three evaluation measures: an expected-indicator coverage score, a discovery rate for overlooked but relevant indicators, and a relative focus ratio comparing the systems coverage to that of the government. PPCR-IM is available both as an online demo and as a configurable XLSX-to-JSON batch pipeline.",

    "title": "Multimodal Survival Modeling and Fairness-Aware Clinical Machine Learning for 5-Year Breast Cancer Risk Prediction",
    "abstract": "Clinical risk prediction models often underperform in real-world settings due to poor calibration, limited transportability, and subgroup disparities. These challenges are amplified in high-dimensional multimodal cancer datasets characterized by complex feature interactions and a p >> n structure. We present a fully reproducible multimodal machine learning framework for 5-year overall survival prediction in breast cancer, integrating clinical variables with high-dimensional transcriptomic and copy-number alteration (CNA) features from the METABRIC cohort.   After variance- and sparsity-based filtering and dimensionality reduction, models were trained using stratified train/validation/test splits with validation-based hyperparameter tuning. Two survival approaches were compared: an elastic-net regularized Cox model (CoxNet) and a gradient-boosted survival tree model implemented using XGBoost. CoxNet provides embedded feature selection and stable estimation, whereas XGBoost captures nonlinear effects and higher-order interactions.   Performance was assessed using time-dependent area under the ROC curve (AUC), average precision (AP), calibration curves, Brier score, and bootstrapped 95 percent confidence intervals. CoxNet achieved validation and test AUCs of 98.3 and 96.6, with AP values of 90.1 and 80.4. XGBoost achieved validation and test AUCs of 98.6 and 92.5, with AP values of 92.5 and 79.9. Fairness diagnostics showed stable discrimination across age groups, estrogen receptor status, molecular subtypes, and menopausal state.   This work introduces a governance-oriented multimodal survival framework emphasizing calibration, fairness auditing, robustness, and reproducibility for high-dimensional clinical machine learning.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents and evaluates an optimized cascaded Nepali speech-to-English text translation (S2TT) system, focusing on mitigating structural noise introduced by Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). We first establish highly proficient ASR and NMT components: a Wav2Vec2-XLS-R-300m model achieved a state-of-the-art 2.72% CER on OpenSLR-54, and a multi-stage fine-tuned MarianMT model reached a 28.32 BLEU score on the FLORES-200 benchmark. We empirically investigate the influence of punctuation loss, demonstrating that unpunctuated ASR output significantly degrades translation quality, causing a massive 20.7% relative BLEU drop on the FLORES benchmark. To overcome this, we propose and evaluate an intermediate Punctuation Restoration Module (PRM). The final S2TT pipeline was tested across three configurations on a custom dataset. The optimal configuration, which applied the PRM directly to ASR output, achieved a 4.90 BLEU point gain over the direct ASR-to-NMT baseline (BLEU 36.38 vs. 31.48). This improvement was validated by human assessment, which confirmed the optimized pipeline's superior Adequacy (3.673) and Fluency (3.804). This work validates that targeted punctuation restoration is the most effective intervention for mitigating structural noise in the Nepali S2TT pipeline. It establishes an optimized baseline and demonstrates a critical architectural insight for developing cascaded speech translation systems for similar low-resource languages.",

    "abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved notable success in enhancing translation performance by integrating multimodal information. However, existing research primarily focuses on image-guided methods, whose applicability is constrained by the scarcity of multilingual image-text pairs. The speech modality overcomes this limitation due to its natural alignment with text and the abundance of existing speech datasets, which enable scalable language coverage. In this paper, we propose a Speech-guided Machine Translation (SMT) framework that integrates speech and text as fused inputs into an MLLM to improve translation quality. To mitigate reliance on low-resource data, we introduce a Self-Evolution Mechanism. The core components of this framework include a text-to-speech model, responsible for generating synthetic speech, and an MLLM capable of classifying synthetic speech samples and iteratively optimizing itself using positive samples. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework surpasses all existing methods on the Multi30K multimodal machine translation benchmark, achieving new state-of-the-art results. Furthermore, on general machine translation datasets, particularly the FLORES-200, it achieves average state-of-the-art performance in 108 translation directions. Ablation studies on CoVoST-2 confirms that differences between synthetic and authentic speech have negligible impact on translation quality.

Existing approaches mainly rely on translational displacements, which struggle to represent rotations, articulated transformations, often leading to spatial inconsistency and physically implausible motion. LieFlow, a dynamic radiance representation framework that explicitly models motion within the SE(3) Lie group, enabling coherent learning of translation and rotation in a unified geometric space. The SE(3) transformation field enforces physically inspired constraints to maintain motion continuity and geometric consistency. The evaluation includes a synthetic dataset with rigid-body trajectories and two real-world datasets capturing complex motion under natural lighting and occlusions. Across all datasets, LieFlow consistently improves view-synthesis fidelity, temporal coherence, and physical realism over NeRF-based baselines. These results confirm that SE(3)-based motion modeling offers a robust and physically grounded framework for representing dynamic 4D scenes.",

    "abstract": "Quantization followed by parameter-efficient fine-tuning has emerged as a promising paradigm for downstream adaptation under tight GPU memory constraints. However, this sequential pipeline fails to leverage the intricate interaction between quantization bit-width and LoRA rank. Specifically, a carefully optimized quantization allocation with low quantization error does not always translate to strong fine-tuning performance, and different bit-width and rank configurations can lead to significantly varying outcomes under the same memory budget. To address this limitation, we propose AutoQRA, a joint optimization framework that simultaneously optimizes the bit-width and LoRA rank configuration for each layer during the mixed quantized fine-tuning process. To tackle the challenges posed by the large discrete search space and the high evaluation cost associated with frequent fine-tuning iterations, AutoQRA decomposes the optimization process into two stages. First, it first conducts a global multi-fidelity evolutionary search, where the initial population is warm-started by injecting layer-wise importance priors. This stage employs specific operators and a performance model to efficiently screen candidate configurations. Second, trust-region Bayesian optimization is applied to locally refine promising regions of the search space and identify optimal configurations under the given memory budget. This approach enables active compensation for quantization noise in specific layers during training. Experiments show that AutoQRA achieves performance close to full-precision fine-tuning with a memory footprint comparable to uniform 4-bit methods.",

We present DAGS-SLAM, a dynamic-aware 3DGS-SLAM system that maintains a spatiotemporal motion probability (MP) state per Gaussian and triggers semantics on demand via an uncertainty-aware scheduler. DAGS-SLAM fuses lightweight YOLO instance priors with geometric cues to estimate and temporally update MP, propagates MP to the front-end for dynamic-aware correspondence selection, and suppresses dynamic artifacts in the back-end via MP-guided optimization.

    "abstract": "Uncertainty is inherent in modern engineered systems, including cyber-physical systems, autonomous systems, and large-scale software-intensive infrastructures (such as microservice-based systems) operating in dynamic and partially observable environments. The recent publication of Precise Semantics for Uncertainty Modeling (PSUM) by the Object Management Group represents the first standardized specification for uncertainty modeling within the Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) community, providing formally defined semantics for representing and reasoning about uncertainty in models. In parallel, the second version of Systems Modeling Language (SysML v2) was released as the next-generation systems modeling language, offering improved semantic rigor and reusability, yet lacking native constructs aligned with PSUM for first-class uncertainty representation. This paper proposes a systematic extension of SysML v2 that incorporates the PSUM metamodel into its modeling framework. The extension enables explicit specification of indeterminacy sources, structured characterization of uncertainties, and consistent propagation of uncertainty within system models, while preserving conformance with SysML v2 syntax and semantics. We validate the approach through seven case studies. Results demonstrate that the proposed extension (PSUM-SysMLv2) is expressive and applicable for uncertainty-aware MBSE, and potentially enables uncertainty and uncertainty propagation analyses.",

In that respect, the digital twin concept presents an adequate framework that proffers solution to these challenges. The main purpose of this paper is to develop such a digital twin dedicated to fault detection and diagnosis in the context of a thermal-hydraulic process supervision. Based on a numerical simulation of the system, in addition to machine learning methods, we propose different modules dedicated to process parameter change detection and their on-line estimation. The proposed fault detection and diagnosis algorithm is validated on a specific test scenario, with single one-off parameter change occurrences in the system.

    "abstract": "Effectively addressing client resistance is a sophisticated clinical skill in psychological counseling, yet practitioners often lack timely and scalable supervisory feedback to refine their approaches. Although current NLP research has examined overall counseling quality and general therapeutic skills, it fails to provide granular evaluations of high-stakes moments where clients exhibit resistance. In this work, we present a comprehensive pipeline for the multi-dimensional evaluation of human counselors' interventions specifically targeting client resistance in text-based therapy. We introduce a theory-driven framework that decomposes counselor responses into four distinct communication mechanisms. Leveraging this framework, we curate and share an expert-annotated dataset of real-world counseling excerpts, pairing counselor-client interactions with professional ratings and explanatory rationales. Using this data, we perform full-parameter instruction tuning on a Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct backbone to model fine-grained evaluative judgments of response quality and generate explanations underlying. Experimental results show that our approach can effectively distinguish the quality of different communication mechanisms (77-81% F1), substantially outperforming GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-Sonnet (45-59% F1). Moreover, the model produces high-quality explanations that closely align with expert references and receive near-ceiling ratings from human experts (2.8-2.9/3.0). A controlled experiment with 43 counselors further confirms that receiving these AI-generated feedback significantly improves counselors' ability to respond effectively to client resistance.",

    "abstract": "Foundation models have recently achieved impressive success in computational pathology, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse histopathology tasks. However, existing models overlook the heterogeneous and non-uniform organization of pathological regions of interest (ROIs) because they rely on natural image backbones not tailored for tissue morphology. Consequently, they often fail to capture the coherent tissue architecture beyond isolated patches, limiting interpretability and clinical relevance. To address these challenges, we present Cross-modal Adaptive Region Encoder (CARE), a foundation model for pathology that automatically partitions WSIs into several morphologically relevant regions. Specifically, CARE employs a two-stage pretraining strategy: (1) a self-supervised unimodal pretraining stage that learns morphological representations from 34,277 whole-slide images (WSIs) without segmentation annotations, and (2) a cross-modal alignment stage that leverages RNA and protein profiles to refine the construction and representation of adaptive regions. This molecular guidance enables CARE to identify biologically relevant patterns and generate irregular yet coherent tissue regions, selecting the most representative area as ROI. CARE supports a broad range of pathology-related tasks, using either the ROI feature or the slide-level feature obtained by aggregating adaptive regions. Based on only one-tenth of the pretraining data typically used by mainstream foundation models, CARE achieves superior average performance across 33 downstream benchmarks, including morphological classification, molecular prediction, and survival analysis, and outperforms other foundation model baselines overall.",

    "abstract": "Clinicians commonly interpret three-dimensional (3D) medical images, such as computed tomography (CT) scans, using multiple anatomical planes rather than as a single volumetric representation. In this multi-planar approach, the axial plane typically serves as the primary acquisition and diagnostic reference, while the coronal and sagittal planes provide complementary spatial information to increase diagnostic confidence. However, many existing 3D deep learning methods either process volumetric data holistically or assign equal importance to all planes, failing to reflect the axial-centric clinical interpretation workflow. To address this gap, we propose an axial-centric cross-plane attention architecture for 3D medical image classification that captures the inherent asymmetric dependencies between different anatomical planes. Our architecture incorporates MedDINOv3, a medical vision foundation model pretrained via self-supervised learning on large-scale axial CT images, as a frozen feature extractor for the axial, coronal, and sagittal planes. RICA blocks and intra-plane transformer encoders capture plane-specific positional and contextual information within each anatomical plane, while axial-centric cross-plane transformer encoders condition axial features on complementary information from auxiliary planes. Experimental results on six datasets from the MedMNIST3D benchmark demonstrate that the proposed architecture consistently outperforms existing 3D and multi-plane models in terms of accuracy and AUC. Ablation studies further confirm the importance of axial-centric query-key-value allocation and directional cross-plane fusion. These results highlight the importance of aligning architectural design with clinical interpretation workflows for robust and data-efficient 3D medical image analysis.",

As a result, practitioners often build complex, scenario-specific pipelines and iterate over feature processing, objective design, and tuning. This process is expensive and hard to transfer. We propose AgentLTV, an agent-based unified search-and-evolution framework for automated LTV modeling. AgentLTV treats each candidate solution as an {executable pipeline program}. LLM-driven agents generate code, run and repair pipelines, and analyze execution feedback. Two decision agents coordinate a two-stage search. The Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) stage explores a broad space of modeling choices under a fixed budget, guided by the Polynomial Upper Confidence bounds for Trees criterion and a Pareto-aware multi-metric value function. The Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) stage refines the best MCTS program via island-based evolution with crossover, mutation, and migration. Experiments on a large-scale proprietary dataset and a public benchmark show that AgentLTV consistently discovers strong models across ranking and error metrics. Online bucket-level analysis further indicates improved ranking consistency and value calibration, especially for high-value and negative-LTV segments. We summarize practitioner-oriented takeaways: use MCTS for rapid adaptation to new data patterns, use EA for stable refinement, and validate deployment readiness with bucket-level ranking and calibration diagnostics. The proposed AgentLTV has been successfully deployed online.",

    "abstract": "Standard vision-language-action (VLA) models rely on fitting statistical data priors, limiting their robust understanding of underlying physical dynamics. Reinforcement learning enhances physical grounding through exploration yet typically relies on external reward signals that remain isolated from the agent's internal states. World action models have emerged as a promising paradigm that integrates imagination and control to enable predictive planning. However, they rely on implicit context modeling, lacking explicit mechanisms for self-improvement. To solve these problems, we propose Self-Correcting VLA (SC-VLA), which achieve self-improvement by intrinsically guiding action refinement through sparse imagination. We first design sparse world imagination by integrating auxiliary predictive heads to forecast current task progress and future trajectory trends, thereby constraining the policy to encode short-term physical evolution. Then we introduce the online action refinement module to reshape progress-dependent dense rewards, adjusting trajectory orientation based on the predicted sparse future states. Evaluations on challenging robot manipulation tasks from simulation benchmarks and real-world settings demonstrate that SC-VLA achieve state-of-the-art performance, yielding the highest task throughput with 16% fewer steps and a 9% higher success rate than the best-performing baselines, alongside a 14% gain in real-world experiments.

We provide the first characterization using the classical difference distribution table (DDT): F is PcN if and only if Delta_F(a,b) Delta_F(a,c^{-1}b) = 0 for all nonzero a,b. This enables verification in O(p^{2n}) time given a precomputed DDT, a significant improvement over the naive O(p^{3n}) approach. We prove a strict dichotomy for monomial permutations: the derivative F(x + alpha) - cF(x) is either a permutation for all nonzero shifts or for none, with the general case remaining open. For quadratic permutations, we provide explicit algebraic characterizations. We identify the first class of affine transformations preserving c-differential uniformity and derive tight nonlinearity bounds revealing fundamental incompatibility between PcN and APN properties. These results position perfect c-nonlinearity as a structurally distinct regime within permutation polynomial theory.",

    "abstract": "Hand motion plays a central role in human interaction, yet modeling realistic 4D hand motion (i.e., 3D hand pose sequences over time) remains challenging. Research in this area is typically divided into two tasks: (1) Estimation approaches reconstruct precise motion from visual observations, but often fail under hand occlusion or absence; (2) Generation approaches focus on synthesizing hand poses by exploiting generative priors under multi-modal structured inputs and infilling motion from incomplete sequences. However, this separation not only limits the effective use of heterogeneous condition signals that frequently arise in practice, but also prevents knowledge transfer between the two tasks. We present UniHand, a unified diffusion-based framework that formulates both estimation and generation as conditional motion synthesis. UniHand integrates heterogeneous inputs by embedding structured signals into a shared latent space through a joint variational autoencoder, which aligns conditions such as MANO parameters and 2D skeletons. Visual observations are encoded with a frozen vision backbone, while a dedicated hand perceptron extracts hand-specific cues directly from image features, removing the need for complex detection and cropping pipelines. A latent diffusion model then synthesizes consistent motion sequences from these diverse conditions. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that UniHand delivers robust and accurate hand motion modeling, maintaining performance under severe occlusions and temporally incomplete inputs.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a prevailing paradigm for enhancing reasoning in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, relying solely on outcome supervision risks reward hacking, where models learn spurious reasoning patterns to satisfy final answer checks. While recent rubric-based approaches offer fine-grained supervision signals, they suffer from high computational costs of instance-level generation and inefficient training dynamics caused by treating all rubrics as equally learnable. In this paper, we propose Stratified Rubric-based Curriculum Learning (RuCL), a novel framework that reformulates curriculum learning by shifting the focus from data selection to reward design. RuCL generates generalized rubrics for broad applicability and stratifies them based on the model's competence. By dynamically adjusting rubric weights during training, RuCL guides the model from mastering foundational perception to tackling advanced logical reasoning. Extensive experiments on various visual reasoning benchmarks show that RuCL yields a remarkable +7.83% average improvement over the Qwen2.5-VL-7B model, achieving a state-of-the-art accuracy of 60.06%.",

    "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of tasks, but serving them efficiently at scale remains a critical challenge due to their substantial computational and latency demands. While most existing inference frameworks rely on simple scheduling strategies such as First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) at the engine level and Round-Robin (RR) at the scheduler or coordinator level, they often fail to fully utilize system resources and may suffer from issues such as head-of-line blocking and load imbalance. Recent advances in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have also introduced new challenges in scheduling arising from expert parallelism and routing complexity. This research proposes a multi-layer scheduling framework tailored for MoE-based LLM serving. It targets scheduling at three levels: request-level, enginelevel, and expert-level. At the request level, we explore algorithms such as Shortest-Job-First (SJF) and priority-aware aging to improve throughput and reduce latency. At the engine level, we design load-aware dispatching strategies that account for the current prefix token load, KV cache utilization, and user stickiness to achieve better resource matching. At the expert level, we focus on alleviating expert hotspots and strategically placing inter-layer expert dependencies to balance load and improve routing efficiency. Extensive experimental results from more than 100 experiments conducted under diverse workload distributions show that our approach consistently outperforms the state-of-theart inference framework vLLM, achieving up to 17.8% reduction in Time To First Token (TTFT) latency and 13.3% reduction in Time-Per-Output-Token (TPOT) latency.",

    "abstract": "Vision-Based Tactile Sensors (VBTS) are essential for achieving dexterous robotic manipulation, yet the tactile sim-to-real gap remains a fundamental bottleneck. Current tactile simulations suffer from a persistent dilemma: simplified geometric projections lack physical authenticity, while high-fidelity Finite Element Methods (FEM) are too computationally prohibitive for large-scale reinforcement learning. In this work, we present Tacmap, a high-fidelity, computationally efficient tactile simulation framework anchored in volumetric penetration depth. Our key insight is to bridge the tactile sim-to-real gap by unifying both domains through a shared deform map representation. Specifically, we compute 3D intersection volumes as depth maps in simulation, while in the real world, we employ an automated data-collection rig to learn a robust mapping from raw tactile images to ground-truth depth maps. By aligning simulation and real-world in this unified geometric space, Tacmap minimizes domain shift while maintaining physical consistency. Quantitative evaluations across diverse contact scenarios demonstrate that Tacmap's deform maps closely mirror real-world measurements. Moreover, we validate the utility of Tacmap through an in-hand rotation task, where a policy trained exclusively in simulation achieves zero-shot transfer to a physical robot.",

    "abstract": "Multi-agent robotic manipulation remains challenging due to the combined demands of coordination, grasp stability, and collision avoidance in shared workspaces. To address these challenges, we propose the Adaptive Dynamic Modality Diffusion Policy (ADM-DP), a framework that integrates vision, tactile, and graph-based (multi-agent pose) modalities for coordinated control. ADM-DP introduces four key innovations. First, an enhanced visual encoder merges RGB and point-cloud features via Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) modulation to enrich perception. Second, a tactile-guided grasping strategy uses Force-Sensitive Resistor (FSR) feedback to detect insufficient contact and trigger corrective grasp refinement, improving grasp stability. Third, a graph-based collision encoder leverages shared tool center point (TCP) positions of multiple agents as structured kinematic context to maintain spatial awareness and reduce inter-agent interference. Fourth, an Adaptive Modality Attention Mechanism (AMAM) dynamically re-weights modalities according to task context, enabling flexible fusion. For scalability and modularity, a decoupled training paradigm is employed in which agents learn independent policies while sharing spatial information. This maintains low interdependence between agents while retaining collective awareness. Across seven multi-agent tasks, ADM-DP achieves 12-25% performance gains over state-of-the-art baselines. Ablation studies show the greatest improvements in tasks requiring multiple sensory modalities, validating our adaptive fusion strategy and demonstrating its robustness for diverse manipulation scenarios.",

The game has $n \\ge 2$ players who simultaneously choose prices from the set $\\{1/k, 2/k, \\ldots, 1\\}$, where $k\\in\\mathbb{N}$. The player who sets the lowest price captures the entire demand; if multiple players tie for the lowest price, they split the demand equally.   We study the Bertrand paradox, where classical theory predicts low prices, yet real markets often sustain high prices. To understand this gap, we analyze a repeated-game model in which firms set prices using no-regret learners. Our goal is to characterize the equilibrium outcomes that can arise under different no-regret learning guarantees. We are particularly interested in questions such as whether no-external-regret learners can converge to undesirable high-price outcomes, and how stronger guarantees such as no-swap regret shape the emergence of competitive low-price behavior. We address these and related questions through a theoretical analysis, complemented by experiments that support the theory and reveal surprising phenomena for no-swap regret learners.",

    "abstract": "Visual spatial reasoning (VSR) remains challenging for modern vision-language models (VLMs), despite advances in multimodal architectures. A common strategy is to inject additional information at inference time, such as explicit spatial cues, external commonsense knowledge, or chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning instructions. However, it remains unclear when such information genuinely improves reasoning and when it introduces noise. In this paper, we conduct a hypothesis-driven analysis of information injection for VSR across three representative VLMs and two public benchmarks. We examine (i) the type and number of spatial contexts, (ii) the amount and relevance of injected commonsense knowledge, and (iii) the interaction between spatial grounding and CoT prompting. Our results reveal a consistent pattern: more information does not necessarily yield better reasoning. Targeted single spatial cues outperform multi-context aggregation, excessive or weakly relevant commonsense knowledge degrades performance, and CoT prompting improves accuracy only when spatial grounding is sufficiently precise. These findings highlight the importance of selective, task-aligned information injection and provide practical guidance for designing reliable multimodal reasoning pipelines.",

    "abstract": "Deep intracranial tumors situated in eloquent brain regions controlling vital functions present critical diagnostic challenges. Clinical practice has shifted toward stereotactic biopsy for pathological confirmation before treatment. Yet biopsy carries inherent risks of hemorrhage and neurological deficits and struggles with sampling bias due to tumor spatial heterogeneity, because pathological changes are typically region-selective rather than tumor-wide. Therefore, advancing non-invasive MRI-based pathology prediction is essential for holistic tumor assessment and modern clinical decision-making.   The primary challenge lies in data scarcity: low tumor incidence requires long collection cycles, and annotation demands biopsy-verified pathology from neurosurgical experts. Additionally, tiny lesion volumes lacking segmentation masks cause critical features to be overwhelmed by background noise. To address these challenges, we construct the ICT-MRI dataset - the first public biopsy-verified benchmark with 249 cases across four categories. We propose a Virtual Biopsy framework comprising: MRI-Processor for standardization; Tumor-Localizer employing vision-language models for coarse-to-fine localization via weak supervision; and Adaptive-Diagnoser with a Masked Channel Attention mechanism fusing local discriminative features with global contexts. Experiments demonstrate over 90% accuracy, outperforming baselines by more than 20%.",

Recent work has further explored augmenting these agents with memory mechanisms to support long-horizon reasoning. However, these approaches typically operate at a coarse instance granularity, treating the entire problem-solving episode as the atomic unit of storage and retrieval. We empirically demonstrate that instance-level memory suffers from a fundamental granularity mismatch, resulting in misguided retrieval when tasks with similar surface descriptions require distinct reasoning logic at specific stages. To address this, we propose Structurally Aligned Subtask-Level Memory, a method that aligns memory storage, retrieval, and updating with the agent's functional decomposition. Extensive experiments on SWE-bench Verified demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms both vanilla agents and strong instance-level memory baselines across diverse backbones, improving mean Pass@1 over the vanilla agent by +4.7 pp on average (e.g., +6.8 pp on Gemini 2.5 Pro).

WatchHand emits inaudible frequency-modulated continuous waves and captures their reflections from the hand. These acoustic signals are processed by a deep-learning model that estimates 3D hand poses for 20 finger joints. We evaluate WatchHand across diverse real-world conditions -- multiple smartwatch models, wearing-hands, body postures, noise conditions, pose-variation protocols -- and achieve a mean per-joint position error of 7.87 mm in cross-session tests with device remounting. Although performance drops for unseen users or gestures, the model adapts effectively with lightweight fine-tuning on small amounts of data. Overall, WatchHand lowers the barrier to smartwatch-based hand tracking by eliminating additional hardware while enabling robust, always-available interactions on millions of existing devices.",

Results show strong performance on humor detection but substantial degradation on sarcasm, offense, and vulgarity due to class imbalance and pragmatic complexity. Zero-shot models achieve competitive micro-F1 scores but low exact match accuracy. Further analysis reveals that over 42\\% of negative sentiment instances in an external dataset exhibit sarcastic characteristics. MixSarc provides a foundational resource for culturally aware NLP and supports more reliable multi-label modeling in code-mixed environments.",

    "abstract": "This paper argues that reliable end-to-end graph data analytics cannot be achieved by retrieval- or code-generation-centric LLM agents alone. Although large language models (LLMs) provide strong reasoning capabilities, practical graph analytics for non-expert users requires explicit analytical grounding to support intent-to-execution translation, task-aware graph construction, and reliable execution across diverse graph algorithms. We envision Analytics-Augmented Generation (AAG) as a new paradigm that treats analytical computation as a first-class concern and positions LLMs as knowledge-grounded analytical coordinators. By integrating knowledge-driven task planning, algorithm-centric LLM-analytics interaction, and task-aware graph construction, AAG enables end-to-end graph analytics pipelines that translate natural-language user intent into automated execution and interpretable results.",

Despite strong empirical performance, standard flow-matching objectives do not directly control the information geometry of the trajectory, allowing low-entropy bottlenecks that can transiently deplete semantic modes. We propose Entropy-Controlled Flow Matching (ECFM): a constrained variational principle over continuity-equation paths enforcing a global entropy-rate budget d/dt H(mu_t) >= -lambda. ECFM is a convex optimization in Wasserstein space with a KKT/Pontryagin system, and admits a stochastic-control representation equivalent to a Schrodinger bridge with an explicit entropy multiplier. In the pure transport regime, ECFM recovers entropic OT geodesics and Gamma-converges to classical OT as lambda -> 0. We further obtain certificate-style mode-coverage and density-floor guarantees with Lipschitz stability, and construct near-optimal collapse counterexamples for unconstrained flow matching.",

We investigate stress image using latent space representation which is based on using deep generative model (DGM). However, most DGM approaches are unsupervised, meaning they resort to image pairing (input and output) to train DGM. Instead, we rely on a recent boundary-decoder (BD) net, which uses boundary condition and image pairing for stress modeling. The boundary net maps material parameters to the latent space co-shared by its image counterpart. Because such a setup is dimensionally wise ill-posed, we further couple BD net with deep clustering. To access the performance of our proposed method, we simulate an IC chip dataset comprising of 1825 stress images. We compare our new approach using variants of BD net as well as a baseline approach.

    "abstract": "Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search has become fundamental to modern AI infrastructure, powering recommendation systems, search engines, and large language models across industry leaders from Google to OpenAI. Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) graphs have emerged as the dominant ANN algorithm, widely adopted in production systems due to their superior recall versus latency balance. However, as vector databases scale to billions of embeddings, HNSW faces critical bottlenecks: memory consumption expands, distance computation overhead dominates query latency, and it suffers suboptimal performance on heterogeneous data distributions. This paper presents Adaptive Quantization and Rerank HNSW (AQR-HNSW), a novel framework that synergistically integrates three strategies to enhance HNSW scalability. AQR-HNSW introduces (1) density-aware adaptive quantization, achieving 4x compression while preserving distance relationships; (2) multi-state re-ranking that reduces unnecessary computations by 35%; and (3) quantization-optimized SIMD implementations delivering 16-64 operations per cycle across architectures. Evaluation on standard benchmarks demonstrates 2.5-3.3x higher queries per second (QPS) than state-of-the-art HNSW implementations while maintaining over 98% recall, with 75% memory reduction for the index graph and 5x faster index construction.",

However, the fixed difficulty distribution of datasets limits the performance ceiling of the trained control policies. Additionally, the method of acquiring high-quality data through professional motion capture systems is constrained by costs, making it difficult to achieve large-scale scalability. To address these issues, we propose a closed-loop automated motion data generation and iterative framework. It can generate high-quality motion data with rich action semantics, including martial arts, dance, combat, sports, gymnastics, and more. Furthermore, our framework enables difficulty iteration of policies and data through physical metrics and objective evaluations, allowing the trained tracker to break through its original difficulty limits. On the PHC single-primitive tracker, using only approximately 1/10 of the AMASS dataset size, the average failure rate on the test set (2201 clips) is reduced by 45\\% compared to the baseline. Finally, we conduct comprehensive ablation and comparative experiments to highlight the rationality and advantages of our framework.",

We further find that semantic information is concentrated in a small subset of dimensions, with head dimensions carrying the dominant signal and tail dimensions contributing minimally. By pruning low-magnitude dimensions--removing up to two-thirds of the embedding space--we show that generation quality and fidelity remain largely unaffected, and in some cases improve. These results reveal a semantic bottleneck in Transformer-based diffusion models, providing new insights into how semantics are encoded and suggesting opportunities for more efficient conditioning mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Generative images have proliferated on Web platforms in social media and online copyright distribution scenarios, and semantic watermarking has increasingly been integrated into diffusion models to support reliable provenance tracking and forgery prevention for web content. Traditional noise-layer-based watermarking, however, remains vulnerable to inversion attacks that can recover embedded signals. To mitigate this, recent content-aware semantic watermarking schemes bind watermark signals to high-level image semantics, constraining local edits that would otherwise disrupt global coherence. Yet, large language models (LLMs) possess structured reasoning capabilities that enable targeted exploration of semantic spaces, allowing locally fine-grained but globally coherent semantic alterations that invalidate such bindings. To expose this overlooked vulnerability, we introduce a Coherence-Preserving Semantic Injection (CSI) attack that leverages LLM-guided semantic manipulation under embedding-space similarity constraints. This alignment enforces visual-semantic consistency while selectively perturbing watermark-relevant semantics, ultimately inducing detector misclassification. Extensive empirical results show that CSI consistently outperforms prevailing attack baselines against content-aware semantic watermarking, revealing a fundamental security weakness of current semantic watermark designs when confronted with LLM-driven semantic perturbations.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion-based generative image compression has demonstrated remarkable potential for achieving realistic reconstruction at ultra-low bitrates. The key to unlocking this potential lies in making the entire compression process content-adaptive, ensuring that the encoder's representation and the decoder's generative prior are dynamically aligned with the semantic and structural characteristics of the input image. However, existing methods suffer from three critical limitations that prevent effective content adaptation. First, isotropic quantization applies a uniform quantization step, failing to adapt to the spatially varying complexity of image content and creating a misalignment with the diffusion model's noise-dependent prior. Second, the information concentration bottleneck -- arising from the dimensional mismatch between the high-dimensional noisy latent and the diffusion decoder's fixed input -- prevents the model from adaptively preserving essential semantic information in the primary channels. Third, existing textual conditioning strategies either need significant textual bitrate overhead or rely on generic, content-agnostic textual prompts, thereby failing to provide adaptive semantic guidance efficiently. To overcome these limitations, we propose a content-adaptive diffusion-based image codec with three technical innovations: 1) an Uncertainty-Guided Adaptive Quantization method that learns spatial uncertainty maps to adaptively align quantization distortion with content characteristics; 2) an Auxiliary Decoder-Guided Information Concentration method that uses a lightweight auxiliary decoder to enforce content-aware information preservation in the primary latent channels; and 3) a Bitrate-Free Adaptive Textual Conditioning method that derives content-aware textual descriptions from the auxiliary reconstructed image, enabling semantic guidance without bitrate cost.",

    "abstract": "In recent engineering applications using deep learning, physics-informed neural network (PINN) is a new development as it can exploit the underlying physics of engineering systems. The novelty of PINN lies in the use of partial differential equations (PDE) for the loss function. Most PINNs are implemented using automatic differentiation (AD) for training the PDE loss functions. A lesser well-known study is the use of finite difference method (FDM) as an alternative. Unlike an AD based PINN, an immediate benefit of using a FDM based PINN is low implementation cost. In this paper, we propose the use of finite difference method for estimating the PDE loss functions in PINN. Our work is inspired by computational analysis in electromagnetic systems that traditionally solve Laplace's equation using successive over-relaxation. In the case of Laplace's equation, our PINN approach can be seen as taking the Laplacian filter response of the neural network output as the loss function. Thus, the implementation of PINN can be very simple. In our experiments, we tested PINN on Laplace's equation and Burger's equation. We showed that using FDM, PINN consistently outperforms non-PINN based deep learning. When comparing to AD based PINNs, we showed that our method is faster to compute as well as on par in terms of error reduction.",

    "abstract": "High-definition (HD) maps are essential for autonomous driving, yet multi-modal fusion often suffers from inconsistency between camera and LiDAR modalities, leading to performance degradation under low-light conditions, occlusions, or sparse point clouds. To address this, we propose SEFMAP, a Subspace-Expert Fusion framework for robust multimodal HD map prediction. The key idea is to explicitly disentangle BEV features into four semantic subspaces: LiDAR-private, Image-private, Shared, and Interaction. Each subspace is assigned a dedicated expert, thereby preserving modality-specific cues while capturing cross-modal consensus. To adaptively combine expert outputs, we introduce an uncertainty-aware gating mechanism at the BEV-cell level, where unreliable experts are down-weighted based on predictive variance, complemented by a usage balance regularizer to prevent expert collapse. To enhance robustness in degraded conditions and promote role specialization, we further propose distribution-aware masking: during training, modality-drop scenarios are simulated using EMA-statistical surrogate features, and a specialization loss enforces distinct behaviors of private, shared, and interaction experts across complete and masked inputs. Experiments on nuScenes and Argoverse2 benchmarks demonstrate that SEFMAP achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing prior methods by +4.2% and +4.8% in mAP, respectively. SEF-MAPprovides a robust and effective solution for multi-modal HD map prediction under diverse and degraded conditions.",

    "abstract": "Agent-based epidemic models (ABMs) encode behavioral and policy heterogeneity but are too slow for nightly hospital planning. We develop county-ready surrogates that learn directly from exascale ABM trajectories using Universal Differential Equations (UDEs): mechanistic SEIR-family ODEs with a neural-parameterized contact rate $κ_φ(u,t)$ (no additive residual). Our contributions are threefold: we adapt multiple shooting and an observer-based prediction-error method (PEM) to stabilize identification of neural-augmented epidemiological dynamics across intervention-driven regime shifts; we enforce positivity and mass conservation and show the learned contact-rate parameterization yields a well-posed vector field; and we quantify accuracy, calibration, and compute against ABM ensembles and UDE baselines. On a representative ExaEpi scenario, PEM-UDE reduces mean MSE by 77% relative to single-shooting UDE (3.00 vs. 13.14) and by 20% relative to MS-UDE (3.75). Reliability improves in parallel: empirical coverage of ABM $10$-$90$% and $25$-$75$% bands rises from 0.68/0.43 (UDE) and 0.79/0.55 (MS-UDE) to 0.86/0.61 with PEM-UDE and 0.94/0.69 with MS+PEM-UDE, indicating calibrated uncertainty rather than overconfident fits. Inference runs in seconds on commodity CPUs (20-35 s per $\\sim$90-day forecast), enabling nightly ''what-if'' sweeps on a laptop. Relative to a $\\sim$100 CPU-hour ABM reference run, this yields $\\sim10^{4}\\times$ lower wall-clock per scenario. This closes the realism-cadence gap, supports threshold-aware decision-making (e.g., maintaining ICU occupancy $<75$%), preserves mechanistic interpretability, and enables calibrated, risk-aware scenario planning on standard institutional hardware. Beyond epidemics, the ABM$\\to$UDE recipe provides a portable path to distill agent-based simulators into fast, trustworthy surrogates for other scientific domains.",

    "abstract": "Many applications seek to optimize LLM outputs at test time by iteratively proposing, scoring, and refining candidates over a discrete output space. Existing methods use a calibrated scalar evaluator for the target objective to guide search, but for many tasks such scores are unavailable, too sparse, or unreliable. Pairwise comparisons, by contrast, are often easier to elicit, still provide useful signal on improvement directions, and can be obtained from the LLM itself without external supervision. Building on this observation, we introduce Duel-Evolve, an evolutionary optimization algorithm that replaces external scalar rewards with pairwise preferences elicited from the same LLM used to generate candidates. Duel-Evolve aggregates these noisy candidate comparisons via a Bayesian Bradley-Terry model, yielding uncertainty-aware estimates of candidate quality. These quality estimates guide allocation of the comparison budget toward plausible optima using Double Thompson Sampling, as well as selection of high-quality parents to generate improved candidates. We evaluate Duel-Evolve on MathBench, where it achieves 20 percentage points higher accuracy over existing methods and baselines, and on LiveCodeBench, where it improves over comparable iterative methods by over 12 percentage points. Notably, the method requires no reward model, no ground-truth labels during search, and no hand-crafted scoring function. Results show that pairwise self-preferences provide strong optimization signal for test-time improvement over large, discrete output spaces.",

    "abstract": "Tilt-rotor aerial robots enable omnidirectional maneuvering through thrust vectoring, but introduce significant control challenges due to the strong coupling between joint and rotor dynamics. While model-based controllers can achieve high motion accuracy under nominal conditions, their robustness and responsiveness often degrade in the presence of disturbances and modeling uncertainties. This work investigates reinforcement learning for omnidirectional aerial motion control on over-actuated tiltable quadrotors that prioritizes robustness and agility. We present a learning-based control framework that enables efficient acquisition of coordinated rotor-joint behaviors for reaching target poses in the $SE(3)$ space. To achieve reliable sim-to-real transfer while preserving motion accuracy, we integrate system identification with minimal and physically consistent domain randomization. Compared with a state-of-the-art NMPC controller, the proposed method achieves comparable six-degree-of-freedom pose tracking accuracy, while demonstrating superior robustness and generalization across diverse tasks, enabling zero-shot deployment on real hardware.",

    "abstract": "Pose-guided human image animation aims to synthesize realistic videos of a reference character driven by a sequence of poses. While diffusion-based methods have achieved remarkable success, most existing approaches are limited to single-character animation. We observe that naively extending these methods to multi-character scenarios often leads to identity confusion and implausible occlusions between characters. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose an extensible multi-character image animation framework built upon modern Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) for video generation. At its core, our framework introduces two novel components-Identifier Assigner and Identifier Adapter - which collaboratively capture per-person positional cues and inter-person spatial relationships. This mask-driven scheme, along with a scalable training strategy, not only enhances flexibility but also enables generalization to scenarios with more characters than those seen during training. Remarkably, trained on only a two-character dataset, our model generalizes to multi-character animation while maintaining compatibility with single-character cases. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-character image animation, surpassing existing diffusion-based baselines.",

    "abstract": "Ordinal categorical data are widely collected in psychology, education, and other social sciences, appearing commonly in questionnaires, assessments, and surveys. Latent class models provide a flexible framework for uncovering unobserved heterogeneity by grouping individuals into homogeneous classes based on their response patterns. A fundamental challenge in applying these models is determining the number of latent classes, which is unknown and must be inferred from data. In this paper, we propose one test statistic for this problem. The test statistic centers the largest singular value of a normalized residual matrix by a simple sample-size adjustment. Under the null hypothesis that the candidate number of latent classes is correct, its upper bound converges to zero in probability. Under an under-fitted alternative, the statistic itself exceeds a fixed positive constant with probability approaching one. This sharp dichotomous behavior of the test statistic yields two sequential testing algorithms that consistently estimate the true number of latent classes. Extensive experimental studies confirm the theoretical findings and demonstrate their accuracy and reliability in determining the number of latent classes.",

    "abstract": "Estimating the asymmetric numbers of communities in multi-layer directed networks is a challenging problem due to the multi-layer structures and inherent directional asymmetry, leading to possibly different numbers of sender and receiver communities. This work addresses this issue under the multi-layer stochastic co-block model, a model for multi-layer directed networks with distinct community structures in sending and receiving sides, by proposing a novel goodness-of-fit test. The test statistic relies on the deviation of the largest singular value of an aggregated normalized residual matrix from the constant 2. The test statistic exhibits a sharp dichotomy: Under the null hypothesis of correct model specification, its upper bound converges to zero with high probability; under underfitting, the test statistic itself diverges to infinity. With this property, we develop a sequential testing procedure that searches through candidate pairs of sender and receiver community numbers in a lexicographic order. The process stops at the smallest such pair where the test statistic drops below a decaying threshold. For robustness, we also propose a ratio-based variant algorithm, which detects sharp changes in the sequence of test statistics by comparing consecutive candidates. Both methods are proven to consistently determine the true numbers of sender and receiver communities under the multi-layer stochastic co-block model.",

    "abstract": "Geo-distribution is essential for modern online applications to ensure service reliability and high availability. However, supporting high-performance serializable transactions in geo-replicated databases remains a significant challenge. This difficulty stems from the extensive over-coordination inherent in distributed atomic commitment, concurrency control, and fault-tolerance replication protocols under high network latency.   To address these challenges, we introduce Minerva, a unified distributed concurrency control designed for highly scalable multi-leader replication. Minerva employs a novel epoch-based asynchronous replication protocol that decouples data propagation from the commitment process, enabling continuous transaction replication. Optimistic concurrency control is used to allow any replicas to execute transactions concurrently and commit without coordination. In stead of aborting transactions when conflicts are detected, Minerva uses deterministic re-execution to resolve conflicts, ensuring serializability without sacrificing performance. To further enhance concurrency, we construct a conflict graph and use a maximum weight independent set algorithm to select the optimal subset of transactions for commitment, minimizing the number of re-executed transactions. Our evaluation demonstrates that Minerva significantly outperforms state-of-the-art replicated databases, achieving over $3\\times$ higher throughput in scalability experiments and $2.8\\times$ higher throughput during a high network latency simulation with the TPC-C benchmark.",

Further extending GFlowNets to multi-objective settings has attracted growing interest since real-world applications often involve multiple, conflicting objectives. However, existing approaches require additional training for each set of objectives, limiting their applicability and incurring substantial computational overhead. We propose a training-free mixing policy that composes pre-trained GFlowNets at inference time, enabling rapid adaptation without finetuning or retraining. Importantly, our framework is flexible, capable of handling diverse reward combinations ranging from linear scalarization to complex non-linear logical operators, which are often handled separately in previous literature. We prove that our method exactly recovers the target distribution for linear scalarization and quantify the approximation quality for nonlinear operators through a distortion factor. Experiments on a synthetic 2D grid and real-world molecule-generation tasks demonstrate that our approach achieves performance comparable to baselines that require additional training.",

    "abstract": "Terahertz (THz) communications has emerged as a promising technology for future wireless systems due to its potential to support extremely high data rates. However, severe path loss, blockage effects, and sensitivity to beam misalignment pose major challenges to reliable indoor THz communications. In this paper, we investigate the coverage probability of downlink transmission in a three-dimensional (3D) indoor THz communication system under structured access point (AP) deployments, with a focus on square and hexagonal grid topologies. A tractable analytical framework is developed to jointly account for human blockages, correlated wall blockages across APs, beam training, and residual pointing error. Numerical results demonstrate that wall blockage correlation significantly reduces the association and coverage probabilities, and its impact cannot be neglected in system performance analysis. Compared with square grid AP deployments, hexagonal grids consistently achieve higher coverage by mitigating correlated wall blockage effects and reducing the distances between user equipments (UEs) and their associated APs. Furthermore, coverage performance is shown to strongly depend on the UE location, with noticeable degradation as the UE moves away from its nearest AP. Residual pointing error is found to introduce substantial coverage loss, especially for longer links. In addition, beam training analysis reveals a non-monotonic relationship between antenna array size and training overhead, highlighting an inherent tradeoff among antenna configuration, beamwidth selection, and beam training efficiency. These findings provide useful insights into the design and deployment of practical indoor THz communication systems.",

    "abstract": "When designing compound AI systems, a common approach is to query multiple copies of the same model and aggregate the responses to produce a synthesized output. Given the homogeneity of these models, this raises the question of whether aggregation unlocks access to a greater set of outputs than querying a single model. In this work, we investigate the power and limitations of aggregation within a stylized principal-agent framework. This framework models how the system designer can partially steer each agent's output through its reward function specification, but still faces limitations due to prompt engineering ability and model capabilities. Our analysis uncovers three natural mechanisms -- feasibility expansion, support expansion, and binding set contraction -- through which aggregation expands the set of outputs that are elicitable by the system designer. We prove that any aggregation operation must implement one of these mechanisms in order to be elicitability-expanding, and that strengthened versions of these mechanisms provide necessary and sufficient conditions that fully characterize elicitability-expansion. Finally, we provide an empirical illustration of our findings for LLMs deployed in a toy reference-generation task. Altogether, our results take a step towards characterizing when compound AI systems can overcome limitations in model capabilities and in prompt engineering.",

    "abstract": "Accurate 3D scene understanding is essential for embodied intelligence, with occupancy prediction emerging as a key task for reasoning about both objects and free space. Existing approaches largely rely on depth priors (e.g., DepthAnything) but make only limited use of 3D cues, restricting performance and generalization. Recently, visual geometry models such as VGGT have shown strong capability in providing rich 3D priors, but similar to monocular depth foundation models, they still operate at the level of visible surfaces rather than volumetric interiors, motivating us to explore how to more effectively leverage these increasingly powerful geometry priors for 3D occupancy prediction. We present GPOcc, a framework that leverages generalizable visual geometry priors (GPs) for monocular occupancy prediction. Our method extends surface points inward along camera rays to generate volumetric samples, which are represented as Gaussian primitives for probabilistic occupancy inference. To handle streaming input, we further design a training-free incremental update strategy that fuses per-frame Gaussians into a unified global representation. Experiments on Occ-ScanNet and EmbodiedOcc-ScanNet demonstrate significant gains: GPOcc improves mIoU by +9.99 in the monocular setting and +11.79 in the streaming setting over prior state of the art. Under the same depth prior, it achieves +6.73 mIoU while running 2.65$\\times$ faster. These results highlight that GPOcc leverages geometry priors more effectively and efficiently.

Previous works often focus on extending input sequence length to locate distal enhancers, which may influence target genes from hundreds of kilobases away. Our work first reveals that for current models, long sequence modeling can decrease performance. Even carefully designed algorithms only mitigate the performance degradation caused by long sequences. Instead, we find that proximal multimodal epigenomic signals near target genes prove more essential. Hence we focus on how to better integrate these signals, which has been overlooked. We find that different signal types serve distinct biological roles, with some directly marking active regulatory elements while others reflect background chromatin patterns that may introduce confounding effects. Simple concatenation may lead models to develop spurious associations with these background patterns. To address this challenge, we propose Prism, a framework that learns multiple combinations of high-dimensional epigenomic features to represent distinct background chromatin states and uses backdoor adjustment to mitigate confounding effects. Our experimental results demonstrate that proper modeling of multimodal epigenomic signals achieves state-of-the-art performance using only short sequences for gene expression prediction.",

    "title": "DualPath: Breaking the Storage Bandwidth Bottleneck in Agentic LLM Inference",
    "abstract": "The performance of multi-turn, agentic LLM inference is increasingly dominated by KV-Cache storage I/O rather than computation. In prevalent disaggregated architectures, loading the massive KV-Cache from external storage creates a fundamental imbalance: storage NICs on prefill engines become bandwidth-saturated, while those on decoding engines remain idle. This asymmetry severely constrains overall system throughput.   We present DualPath, an inference system that breaks this bottleneck by introducing dual-path KV-Cache loading. Beyond the traditional storage-to-prefill path, DualPath enables a novel storage-to-decode path, in which the KV-Cache is loaded into decoding engines and then efficiently transferred to prefill engines via RDMA over the compute network. DualPath combines this optimized data path -- which inherently avoids network congestion and avoids interference with latency-critical model execution communications -- with a global scheduler that dynamically balances load across prefill and decode engines.   Our evaluation on three models with production agentic workloads demonstrates that DualPath improves offline inference throughput by up to 1.87$\\times$ on our in-house inference system. It can also improve online serving throughput by an average factor of 1.96$\\times$ without violating SLO.",

    "abstract": "The scaling of Large Language Model (LLM) services faces significant cost and latency challenges, making effective caching under tight capacity crucial. Existing cache replacement policies, from heuristics to learning-based methods, predominantly rely on limited-window statistics such as recency and frequency. We show these signals are not robust for real-world LLM workloads, which exhibit long reuse distances and sparse local recurrence.   To address these limitations, we propose Relation-Aware Cache (RAC), an online eviction strategy that leverages semantic relations among requests to guide eviction decisions. RAC synthesizes two relation-aware signals: (1) Topical Prevalence, which aggregates access evidence at the topic level to capture long-horizon reuse; and (2) Structural Importance, which leverages local intra-topic dependency structure to discriminate entries by their future reuse value. Extensive evaluations show that RAC maintains high effectiveness across diverse workloads, consistently surpassing state-of-the-art baselines by 20%--30% in cache hit ratio.",

    "abstract": "The Flexible Job Shop Problem (FJSP) is a well-studied combinatorial optimization problem with extensive applications for manufacturing and production scheduling. It involves assigning jobs to various machines to optimize criteria, such as minimizing total completion time. Current learning-based methods in this domain often rely on localized feature extraction models, limiting their capacity to capture overarching dependencies spanning operations and machines. This paper introduces an innovative architecture that harnesses Mamba, a state-space model with linear computational complexity, to facilitate comprehensive sequence modeling tailored for FJSP. In contrast to prevalent graph-attention-based frameworks that are computationally intensive for FJSP, we show our model is more efficient. Specifically, the proposed model possesses an encoder and a decoder. The encoder incorporates a dual Mamba block to extract operation and machine features separately. Additionally, we introduce an efficient cross-attention decoder to learn interactive embeddings of operations and machines. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves faster solving speed and surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art learning-based methods for FJSP across various benchmarks.",

    "abstract": "Multilingual pretraining typically lacks explicit alignment signals, leading to suboptimal cross-lingual alignment in the representation space. In this work, we show that training standard pretrained models for cross-lingual alignment with a multi-way parallel corpus in a diverse pool of languages can substantially improve multilingual and cross-lingual representations for NLU tasks. We construct a multi-way parallel dataset using translations of English text from an off-the-shelf NMT model for a pool of six target languages and achieve strong cross-lingual alignment through contrastive learning. This leads to substantial performance gains across both seen and unseen languages for multiple tasks from the MTEB benchmark evaluated for XLM-Roberta and multilingual BERT base models. Using a multi-way parallel corpus for contrastive training yields substantial gains on bitext mining (21.3%), semantic similarity (5.3%), and classification (28.4%) compared to English-centric (En-X) bilingually parallel data, where X is sampled from a pool of multiple target languages. Furthermore, finetuning mE5 model on a small dataset with multi-way parallelism significantly improves bitext mining compared to one without, underscoring the importance of multi-way cross-lingual supervision even for models already pretrained for high-quality sentence embeddings.",

As a result, they often produce indistinct boundaries near vessels and show limited generalization under anatomical variability.We propose VasGuideNet, the first Couinaud segmentation framework explicitly guided by vascular topology. Specifically, skeletonized vessels, Euclidean distance transform (EDT)--derived geometry, and k-nearest neighbor (kNN) connectivity are encoded into topology features using Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs). These features are then injected into a 3D encoder--decoder backbone via a cross-attention fusion module. To further improve inter-class separability and anatomical consistency, we introduce a Structural Contrastive Loss (SCL) with a global memory bank.On Task08_HepaticVessel and our private LASSD dataset, VasGuideNet achieves Dice scores of 83.68% and 76.65% with RVDs of 1.68 and 7.08, respectively. It consistently outperforms representative baselines including UNETR, Swin UNETR, and G-UNETR++, delivering higher Dice/mIoU and lower RVD across datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness for anatomically consistent segmentation.

To address these challenges, we introduce IHF-Harmony, a unified invertible hierarchy flow framework for multi-modality harmonization using unpaired data. By decomposing the translation process into reversible feature transformations, IHF-Harmony guarantees bijective mapping and lossless reconstruction to prevent anatomical distortion. Specifically, an invertible hierarchy flow (IHF) performs hierarchical subtractive coupling to progressively remove artefact-related features, while an artefact-aware normalization (AAN) employs anatomy-fixed feature modulation to accurately transfer target characteristics. Combined with anatomy and artefact consistency loss objectives, IHF-Harmony achieves high-fidelity harmonization that retains source anatomy. Experiments across multiple MRI modalities demonstrate that IHF-Harmony outperforms existing methods in both anatomical fidelity and downstream task performance, facilitating robust harmonization for large-scale multi-site imaging studies.

With extremely limited input views, directly utilizing diffusion model to synthesize pseudo frames will introduce unreasonable geometry, which will harm the final reconstruction quality. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework for sparse-view outdoor reconstruction that achieves high-quality results through bidirectional pseudo frame restoration and scene perception Gaussian management. Specifically, we introduce a bidirectional pseudo frame restoration method that restores missing content by diffusion-based synthesis guided by adjacent frames with a lightweight pseudo-view deblur model and confidence mask inference algorithm. Then we propose a scene perception Gaussian management strategy that optimize Gaussians based on joint depth-density information. These designs significantly enhance reconstruction completeness, suppress floating artifacts and improve overall geometric consistency under extreme view sparsity.

Despite encouraging early results, ARL remains highly unstable, often leading to training collapse. This instability limits scalability to larger environments and longer interaction horizons, and constrains systematic exploration of algorithmic design choices. In this paper, we first propose ARLArena, a stable training recipe and systematic analysis framework that examines training stability in a controlled and reproducible setting. ARLArena first constructs a clean and standardized testbed. Then, we decompose policy gradient into four core design dimensions and assess the performance and stability of each dimension. Through this fine-grained analysis, we distill a unified perspective on ARL and propose SAMPO, a stable agentic policy optimization method designed to mitigate the dominant sources of instability in ARL. Empirically, SAMPO achieves consistently stable training and strong performance across diverse agentic tasks. Overall, this study provides a unifying policy gradient perspective for ARL and offers practical guidance for building stable and reproducible LLM-based agent training pipelines.",

Here, we present a Multi-Agent-based Electrocatalyst Search Through Reasoning and Optimization (MAESTRO) framework in which multiple LLMs with specialized roles collaboratively discover high-performance single atom catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction. Within an autonomous design loop, agents iteratively reason, propose modifications, reflect on results and accumulate design history.

    "abstract": "Large language models have become central to many AI applications, but their growing energy consumption raises serious sustainability concerns. A key limitation in current AI deployments is the reliance on a one-size-fits-all inference strategy where most systems route every request to the same large model, regardless of task complexity, leading to substantial and unnecessary energy waste. To address this issue, we propose a context-aware model switching approach that dynamically selects an appropriate language model based on query complexity. The proposed system uses a Context-Aware Model Switching for Energy-Efficient LLM Inference that combines caching for repeated queries, rulebased complexity scoring for fast and explainable decisions, machine learning classification to capture semantic intent, and a user-adaptive component that learns from interaction patterns over time. The proposed architecture was evaluated using real conversation workloads and three open-source language models (Gemma3 1B, Gemma3 4B and Qwen3 4B) with different computational costs, measuring energy consumption (via NVML GPU power telemetry), response latency, routing accuracy, and output quality (BERTScore F1) to reflect real-world usage conditions. Experimental results show that the model switching approach can reduce energy consumption by up to 67.5% compared to always using the largest model while maintaining a response quality of 93.6%. In addition, the response time for simple queries also improved significantly by approximately 68%. These results show that model switching inference offers a practical and scalable path toward more energy-efficient and sustainable AI systems, demonstrating that significant efficiency gains can be achieved without major sacrifices in response quality.",

While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models offer the potential to master diverse atomic skills, they struggle with the combinatorial complexity of sequencing them and are prone to cascading failures due to environmental sensitivity. To address these challenges, we propose LiLo-VLA (Linked Local VLA), a modular framework capable of zero-shot generalization to novel long-horizon tasks without ever being trained on them. Our approach decouples transport from interaction: a Reaching Module handles global motion, while an Interaction Module employs an object-centric VLA to process isolated objects of interest, ensuring robustness against irrelevant visual features and invariance to spatial configurations. Crucially, this modularity facilitates robust failure recovery through dynamic replanning and skill reuse, effectively mitigating the cascading errors common in end-to-end approaches. We introduce a 21-task simulation benchmark consisting of two challenging suites: LIBERO-Long++ and Ultra-Long. In these simulations, LiLo-VLA achieves a 69% average success rate, outperforming Pi0.5 by 41% and OpenVLA-OFT by 67%.

In traditional wireless systems, signals propagate through the air, where they are vulnerable to interference, attenuation, and jamming. Guided communication, in contrast, confines signals within a physical medium, significantly reducing interference and supporting higher data rates over longer distances. Guided wireless technology harnesses these benefits by creating guided wireless channels and offering a controlled pathway for electromagnetic waves. This work harnesses these benefits by focusing on the modeling of near-field communication through long connected arrays deployed in linear-cell environments. We derive a circuit model for long array as an infinitely long dipole with multiple periodic feed points before approximating it with a finite array through open circuiting. Through our simulations, we show how the standing wave phenomenon is confirmed by the oscillations in spectral efficiency. We also demonstrate the capability of the LMMSE transmit beamformer in mitigating interference and minimizing the mean square error by adaptively allocating more power to the user experiencing the most severe channel attenuation, resulting in a more balanced variation of achievable rates across users.",

    "title": "Quantum Attacks Targeting Nuclear Power Plants: Threat Analysis, Defense and Mitigation Strategies",
    "abstract": "The advent of Cryptographically Relevant Quantum Computers (CRQCs) presents a fundamental and existential threat to the forensic integrity and operational safety of Industrial Control Systems (ICS) and Operational Technology (OT) in critical infrastructure. This paper introduces a novel, forensics-first framework for achieving quantum resilience in high-consequence environments, with a specific focus on nuclear power plants. We systematically analyze the quantum threat landscape across the Purdue architecture (L0-L5), detailing how Harvest-Now, Decrypt-Later (HNDL) campaigns, enabled by algorithms like Shor's, can retroactively compromise cryptographic foundations, undermine evidence admissibility, and facilitate sophisticated sabotage. Through two detailed case studies, \\textsc{Quantum~Scar} and \\textsc{Quantum~Dawn}, we demonstrate multi-phase attack methodologies where state-level adversaries exploit cryptographic monoculture and extended OT lifecycles to degrade safety systems while creating unsolvable forensic paradoxes. Our probabilistic risk modeling reveals alarming success probabilities (up to 78\\% for targeted facilities under current defenses), underscoring the criticality of immediate action. In response, we propose and validate a phased, defense-in-depth migration path to Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC), integrating hybrid key exchange, cryptographic diversity, secure time synchronization, and side-channel resistant implementations aligned with ISA/IEC 62443 and NIST standards. The paper concludes that without urgent adoption of quantum-resilient controls, the integrity of both physical safety systems and digital forensic evidence remains at severe and irreversible risk.",

    "abstract": "Deciphering brain function through non-invasive recordings requires synthesizing complementary high-frequency electromagnetic (EEG/MEG) and low-frequency metabolic (fMRI) signals. However, despite their shared neural origins, extreme discrepancies have traditionally confined these modalities to isolated analysis pipelines, hindering a holistic interpretation of brain activity. To bridge this fragmentation, we introduce \\textbf{NOBEL}, a \\textbf{n}euro-\\textbf{o}mni-modal \\textbf{b}rain-\\textbf{e}ncoding \\textbf{l}arge language model (LLM) that unifies these heterogeneous signals within the LLM's semantic embedding space. Our architecture integrates a unified encoder for EEG and MEG with a novel dual-path strategy for fMRI, aligning non-invasive brain signals and external sensory stimuli into a shared token space, then leverages an LLM as a universal backbone. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that NOBEL serves as a robust generalist across standard single-modal tasks. We also show that the synergistic fusion of electromagnetic and metabolic signals yields higher decoding accuracy than unimodal baselines, validating the complementary nature of multiple neural modalities. Furthermore, NOBEL exhibits strong capabilities in stimulus-aware decoding, effectively interpreting visual semantics from multi-subject fMRI data on the NSD and HAD datasets while uniquely leveraging direct stimulus inputs to verify causal links between sensory signals and neural responses. NOBEL thus takes a step towards unifying non-invasive brain decoding, demonstrating the promising potential of omni-modal brain understanding.",

    "abstract": "AI agents with tool-use capabilities show promise for integrating the domain expertise of various tools. In the medical field, however, tools are usually AI models that are inherently error-prone and can produce contradictory responses. Existing research on medical agents lacks sufficient understanding of the tools' realistic reliability and thus cannot effectively resolve tool conflicts. To address this gap, this paper introduces a framework that enables an agent to interact with tools and empirically learn their practical trustworthiness across different types of multimodal queries via agentic learning. As a concrete instantiation, we focus on chest X-ray analysis and present a tool-expertise-aware chest X-ray agent (TEA-CXA). When tool outputs disagree, the agent experimentally accepts or rejects multimodal tool results, receives rewards, and learns which tool to trust for each query type. Importantly, TEA-CXA extends existing codebases for reinforcement learning with multi-turn tool-calling that focus on textual inputs, to support multimodal contexts effectively. In addition, we enhance the codebase for medical use scenarios by supporting multiple tool calls in one turn, parallel tool inference, and multi-image accommodation within a single user query. Our code framework is applicable to general medical research on multi-turn tool-calling reinforcement learning in multimodal settings. Experiments show that TEA-CXA outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and a comprehensive set of baselines. Code will be released.",

    "abstract": "Many emerging agentic paradigms require agents to collaborate with one another (or people) to achieve shared goals. Unfortunately, existing approaches to learning policies for such collaborative problems produce brittle solutions that fail when paired with new partners. We attribute these failures to a combination of free-riding during training and a lack of strategic robustness. To address these problems, we study the concept of strategic risk aversion and interpret it as a principled inductive bias for generalizable cooperation with unseen partners. While strategically risk-averse players are robust to deviations in their partner's behavior by design, we show that, in collaborative games, they also (1) can have better equilibrium outcomes than those at classical game-theoretic concepts like Nash, and (2) exhibit less or no free-riding. Inspired by these insights, we develop a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm that integrates strategic risk aversion into standard policy optimization methods. Our empirical results across collaborative benchmarks (including an LLM collaboration task) validate our theory and demonstrate that our approach consistently achieves reliable collaboration with heterogeneous and previously unseen partners across collaborative tasks.",

We present an I/O-first framework for disk-based ANN that organizes techniques along three dimensions: memory layout, disk layout, and search algorithm. We introduce a page-level complexity model that explains how page locality and path length jointly determine page reads, and we validate the model empirically. Using consistent implementations across four public datasets, we quantify both single-factor effects and cross-dimensional synergies. We find that (i) memory-resident navigation and dynamic width provide the strongest standalone gains; (ii) page shuffle and page search are weak alone but complementary together; and (iii) a principled composition, OctopusANN, substantially reduces I/O and achieves 4.1--37.9\\% higher throughput than the state-of-the-art system Starling and 87.5--149.5\\% higher throughput than DiskANN at matched Recall@10=90\\%.

    "abstract": "The goal of fair clustering is to find clusters such that the proportion of sensitive attributes (e.g., gender, race, etc.) in each cluster is similar to that of the entire dataset. Various fair clustering algorithms have been proposed that modify standard K-means clustering to satisfy a given fairness constraint. A critical limitation of several existing fair clustering algorithms is that the number of parameters to be learned is proportional to the sample size because the cluster assignment of each datum should be optimized simultaneously with the cluster center, and thus scaling up the algorithms is difficult. In this paper, we propose a new fair clustering algorithm based on a finite mixture model, called Fair Model-based Clustering (FMC). A main advantage of FMC is that the number of learnable parameters is independent of the sample size and thus can be scaled up easily. In particular, mini-batch learning is possible to obtain clusters that are approximately fair. Moreover, FMC can be applied to non-metric data (e.g., categorical data) as long as the likelihood is well-defined. Theoretical and empirical justifications for the superiority of the proposed algorithm are provided.",

We identify that existing methods fail because they entangle the watermark with high-frequency cover texture, which is susceptible to being rewritten during generative purification. To address this, we propose WaterVIB, a theoretically grounded framework that reformulates the encoder as an information sieve via the Variational Information Bottleneck. Instead of overfitting to fragile cover details, our approach forces the model to learn a Minimal Sufficient Statistic of the message. This effectively filters out redundant cover nuances prone to generative shifts, retaining only the essential signal invariant to regeneration. We theoretically prove that optimizing this bottleneck is a necessary condition for robustness against distribution-shifting attacks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WaterVIB significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior zero-shot resilience against unknown diffusion-based editing.",

Current face recognition methods achieve over 99.8% accuracy on standard benchmarks but drop dramatically to 88.9% when distinguishing identical twins, exposing critical vulnerabilities in biometric security systems. The difficulty lies in learning features that capture subtle, non-genetic variations that uniquely identify individuals. We propose the Asymmetric Hierarchical Attention Network (AHAN), a novel architecture specifically designed for this challenge through multi-granularity facial analysis. AHAN introduces a Hierarchical Cross-Attention (HCA) module that performs multi-scale analysis on semantic facial regions, enabling specialized processing at optimal resolutions. We further propose a Facial Asymmetry Attention Module (FAAM) that learns unique biometric signatures by computing cross-attention between left and right facial halves, capturing subtle asymmetric patterns that differ even between twins. To ensure the network learns truly individuating features, we introduce Twin-Aware Pair-Wise Cross-Attention (TA-PWCA), a training-only regularization strategy that uses each subject's own twin as the hardest possible distractor. Extensive experiments on the ND_TWIN dataset demonstrate that AHAN achieves 92.3% twin verification accuracy, representing a 3.4% improvement over state-of-the-art methods.",

The presentation is modular: we state broadly applicable guarantees under high-level conditions and give tools for verifying them for specific losses and function classes. We emphasize that many ERM rate derivations can be organized around a three-step recipe -- a basic inequality, a uniform local concentration bound, and a fixed-point argument -- which yields regret bounds in terms of a critical radius, defined via localized Rademacher complexity, under a mild Bernstein-type variance--risk condition. To make these bounds concrete, we upper bound the critical radius using local maximal inequalities and metric-entropy integrals, recovering familiar rates for VC-subgraph, Sobolev/Hölder, and bounded-variation classes.   We also review ERM with nuisance components -- including weighted ERM and Neyman-orthogonal losses -- as they arise in causal inference, missing data, and domain adaptation. Following the orthogonal learning framework, we highlight that these problems often admit regret-transfer bounds linking regret under an estimated loss to population regret under the target loss. These bounds typically decompose regret into (i) statistical error under the estimated (optimized) loss and (ii) approximation error due to nuisance estimation. Under sample splitting or cross-fitting, the first term can be controlled using standard fixed-loss ERM regret bounds, while the second term depends only on nuisance-estimation accuracy. We also treat the in-sample regime, where nuisances and the ERM are fit on the same data, deriving regret bounds and giving sufficient conditions for fast rates.",

To address the challenge, we propose ReIMTS, a Recursive multi-scale modeling approach for Irregular Multivariate Time Series forecasting. Instead of resampling, ReIMTS keeps timestamps unchanged and recursively splits each sample into subsamples with progressively shorter time periods.

    "abstract": "Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning ability by generating long chain-of-thought (CoT) responses. However, CoT reasoning in multimodal contexts is highly vulnerable to visual hallucination propagation: once an intermediate reasoning step becomes inconsistent with the visual evidence, subsequent steps-even if logically valid-can still lead to incorrect final answers. Existing solutions attempt to mitigate this issue by training models to \"think with images\" via reinforcement learning (RL). While effective, these methods are costly, model-specific, and difficult to generalize across architectures. Differently, we present a lightweight method that bypasses RL training and provides an iterative, training-free, plug-and-play framework for visually-grounded multimodal reasoning. Our key idea is to supervise each reasoning step at test time with visual evidence, ensuring that every decoded token is justified by corresponding visual cues. Concretely, we construct a textual visual-evidence pool that guides the model's reasoning generation. When existing evidence is insufficient, a visual decider module dynamically extracts additional relevant evidence from the image based on the ongoing reasoning context, expanding the pool until the model achieves sufficient visual certainty to terminate reasoning and produce the final answer. Extensive experiments on multiple LVLM backbones and benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our method achieves 16.5%-29.5% improvements on TreeBench and 13.7% RH-AUC gains on RH-Bench, substantially reducing hallucination rates while improving reasoning accuracy without additional training.",

The capacity of LLMs to self-regulate these complex, context-dependent sensitive information leaks without destroying utility remains an open scientific question. To address this, we introduce SemSIEdit, an inference-time framework where an agentic \"Editor\" iteratively critiques and rewrites sensitive spans to preserve narrative flow rather than simply refusing to answer. Our analysis reveals a Privacy-Utility Pareto Frontier, where this agentic rewriting reduces leakage by 34.6% across all three SemSI categories while incurring a marginal utility loss of 9.8%. We also uncover a Scale-Dependent Safety Divergence: large reasoning models (e.g., GPT-5) achieve safety through constructive expansion (adding nuance), whereas capacity-constrained models revert to destructive truncation (deleting text). Finally, we identify a Reasoning Paradox: while inference-time reasoning increases baseline risk by enabling the model to make deeper sensitive inferences, it simultaneously empowers the defense to execute safe rewrites.",

    "abstract": "Congestion pricing has emerged as an effective tool for mitigating traffic congestion, yet implementing welfare or revenue-optimal dynamic tolls is often impractical. Most real-world congestion pricing deployments, including New York City's recent program, rely on significantly simpler, often static, tolls. This discrepancy motivates the question of how much revenue and welfare loss there is when real-world traffic systems use static rather than optimal dynamic pricing.   We address this question by analyzing the performance gap between static (simple) and dynamic (optimal) congestion pricing schemes in two canonical frameworks: Vickrey's bottleneck model with a public transit outside option and its city-scale extension based on the Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD). In both models, we first characterize the revenue-optimal static and dynamic tolling policies, which have received limited attention in prior work. In the worst-case, revenue-optimal static tolls achieve at least half of the dynamic optimal revenue and at most twice the minimum achievable system cost across a wide range of practically relevant parameter regimes, with stronger and more general guarantees in the bottleneck model than in the MFD model. We further corroborate our theoretical guarantees with numerical results based on real-world datasets from the San Francisco Bay Area and New York City, which demonstrate that static tolls achieve roughly 80-90% of the dynamic optimal revenue while incurring at most a 8-20% higher total system cost than the minimum achievable system cost.",

As a result, prior work often relies on manual curation or simple heuristic filters (e.g., accuracy), which can admit incorrect or low-utility problems. We propose GradAlign, a gradient-aligned data selection method for LLM reinforcement learning that uses a small, trusted validation set to prioritize training problems whose policy gradients align with validation gradients, yielding an adaptive curriculum. We evaluate GradAlign across three challenging data regimes: unreliable reward signals, distribution imbalance, and low-utility training corpus, showing that GradAlign consistently outperforms existing baselines, underscoring the importance of directional gradient signals in navigating non-stationary policy optimization and yielding more stable training and improved final performance. We release our implementation at https://github.com/StigLidu/GradAlign",

We extend Code World Models (CWMs), LLM-synthesized Python programs that predict environment dynamics, from deterministic games to stochastic combinatorial optimization. Given suboptimal trajectories of $(1{+}1)$-$\\text{RLS}_k$, the LLM synthesizes a simulator of the optimizer's dynamics; greedy planning over this simulator then selects the mutation strength $k$ at each step. On \\lo{} and \\onemax{}, CWM-greedy performs within 6\\% of the theoretically optimal policy -- without ever seeing optimal-policy trajectories. On \\jump{$_k$}, where a deceptive valley causes all adaptive baselines to fail (0\\% success rate), CWM-greedy achieves 100\\% success rate -- without any collection policy using oracle knowledge of the gap parameter. On the NK-Landscape, where no closed-form model exists, CWM-greedy outperforms all baselines across fifteen independently generated instances ($36.94$ vs.\\ $36.32$; $p<0.001$) when the prompt includes empirical transition statistics. The CWM also outperforms DQN in sample efficiency (200 offline trajectories vs.\\ 500 online episodes), success rate (100\\% vs.\\ 58\\%), and generalization ($k{=}3$: 78\\% vs.\\ 0\\%).

    "abstract": "Recognizing the substantial computational cost of backpropagation (BP), non-BP methods have emerged as attractive alternatives for efficient learning on emerging neuromorphic systems. However, existing non-BP approaches still face critical challenges in efficiency and scalability. Inspired by neural representations and dynamic mechanisms in the brain, we propose a perturbation-based approach called LOw-rank Cluster Orthogonal (LOCO) weight modification. We find that low-rank is an inherent property of perturbation-based algorithms. Under this condition, the orthogonality constraint limits the variance of the node perturbation (NP) gradient estimates and enhances the convergence efficiency. Through extensive evaluations on multiple datasets, LOCO demonstrates the capability to locally train the deepest spiking neural networks to date (more than 10 layers), while exhibiting strong continual learning ability, improved convergence efficiency, and better task performance compared to other brain-inspired non-BP algorithms. Notably, LOCO requires only O(1) parallel time complexity for weight updates, which is significantly lower than that of BP methods. This offers a promising direction for achieving high-performance, real-time, and lifelong learning on neuromorphic systems.",

    "abstract": "In AI, most evaluations of natural language understanding tasks are conducted in standardized dialects such as Standard American English (SAE). In this work, we investigate how accurately large language models (LLMs) represent African American Vernacular English (AAVE). We analyze three LLMs to compare their usage of AAVE to the usage of humans who natively speak AAVE. We first analyzed interviews from the Corpus of Regional African American Language and TwitterAAE to identify the typical contexts where people use AAVE grammatical features such as ain't. We then prompted the LLMs to produce text in AAVE and compared the model-generated text to human usage patterns. We find that, in many cases, there are substantial differences between AAVE usage in LLMs and humans: LLMs usually underuse and misuse grammatical features characteristic of AAVE. Furthermore, through sentiment analysis and manual inspection, we found that the models replicated stereotypes about African Americans. These results highlight the need for more diversity in training data and the incorporation of fairness methods to mitigate the perpetuation of stereotypes.",

    "abstract": "3D object detection is essential for autonomous driving and robotic perception, yet its reliance on large-scale manually annotated data limits scalability and adaptability. To reduce annotation dependency, unsupervised and sparsely-supervised paradigms have emerged. However, they face intertwined challenges: low-quality pseudo-labels, unstable feature mining, and a lack of a unified training framework. This paper proposes SPL, a unified training framework for both Unsupervised and Sparsely-Supervised 3D Object Detection via Semantic Pseudo-labeling and prototype Learning. SPL first generates high-quality pseudo-labels by integrating image semantics, point cloud geometry, and temporal cues, producing both 3D bounding boxes for dense objects and 3D point labels for sparse ones. These pseudo-labels are not used directly but as probabilistic priors within a novel, multi-stage prototype learning strategy. This strategy stabilizes feature representation learning through memory-based initialization and momentum-based prototype updating, effectively mining features from both labeled and unlabeled data. Extensive experiments on KITTI and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that SPL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both settings. Our work provides a robust and generalizable solution for learning 3D object detectors with minimal or no manual annotations.",

To address this issue, we propose an \\textit{Efficient Perceptual Bi-directional Attention Network (Efficient-PBAN)} that explicitly optimizes SR towards human-preferred quality. Unlike patch-based quality models, Efficient-PBAN avoids extensive patch sampling and enables efficient image-level perception. The proposed framework is trained on our self-constructed SR quality dataset that covers a wide range of state-of-the-art SR methods with corresponding human opinion scores. Using this dataset, Efficient-PBAN learns to predict perceptual quality in a way that correlates strongly with subjective judgments. The learned metric is further integrated into SR training as a differentiable perceptual loss, enabling closed-loop alignment between reconstruction and perceptual assessment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach delivers superior perceptual quality. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/Lighting-YXLI/Efficient-PBAN.",

    "abstract": "Recruiting academically strong students into NSF S-STEM scholarship programs remains a persistent challenge in computer science education. This paper presents the design and initial implementation of a suite of targeted recruitment strategies for our NSF-funded project. Our recruitment strategy leverages multiple channels. Information sessions and early outreach efforts were employed to increase awareness and reduce perceived barriers to applying. Data from our recruitment includes applicant demographics, academic performance, financial aid profiles, recruitment source tracking, and survey responses on students awareness and decision-making processes. These data provide a foundation for evaluating the reach and effectiveness of various recruitment strategies and identifying factors that influence student application decisions. Quantitative and qualitative research approaches are employed to examine the implementation and outcomes of proactive recruitment strategies. Our preliminary analysis indicates that direct information sessions and departmental emails are effective recruitment strategies, accounting for a large portion of eligible applications. Our findings emphasize the importance of early communication about the program, clearly defined eligibility criteria, and a streamlined application process. By sharing ongoing progress and lessons learned from our project, this paper contributes evidence-based insights into recruitment practices and offers strategies that can be adapted by other institutions implementing NSF S-STEM programs.",

    "abstract": "Text-to-SQL and Big Data are both extensively benchmarked fields, yet there is limited research that evaluates them jointly. In the real world, Text-to-SQL systems are often embedded with Big Data workflows, such as large-scale data processing or interactive data analytics. We refer to this as \"Text-to-Big SQL\". However, existing text-to-SQL benchmarks remain narrowly scoped and overlook the cost and performance implications that arise at scale. For instance, translation errors that are minor on small datasets lead to substantial cost and latency overheads as data scales, a relevant issue completely ignored by text-to-SQL metrics.   In this paper, we overcome this overlooked challenge by introducing novel and representative metrics for evaluating Text-to-Big SQL. Our study focuses on production-level LLM agents, a database-agnostic system adaptable to diverse user needs. Via an extensive evaluation of frontier models, we show that text-to-SQL metrics are insufficient for Big Data. In contrast, our proposed text-to-Big SQL metrics accurately reflect execution efficiency, cost, and the impact of data scale. Furthermore, we provide LLM-specific insights, including fine-grained, cross-model comparisons of latency and cost.",

This can be modeled as a sequential hypothesis testing problem with $k$ incoming streams of data and a global null hypothesis that asserts that the system is working as expected across all $k$ streams. The standard global test employs a Bonferroni correction and has an expected stopping time bound of $O\\left(\\ln\\frac{k}α\\right)$ when $k$ is large and the significance level of the test, $α$, is small. In this work, we construct new sequential tests by using ideas of merging test martingales with different trade-offs in expected stopping times under different, sparse or dense alternative hypotheses. We further derive a new, balanced test that achieves an improved expected stopping time bound that matches Bonferroni's in the sparse setting but that naturally results in $O\\left(\\frac{1}{k}\\ln\\frac{1}α\\right)$ under a dense alternative.

    "abstract": "Training-data poisoning attacks can induce targeted, undetectable failure in deep neural networks by corrupting a vanishingly small fraction of training labels. We demonstrate this on acoustic vehicle classification using the MELAUDIS urban intersection dataset (approx. 9,600 audio clips, 6 classes): a compact 2-D convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on log-mel spectrograms achieves 95.7% Attack Success Rate (ASR) -- the fraction of target-class test samples misclassified under the attack -- on a Truck-to-Car label-flipping attack at just p=0.5% corruption (48 records), with zero detectable change in aggregate accuracy (87.6% baseline; 95% CI: 88-100%, n=3 seeds). We prove this stealth is structural: the maximum accuracy drop from a complete targeted attack is bounded above by the minority class fraction (beta). For real-world class imbalances (Truck approx. 3%), this bound falls below training-run noise, making aggregate accuracy monitoring provably insufficient regardless of architecture or attack method. A companion backdoor trigger attack reveals a novel trigger-dominance collapse: when the target class is a dataset minority, the spectrogram patch trigger becomes functionally redundant--clean ASR equals triggered ASR, and the attack degenerates to pure label flipping. We formalize the ML training pipeline as an attack surface and propose a trust-minimized defense combining content-addressed artifact hashing, Merkle-tree dataset commitment, and post-quantum digital signatures (ML-DSA-65/CRYSTALS-Dilithium3, NIST FIPS 204) for cryptographically verifiable data provenance.",

Under directional stability, we show that estimators that would have been efficient under i.i.d. data remain asymptotically normal and semiparametrically efficient when computed from adaptively collected trajectories. The canonical gradient has a martingale form, and directional stability guarantees stabilization of its predictable quadratic variation, enabling high-dimensional asymptotic normality. We characterize efficiency using a convolution theorem for the adaptive-data setting, and give a condition under which the one-step estimator attains the efficiency bound. We verify directional stability for LinUCB, yielding the first semiparametric efficiency guarantee for a regular scalar target under LinUCB sampling.",

    "abstract": "A key challenge in translating Visual Place Recognition (VPR) from the lab to long-term deployment is ensuring a priori that a system can meet user-specified performance requirements across different parts of an environment, rather than just on average globally. A critical mechanism for controlling local VPR performance is the density of the reference mapping database, yet this factor is largely neglected in existing work, where benchmark datasets with fixed, engineering-driven (sensors, storage, GPS frequency) sampling densities are typically used. In this paper, we propose a dynamic VPR mapping approach that uses pairs of reference traverses from the target environment to automatically select an appropriate map density to satisfy two user-defined requirements: (1) a target Local Recall@1 level, and (2) the proportion of the operational environment over which this requirement must be met or exceeded, which we term the Recall Achievement Rate (RAR). Our approach is based on the hypothesis that match patterns between multiple reference traverses, evaluated across different map densities, can be modelled to predict the density required to meet these performance targets on unseen deployment data. Through extensive experiments across multiple VPR methods and the Nordland and Oxford RobotCar benchmarks, we show that our system consistently achieves or exceeds the specified local recall level over at least the user-specified proportion of the environment. Comparisons with alternative baselines demonstrate that our approach reliably selects the correct operating point in map density, avoiding unnecessary over-densification. Finally, ablation studies and analysis evaluate sensitivity to reference map choice and local space definitions, and reveal that conventional global Recall@1 is a poor predictor of the often more operationally meaningful RAR metric.",

    "abstract": "Discrete diffusion models have emerged as strong alternatives to autoregressive language models, with recent work initializing and fine-tuning a base unimodal model for bimodal generation. Diverging from previous approaches, we introduce the first tri-modal masked diffusion model pretrained from scratch on text, image-text, and audio-text data. We systematically analyze multimodal scaling laws, modality mixing ratios, noise schedules, and batch-size effects, and we provide optimized inference sampling defaults. Our batch-size analysis yields a novel stochastic differential equation (SDE)-based reparameterization that eliminates the need for tuning the optimal batch size as reported in recent work. This reparameterization decouples the physical batch size, often chosen based on compute constraints (GPU saturation, FLOP efficiency, wall-clock time), from the logical batch size, chosen to balance gradient variance during stochastic optimization. Finally, we pretrain a preliminary 3B-parameter tri-modal model on 6.4T tokens, demonstrating the capabilities of a unified design and achieving strong results in text generation, text-to-image tasks, and text-to-speech tasks. Our work represents the largest-scale systematic open study of multimodal discrete diffusion models conducted to date, providing insights into scaling behaviors across multiple modalities.",

    "abstract": "We ask when a normal-form game yields a single equilibrium prediction, even if players can coordinate by delegating play to an intermediary such as a platform or a cartel. Delegation outcomes are modeled via coarse correlated equilibria (CCE) when the intermediary cannot punish deviators, and via the set of individually rational correlated profiles (IRCP) when it can. We characterize games in which the IRCP or the CCE is unique, uncovering a structural link between these solution concepts. Our analysis also provides new conditions for the uniqueness of classical correlated and Nash equilibria that do not rely on the existence of dominant strategies. The resulting equilibria are robust to players' information about the environment, payoff perturbations, pre-play communication, equilibrium selection, and learning dynamics. We apply these results to collusion-proof mechanism design.",

    "abstract": "Data assimilation and scientific inverse problems require reconstructing high-dimensional physical states from sparse and noisy observations, ideally with uncertainty-aware posterior samples that remain faithful to learned priors and governing physics. While training-free conditional generation is well developed for diffusion models, corresponding conditioning and posterior sampling strategies for Flow Matching (FM) priors remain comparatively under-explored, especially on scientific benchmarks where fidelity must be assessed beyond measurement misfit. In this work, we study training-free conditional generation for scientific inverse problems under FM priors and organize existing inference-time strategies by where measurement information is injected: (i) guided transport dynamics that perturb sampling trajectories using likelihood information, and (ii) source-distribution inference that performs posterior inference over the source variable while keeping the learned transport fixed. Building on the latter, we propose D-Flow SGLD, a source-space posterior sampling method that augments differentiable source inference with preconditioned stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics, enabling scalable exploration of the source posterior induced by new measurement operators without retraining the prior or modifying the learned FM dynamics. We benchmark representative methods from both families on a hierarchy of problems: 2D toy posteriors, chaotic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky trajectories, and wall-bounded turbulence reconstruction. Across these settings, we quantify trade-offs among measurement assimilation, posterior diversity, and physics/statistics fidelity, and establish D-Flow SGLD as a practical FM-compatible posterior sampler for scientific inverse problems.",

We apply the Prometheus variational autoencoder framework -- previously validated on classical (2D, 3D Ising) and quantum (disordered transverse field Ising) phase transitions -- to systematically explore the $J_1$-$J_2$ phase diagram via unsupervised analysis of exact diagonalization ground states for a $4 \\times 4$ lattice.

    "abstract": "A key challenge in artificial intelligence and neuroscience is understanding how neural systems learn representations that capture the underlying dynamics of the world. Most world models represent the transition function with unstructured neural networks, limiting interpretability, sample efficiency, and generalization to unseen states or action compositions. We address these issues with a generalizable world model grounded in Vector Symbolic Architecture (VSA) principles as geometric priors. Our approach utilizes learnable Fourier Holographic Reduced Representation (FHRR) encoders to map states and actions into a high dimensional complex vector space with learned group structure and models transitions with element-wise complex multiplication. We formalize the framework's group theoretic foundation and show how training such structured representations to be approximately invariant enables strong multi-step composition directly in latent space and generalization performances over various experiments. On a discrete grid world environment, our model achieves 87.5% zero shot accuracy to unseen state-action pairs, obtains 53.6% higher accuracy on 20-timestep horizon rollouts, and demonstrates 4x higher robustness to noise relative to an MLP baseline. These results highlight how training to have latent group structure yields generalizable, data-efficient, and interpretable world models, providing a principled pathway toward structured models for real-world planning and reasoning.",

    "abstract": "$E(3)$-equivariant neural networks have proven to be effective in a wide range of 3D modeling tasks. A fundamental operation of such networks is the tensor product, which allows interaction between different feature types. Because this operation scales poorly, there has been considerable work towards accelerating this interaction. However, recently \\citet{xieprice} have pointed out that most speedups come from a reduction in expressivity rather than true algorithmic improvements on computing Clebsch-Gordan tensor products. A modification of Gaunt tensor product \\citep{gaunt} can give a true asymptotic speedup but is incomplete and misses many interactions. In this work, we provide the first complete algorithm which truly provides asymptotic benefits Clebsch-Gordan tensor products. For full CGTP, our algorithm brings runtime complexity from the naive $O(L^6)$ to $O(L^4\\log^2 L)$, close to the lower bound of $O(L^4)$. We first show how generalizing fast Fourier based convolution naturally leads to the previously proposed Gaunt tensor product \\citep{gaunt}. To remedy antisymmetry issues, we generalize from scalar signals to irrep valued signals, giving us tensor spherical harmonics. We prove a generalized Gaunt formula for the tensor harmonics. Finally, we show that we only need up to vector valued signals to recover the missing interactions of Gaunt tensor product.",

We investigate both individual behavior and congruence among the classifiers. We find breakdown-like behavior that holds for all four classifiers, as degradation increases and they move from being mostly correct to only coincidentally correct, because they are wrong in the same way. In the process, a picture of spatial heterogeneity emerges: as the training data move farther from analysis data, classifier decisions degenerate, the boundary becomes less dense, and congruence increases.",

    "abstract": "Vector glyphs are the atomic units of digital typography, yet most learning-based pipelines still depend on carefully curated exemplar sheets and raster-to-vector postprocessing, which limits accessibility and editability. We introduce VecGlypher, a single multimodal language model that generates high-fidelity vector glyphs directly from text descriptions or image exemplars. Given a style prompt, optional reference glyph images, and a target character, VecGlypher autoregressively emits SVG path tokens, avoiding raster intermediates and producing editable, watertight outlines in one pass. A typography-aware data and training recipe makes this possible: (i) a large-scale continuation stage on 39K noisy Envato fonts to master SVG syntax and long-horizon geometry, followed by (ii) post-training on 2.5K expert-annotated Google Fonts with descriptive tags and exemplars to align language and imagery with geometry; preprocessing normalizes coordinate frames, canonicalizes paths, de-duplicates families, and quantizes coordinates for stable long-sequence decoding. On cross-family OOD evaluation, VecGlypher substantially outperforms both general-purpose LLMs and specialized vector-font baselines for text-only generation, while image-referenced generation reaches a state-of-the-art performance, with marked gains over DeepVecFont-v2 and DualVector. Ablations show that model scale and the two-stage recipe are critical and that absolute-coordinate serialization yields the best geometry. VecGlypher lowers the barrier to font creation by letting users design with words or exemplars, and provides a scalable foundation for future multimodal design tools.",

Based on these conditions, we identify three vulnerability patterns, develop detection and attack-construction algorithms, and validate them in practice. Using the Snort intrusion detection ruleset, our evaluation identifies 45 previously unknown REwB vulnerabilities with quadratic or worse runtime. We further demonstrate practical exploits against Snort, including slowing rule evaluation by 0.6-1.2 seconds and bypassing alerts by triggering PCRE's matching limit.",

    "abstract": "Deep research has emerged as an important task that aims to address hard queries through extensive open-web exploration. To tackle it, most prior work equips large language model (LLM)-based agents with opaque web search APIs, enabling agents to iteratively issue search queries, retrieve external evidence, and reason over it. Despite search's essential role in deep research, black-box web search APIs hinder systematic analysis of search components, leaving the behaviour of established text ranking methods in deep research largely unclear. To fill this gap, we reproduce a selection of key findings and best practices for IR text ranking methods in the deep research setting. In particular, we examine their effectiveness from three perspectives: (i) retrieval units (documents vs. passages), (ii) pipeline configurations (different retrievers, re-rankers, and re-ranking depths), and (iii) query characteristics (the mismatch between agent-issued queries and the training queries of text rankers). We perform experiments on BrowseComp-Plus, a deep research dataset with a fixed corpus, evaluating 2 open-source agents, 5 retrievers, and 3 re-rankers across diverse setups. We find that agent-issued queries typically follow web-search-style syntax (e.g., quoted exact matches), favouring lexical, learned sparse, and multi-vector retrievers; passage-level units are more efficient under limited context windows, and avoid the difficulties of document length normalisation in lexical retrieval; re-ranking is highly effective; translating agent-issued queries into natural-language questions significantly bridges the query mismatch.",

    "abstract": "Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can be interpreted as discrete-time state-space models, where the state evolution corresponds to an infinite-impulse-response (IIR) filtering operation governed by both feedforward weights and recurrent poles. While, in principle, all parameters including pole locations can be optimized via backpropagation through time (BPTT), such joint learning incurs substantial computational overhead and is often impractical for applications with limited training data. Echo state networks (ESNs) mitigate this limitation by fixing the recurrent dynamics and training only a linear readout, enabling efficient and stable online adaptation. In this work, we analytically and empirically examine why learning recurrent poles does not provide tangible benefits in data-constrained, real-time learning scenarios. Our analysis shows that pole learning renders the weight optimization problem highly non-convex, requiring significantly more training samples and iterations for gradient-based methods to converge to meaningful solutions. Empirically, we observe that for complex-valued data, gradient descent frequently exhibits prolonged plateaus, and advanced optimizers offer limited improvement. In contrast, fixed-pole architectures induce stable and well-conditioned state representations even with limited training data. Numerical results demonstrate that fixed-pole networks achieve superior performance with lower training complexity, making them more suitable for online real-time tasks.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: Deep learning-based segmentation models are increasingly integrated into clinical imaging workflows, yet their robustness to adversarial perturbations remains incompletely characterized, particularly for ultrasound images. We evaluated adversarial attacks and inference-time defenses for thyroid nodule segmentation in B-mode ultrasound. Methods: Two black-box adversarial attacks were developed: (1) Structured Speckle Amplification Attack (SSAA), which injects boundary-targeted noise, and (2) Frequency-Domain Ultrasound Attack (FDUA), which applies bandpass-filtered phase perturbations in the Fourier domain. Three inference-time mitigations were evaluated on adversarial images: randomized preprocessing with test-time augmentation, deterministic input denoising, and stochastic ensemble inference with consistency-aware aggregation. Experiments were conducted on a U-Net segmentation model trained on cine-clips from a database of 192 thyroid nodules. Results: The baseline model achieved a mean Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.76 (SD 0.20) on unperturbed images. SSAA reduced DSC by 0.29 (SD 0.20) while maintaining high visual similarity (SSIM = 0.94). FDUA resulted in a smaller DSC reduction of 0.11 (SD 0.09) with lower visual fidelity (SSIM = 0.82). Against SSAA, all three defenses significantly improved DSC after correction, with deterministic denoising showing the largest recovery (+0.10, p < 0.001), followed by randomized preprocessing (+0.09, p < 0.001), and stochastic ensemble inference (+0.08, p = 0.002). No defense achieved statistically significant improvement against FDUA. Conclusion: Spatial-domain adversarial perturbations in ultrasound segmentation showed partial mitigation with input preprocessing, whereas frequency-domain perturbations were not mitigated by the defenses, highlighting modality-specific challenges in adversarial robustness evaluation.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel vector field strategy for controlling fully-actuated systems on connected matrix Lie groups, ensuring convergence to and traversal along a curve defined on the group. Our approach generalizes our previous work (Rezende et al., 2022) and reduces to it when considering the Lie group of translations in Euclidean space. Since the proofs in Rezende et al. (2022) rely on key properties such as the orthogonality between the convergent and traversal components, we extend these results by leveraging Lie group properties. These properties also allow the control input to be non-redundant, meaning it matches the dimension of the Lie group, rather than the potentially larger dimension of the space in which the group is embedded. This can lead to more practical control inputs in certain scenarios. A particularly notable application of our strategy is in controlling systems on SE(3) -- in this case, the non-redundant input corresponds to the object's mechanical twist -- making it well-suited for controlling objects that can move and rotate freely, such as omnidirectional drones. In this case, we provide an efficient algorithm to compute the vector field. We experimentally validate the proposed method using a robotic manipulator to demonstrate its effectiveness.",

We introduce MMA-RAG^T, an inference-time control framework governed by a Modular Trust Agent (MTA) that maintains an approximate belief state via structured LLM reasoning. Operating as a model-agnostic overlay, MMA-RAGT mediates a configurable set of internal checkpoints to enforce stateful defence-in-depth. Extensive evaluation on 43,774 instances demonstrates a 6.50x average reduction factor in Attack Success Rate relative to undefended baselines, with negligible utility cost. Crucially, a factorial ablation validates our theoretical bounds: while statefulness and spatial coverage are individually necessary (26.4 pp and 13.6 pp gains respectively), stateless multi-point intervention can yield zero marginal benefit under homogeneous stateless filtering when checkpoint detections are perfectly correlated.",

    "abstract": "Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) offers a computationally efficient paradigm for neuromorphic learning. Yet, it lacks rigorous uncertainty quantification, leading to open decision boundaries and, consequently, vulnerability to outliers, adversarial perturbations, and out-of-distribution inputs. To address these limitations, we introduce ConformalHDC, a unified framework that combines the statistical guarantees of conformal prediction with the computational efficiency of HDC. For this framework, we propose two complementary variations. First, the set-valued formulation provides finite-sample, distribution-free coverage guarantees. Using carefully designed conformity scores, it forms enclosed decision boundaries that improve robustness to non-conforming inputs. Second, the point-valued formulation leverages the same conformity scores to produce a single prediction when desired, potentially improving accuracy over traditional HDC by accounting for class interactions. We demonstrate the broad applicability of the proposed framework through evaluations on multiple real-world datasets. In particular, we apply our method to the challenging problem of decoding non-spatial stimulus information from the spiking activity of hippocampal neurons recorded as subjects performed a sequence memory task. Our results show that ConformalHDC not only accurately decodes the stimulus information represented in the neural activity data, but also provides rigorous uncertainty estimates and correctly abstains when presented with data from other behavioral states. Overall, these capabilities position the framework as a reliable, uncertainty-aware foundation for neuromorphic computing.",

    "abstract": "Action chunking has recently emerged as a standard practice in flow-based Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. However, the effect and choice of the execution horizon - the number of actions to be executed from each predicted chunk - remains underexplored. In this work, we first show that varying the execution horizon leads to substantial performance deviations, with performance initially improving and then declining as the horizon increases. To uncover the reasons, we analyze the cross- and self-attention weights in flow-based VLAs and reveal two key phenomena: (i) intra-chunk actions attend invariantly to vision-language tokens, limiting adaptability to environmental changes; and (ii) the initial and terminal action tokens serve as stable anchors, forming latent centers around which intermediate actions are organized. Motivated by these insights, we interpret action self-attention weights as a proxy for the model's predictive limit and propose AutoHorizon, the first test-time method that dynamically estimates the execution horizon for each predicted action chunk to adapt to changing perceptual conditions. Across simulated and real-world robotic manipulation tasks, AutoHorizon is performant, incurs negligible computational overhead, and generalizes across diverse tasks and flow-based models.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a sequence modeling framework in which the latent state is a complex-valued wave function evolving on a finite-dimensional Hilbert space under a learned, time-dependent Hamiltonian. Unlike standard recurrent architectures that rely on gating mechanisms to suppress competing hypotheses, our framework utilizes quantum interference: the Hamiltonian steers the phases of complex amplitudes so that conflicting interpretations cancel while compatible ones reinforce. The dynamics are strictly unitary, ensuring that the state norm is preserved exactly at every time step via a Cayley (Crank--Nicolson) discretization. Token probabilities are extracted using the Born rule, a quadratic measurement operator that couples magnitudes and relative phases. Our primary theoretical contribution is a separation theorem characterizing the representational advantage of this readout: we define a family of disambiguation tasks that a complex unitary model of dimension $N$ solves exactly, but which requires a state dimension of $Ω(N^2)$ for any real-valued orthogonal model equipped with a standard affine-softmax readout. This quadratic gap arises because the Born rule implicitly lifts the $N$-dimensional state into the space of rank-one Hermitian matrices, accessing pairwise phase correlations that are inaccessible to linear projections. Finally, we derive a continuity equation for the latent probability mass, yielding conserved pairwise currents that serve as a built-in diagnostic for tracing information flow between dimensions.",

Prior efforts often rely on heuristic penalties, post-hoc correction, or generic decoding tweaks, which do not directly intervene in the mechanisms that trigger object hallucination and thus yield limited gains. To address this challenge, we propose a causal decoding framework that applies targeted causal interventions during generation to curb spurious object mentions. By reshaping the decoding dynamics to attenuate spurious dependencies, our approach reduces false object tokens while maintaining descriptive quality. Across captioning and QA benchmarks, our framework substantially lowers object-hallucination rates and achieves state-of-the-art faithfulness without degrading overall output quality.",

Our main contribution is the design of an uncoupled learning algorithm that guarantees last-iterate convergence to the Nash equilibrium with high probability. We establish a convergence rate of $\\tilde{O}(T^{-1/4})$ up to polynomial factors in problem parameters. Crucially, our proposed algorithm is computationally efficient, requiring only an efficient linear optimization oracle over the players' compact action sets.

    "abstract": "Unified Vision-Language Models (UVLMs) aim to advance multimodal learning by supporting both understanding and generation within a single framework. However, existing approaches largely focus on architectural unification while overlooking the need for explicit interaction between the two capabilities during task solving. As a result, current models treat understanding and generation as parallel skills rather than synergistic processes. To achieve real synergy, we introduce the interleaved Analyzing-Drafting problem-solving loop (AD-Loop), a new think paradigm that dynamically alternates between analytic and drafting operations. By interleaving textual thoughts with visual thoughts, AD-Loop enables models to iteratively refine both comprehension and outputs, fostering genuine synergy. To train this mechanism, we design a two-stage strategy: supervised learning on interleaved thought data to initialize alternation, followed by reinforcement learning to promote adaptive and autonomous control. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AD-Loop consistently improves performance across standard benchmarks for both understanding and generation, with strong transferability to various UVLMs architectures. Visual analyses further validate the effectiveness of implicit visual thoughts. These results highlight AD-Loop as a principled and broadly applicable strategy for synergizing comprehension and creation. The project page is at https://sqwu.top/AD-Loop.",

    "abstract": "Flow-based generative models, such as diffusion models and flow matching models, have achieved remarkable success in learning complex data distributions. However, a critical gap remains for their deployment in safety-critical domains: the lack of formal guarantees that generated samples will satisfy hard constraints. We address this by proposing a safety filtering framework that acts as an online shield for any pre-trained generative model. Our key insight is to cooperate with the generative process rather than override it. We define a constricting safety tube that is relaxed at the initial noise distribution and progressively tightens to the target safe set at the final data distribution, mirroring the coarse-to-fine structure of the generative process itself. By characterizing this tube via Control Barrier Functions (CBFs), we synthesize a feedback control input through a convex Quadratic Program (QP) at each sampling step. As the tube is loosest when noise is high and intervention is cheapest in terms of control energy, most constraint enforcement occurs when it least disrupts the model's learned structure. We prove that this mechanism guarantees safe sampling while minimizing the distributional shift from the original model at each sampling step, as quantified by the KL divergence. Our framework applies to any pre-trained flow-based generative scheme requiring no retraining or architectural modifications. We validate the approach across constrained image generation, physically-consistent trajectory sampling, and safe robotic manipulation policies, achieving 100% constraint satisfaction while preserving semantic fidelity.",

Across six medical VLMs, we measure yes/no flips for the same image and find flip rates from 8% to 58%. However, low flip rate does not imply visual grounding: text-only baselines show that some models stay consistent even when the image is removed, suggesting they rely on language priors. To study mechanisms in one model, we apply GemmaScope 2 Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to MedGemma 4B and analyze FlipBank, a curated set of 158 flip cases. We identify a sparse feature at layer 17 that correlates with prompt framing and predicts decision margin shifts. In causal patching, removing this feature's contribution recovers 45% of the yesminus-no logit margin on average and fully reverses 15% of flips. Acting on this finding, we show that clamping the identified feature at inference reduces flip rates by 31% relative with only a 1.3 percentage-point accuracy cost, while also decreasing text-prior reliance. These results suggest that flip rate alone is not enough; robustness evaluations should test both paraphrase stability and image reliance.",

Our method belongs to the family of independence Metropolis-Hastings (IMH) sampling algorithms, which are common in Bayesian inference. Relying on the existence of an approximate posterior distribution that is cheaper to sample from but may have significant bias, we introduce Proximal-IMH, a scheme that removes this bias by correcting samples from the approximate posterior through an auxiliary optimization problem. This yields a local adjustment that trades off adherence to the exact model against stability around the approximate reference point. For idealized settings, we prove that the proximal correction tightens the match between approximate and exact posteriors, thereby improving acceptance rates and mixing. The method applies to both linear and nonlinear input-output operators and is particularly suitable for inverse problems where exact posterior sampling is too expensive. We present numerical experiments including multimodal and data-driven priors with nonlinear input-output operators. The results show that Proximal-IMH reliably outperforms existing IMH variants.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) agents under partial observability often condition actions on internally accumulated information such as memory or inferred latent context. We formalise such information-conditioned interaction patterns as behavioural dependency: variation in action selection with respect to internal information under fixed observations. This induces a probe-relative notion of $ε$-behavioural equivalence and a within-policy behavioural distance that quantifies probe sensitivity. We establish three structural results. First, the set of policies exhibiting non-trivial behavioural dependency is not closed under convex aggregation. Second, behavioural distance contracts under convex combination. Third, we prove a sufficient local condition under which gradient ascent on a skewed mixture objective decreases behavioural distance when a dominant-mode gradient aligns with the direction of steepest contraction. Minimal bandit and partially observable gridworld experiments provide controlled witnesses of these mechanisms. In the examined settings, behavioural distance decreases under convex aggregation and under continued optimisation with skewed latent priors, and in these experiments it precedes degradation under latent prior shift. These results identify structural conditions under which probe-conditioned behavioural separation is not preserved under common policy transformations.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has become the leading paradigm for enhancing reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, standard RLVR algorithms suffer from a well-documented pathology: while they improve Pass@1 accuracy through sharpened sampling, they simultaneously narrow the model's reasoning boundary and reduce generation diversity. We identify a root cause that existing methods overlook: the uniform penalization of errors. Current approaches -- whether data-filtering methods that select prompts by difficulty, or advantage normalization schemes -- treat all incorrect rollouts within a group identically. We show that this uniformity allows overconfident errors (incorrect reasoning paths that the RL process has spuriously reinforced) to persist and monopolize probability mass, ultimately suppressing valid exploratory trajectories. To address this, we propose the Asymmetric Confidence-aware Error Penalty (ACE). ACE introduces a per-rollout confidence shift metric, c_i = log(pi_theta(y_i|x) / pi_ref(y_i|x)), to dynamically modulate negative advantages. Theoretically, we demonstrate that ACE's gradient can be decomposed into the gradient of a selective regularizer restricted to overconfident errors, plus a well-characterized residual that partially moderates the regularizer's strength. We conduct extensive experiments fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Math-7B, Qwen3-8B-Base, and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct on the DAPO-Math-17K dataset using GRPO and DAPO within the VERL framework. Evaluated on MATH-500 and AIME 2025, ACE composes seamlessly with existing methods and consistently improves the full Pass@k spectrum across all three model families and benchmarks.",

    "abstract": "This work presents a wearable human activity recognition (HAR) system that performs real-time inference directly inside a shank-mounted inertial measurement unit (IMU) to support low-latency control of a lower-limb exoskeleton. Unlike conventional approaches that continuously stream raw inertial data to a microcontroller for classification, the proposed system executes activity recognition at the sensor level using the embedded Machine Learning Core (MLC) of the STMicroelectronics LSM6DSV16X IMU, allowing the host microcontroller to remain in a low-power state and read only the recognized activity label from IMU registers. While the system generalizes to multiple human activities, this paper focuses on three representative locomotion modes - stance, level walking, and stair ascent - using data collected from adult participants. A lightweight decision-tree model was configured and deployed for on-sensor execution using ST MEMS Studio, enabling continuous operation without custom machine learning code on the microcontroller. During operation, the IMU asserts an interrupt when motion or a new classification is detected; the microcontroller wakes, reads the MLC output registers, and forwards the inferred mode to the exoskeleton controller. This interrupt-driven, on-sensor inference architecture reduces computation and communication overhead while preserving battery energy and improving robustness in distinguishing level walking from stair ascent for torque-assist control.",

Existing multimodal models achieve strong results when generating SVGs from clean renderings or textual descriptions, but they fall short in real-world scenarios where natural images introduce noise, clutter, and domain shifts. A central challenge in this direction is the lack of suitable benchmarks. To address this need, we introduce the WildSVG Benchmark, formed by two complementary datasets: Natural WildSVG, built from real images containing company logos paired with their SVG annotations, and Synthetic WildSVG, which blends complex SVG renderings into real scenes to simulate difficult conditions. Together, these resources provide the first foundation for systematic benchmarking SVG extraction. We benchmark state-of-the-art multimodal models and find that current approaches perform well below what is needed for reliable SVG extraction in real scenarios.

    "title": "Benchmarking State Space Models, Transformers, and Recurrent Networks for US Grid Forecasting",
    "abstract": "Selecting the right deep learning model for power grid forecasting is challenging, as performance heavily depends on the data available to the operator. This paper presents a comprehensive benchmark of five modern neural architectures: two state space models (PowerMamba, S-Mamba), two Transformers (iTransformer, PatchTST), and a traditional LSTM. We evaluate these models on hourly electricity demand across six diverse US power grids for forecast windows between 24 and 168 hours. To ensure a fair comparison, we adapt each model with specialized temporal processing and a modular layer that cleanly integrates weather covariates. Our results reveal that there is no single best model for all situations. When forecasting using only historical load, PatchTST and the state space models provide the highest accuracy. However, when explicit weather data is added to the inputs, the rankings reverse: iTransformer improves its accuracy three times more efficiently than PatchTST. By controlling for model size, we confirm that this advantage stems from the architecture's inherent ability to mix information across different variables. Extending our evaluation to solar generation, wind power, and wholesale prices further demonstrates that model rankings depend on the forecast task: PatchTST excels on highly rhythmic signals like solar, while state space models are better suited for the chaotic fluctuations of wind and price. Ultimately, this benchmark provides grid operators with actionable guidelines for selecting the optimal forecasting architecture based on their specific data environments.",

    "title": "General Convex Agreement with Near-Optimal Communication",
    "abstract": "Convex Agreement (CA) strengthens Byzantine Agreement (BA) by requiring the output agreed upon to lie in the convex hull of the honest parties' inputs. This validity condition is motivated by practical aggregation tasks (e.g., robust learning or sensor fusion) where honest inputs need not coincide but should still constrain the decision. CA inherits BA lower bounds, and optimal synchronous round complexity is easy to obtain (e.g., via Byzantine Broadcast). The main challenge is \\emph{communication}: standard approaches for CA have a communication complexity of $Θ(Ln^2)$ for large $L$-bit inputs, leaving a gap in contrast to BA's lower bound of $Ω(Ln)$ bits. While recent work achieves optimal communication complexity of $O(Ln)$ for sufficiently large $L$ [GLW,PODC'25], translating this result to general convexity spaces remained an open problem.   We investigate this gap for abstract convexity spaces, and we present deterministic synchronous CA protocols with near-optimal communication complexity: when $L = Ω(n \\cdot κ)$, where $κ$ is a security parameter, we achieve $O(L\\cdot n\\log n)$ communication for finite convexity spaces and $O(L\\cdot n^{1+o(1)})$ communication for Euclidean spaces $\\mathbb{R}^d$. Our protocols have asymptotically optimal round complexity $O(n)$ and, when a bound on the inputs' lengths $L$ is fixed a priori, we achieve near-optimal resilience $t < n/(ω+\\varepsilon)$ for any constant $\\varepsilon>0$, where $ω$ is the Helly number of the convexity space. If $L$ is unknown, we still achieve resilience $t<n/(ω+\\varepsilon+1)$ for any constant $\\varepsilon > 0$. We further note that our protocols can be leveraged to efficiently solve parallel BA.   Our main technical contribution is the use of extractor graphs to obtain a deterministic assignment of parties to committees, which is resilient against adaptive adversaries.",

We propose Generative Bayesian Computation (GBC) via Implicit Quantile Networks (IQNs) as a surrogate framework that targets all three limitations. GBC learns the full conditional quantile function from input--output pairs; at test time, a single forward pass per quantile level produces draws from the predictive distribution.   Across fourteen benchmarks we compare GBC to four GP-based methods. GBC improves CRPS by 11--26\\% on piecewise jump-process benchmarks, by 14\\% on a ten-dimensional Friedman function, and scales linearly to 90,000 training points where dense-covariance GPs are infeasible. A boundary-augmented variant matches or outperforms Modular Jump GPs on two-dimensional jump datasets (up to 46\\% CRPS improvement). In active learning, a randomized-prior IQN ensemble achieves nearly three times lower RMSE than deep GP active learning on Rocket LGBB. Overall, GBC records a favorable point estimate in 12 of 14 comparisons. GPs retain an edge on smooth surfaces where their smoothness prior provides effective regularization.",

Beyond proposing OVTAS, we present a systematic study across 14 diverse VLMs, providing the first broad analysis of their suitability for open-vocabulary action segmentation.

    "abstract": "A central premise in evolutionary biology is that individual variation can generate information asymmetries that facilitate the emergence of hierarchical organisation. To examine this process, we develop an agent-based model (ABM) to identify the minimal conditions under which hierarchy arises in dynamic multi-agent systems, focusing on the roles of initial heterogeneity and mutation amplitude across generations. Hierarchical organisation is quantified using the Trophic Incoherence (TI) metric, which captures directional asymmetries in interaction networks. Our results show that even small individual differences can be amplified through repeated local interactions involving reproduction, competition, and cooperation, but that hierarchical order is markedly more sensitive to mutation amplitude than to initial heterogeneity. Across repeated trials, stable hierarchies reliably emerge only when mutation amplitude is sufficiently high, while initial heterogeneity primarily affects early formation rather than long-term persistence. Overall, these findings demonstrate how simple interaction rules can give rise to both the emergence and persistence of hierarchical organisation, providing a quantitative account of how structured inequality can develop from initially homogeneous populations.",

    "abstract": "The boundary of the firm is determined by coordination cost. We argue that agentic AI induces a structural change in how coordination costs scale: in prior modular systems, integration cost grew with interaction topology (O(n^2) in the number of components); in protocol-mediated agentic systems, integration cost collapses to O(n) while verification scales with task throughput rather than interaction count. This shift selects for a specific organizational equilibrium -- the Headless Firm -- structured as an hourglass: a personalized generative interface at the top, a standardized protocol waist in the middle, and a competitive market of micro-specialized execution agents at the bottom. We formalize this claim as a coordination cost model with two falsifiable empirical predictions: (1) the marginal cost of adding an execution provider should be approximately constant in a mature hourglass ecosystem; (2) the ratio of total coordination cost to task throughput should remain stable as ecosystem size grows. We derive conditions for hourglass stability versus re-centralization and analyze implications for firm size distributions, labor markets, and software economics. The analysis predicts a domain-conditional Great Unbundling: in high knowledge-velocity domains, firm size distributions shift mass from large integrated incumbents toward micro-specialized agents and thin protocol orchestrators.",

    "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across multiple clients without sharing their private data. However, data heterogeneity across clients leads to client drift, which degrades the overall generalization performance of the model. This effect is further compounded by overemphasis on poorly performing clients. To address this problem, we propose FedVG, a novel gradient-based federated aggregation framework that leverages a global validation set to guide the optimization process. Such a global validation set can be established using readily available public datasets, ensuring accessibility and consistency across clients without compromising privacy. In contrast to conventional approaches that prioritize client dataset volume, FedVG assesses the generalization ability of client models by measuring the magnitude of validation gradients across layers. Specifically, we compute layerwise gradient norms to derive a client-specific score that reflects how much each client needs to adjust for improved generalization on the global validation set, thereby enabling more informed and adaptive federated aggregation. Extensive experiments on both natural and medical image benchmarking datasets, across diverse model architectures, demonstrate that FedVG consistently improves performance, particularly in highly heterogeneous settings. Moreover, FedVG is modular and can be seamlessly integrated with various state-of-the-art FL algorithms, often further improving their results.

    "abstract": "Prompt learning has become a dominant paradigm for adapting vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP to downstream tasks without modifying pretrained weights. While extending prompts to both vision and text encoders across multiple transformer layers significantly boosts performance, it dramatically increases the number of trainable parameters, with state-of-the-art methods requiring millions of parameters and abandoning the parameter efficiency that makes prompt tuning attractive. In this work, we propose \\textbf{MMLoP} (\\textbf{M}ulti-\\textbf{M}odal \\textbf{Lo}w-Rank \\textbf{P}rompting), a framework that achieves deep multi-modal prompting with only \\textbf{11.5K trainable parameters}, comparable to early text-only methods like CoOp. MMLoP parameterizes vision and text prompts at each transformer layer through a low-rank factorization, which serves as an implicit regularizer against overfitting on few-shot training data. To further close the accuracy gap with state-of-the-art methods, we introduce three complementary components: a self-regulating consistency loss that anchors prompted representations to frozen zero-shot CLIP features at both the feature and logit levels, a uniform drift correction that removes the global embedding shift induced by prompt tuning to preserve class-discriminative structure, and a shared up-projection that couples vision and text prompts through a common low-rank factor to enforce cross-modal alignment. Extensive experiments across three benchmarks and 11 diverse datasets demonstrate that MMLoP achieves a highly favorable accuracy-efficiency tradeoff, outperforming the majority of existing methods including those with orders of magnitude more parameters, while achieving a harmonic mean of 79.70\\% on base-to-novel generalization.",

    "abstract": "Multimodal learning that integrates genomics and histopathology has shown strong potential in cancer diagnosis, yet its clinical translation is hindered by the limited availability of paired histology-genomics data. Knowledge distillation (KD) offers a practical solution by transferring genomic supervision into histopathology models, enabling accurate inference using histology alone. However, existing KD methods rely on batch-local alignment, which introduces instability due to limited within-batch comparisons and ultimately degrades performance.   To address these limitations, we propose Momentum Memory Knowledge Distillation (MoMKD), a cross-modal distillation framework driven by a momentum-updated memory. This memory aggregates genomic and histopathology information across batches, effectively enlarging the supervisory context available to each mini-batch. Furthermore, we decouple the gradients of the genomics and histology branches, preventing genomic signals from dominating histology feature learning during training and eliminating the modality-gap issue at inference time.   Extensive experiments on the TCGA-BRCA benchmark (HER2, PR, and ODX classification tasks) and an independent in-house testing dataset demonstrate that MoMKD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MIL and multimodal KD baselines, delivering strong performance and generalization under histology-only inference.

On two public datasets, MPA outperforms three state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines, improving recall by 13.6%. To better reflect realistic, user-facing phishing detection performance, we further evaluate MPA on a benchmark of real-world suspicious URLs actively crawled from five social media platforms, where it improves recall by 20%. Detailed analysis shows episodic memory contributes up to 27% recall gain without introducing additional computational overhead. The ablation study confirms the necessity of the agent-based approach compared to prompt-based baselines and validates the effectiveness of our tool design. Finally, MPA is deployed in production, processing 60K targeted high-risk URLs weekly, and achieving 91.44% recall, providing proactive protection for millions of customers.

During off-tether experiments, we demonstrate safe navigation around obstacles (91\\% success rate in the aquarium exhibit) and introduce a low-compute onboard tracking mode.

Under the additive noise model $Y = f(X) + \\varepsilon$ with $\\varepsilon \\perp X$ and $f$ nonlinear and injective, we establish a formal asymmetry: in the reverse direction, residuals remain statistically dependent on the input regardless of approximation quality, inducing a strictly higher irreducible loss floor and non-separable gradient noise in the optimization dynamics, so that the reverse model requires strictly more gradient steps in expectation to reach any fixed loss threshold; consequently, the forward (causal) direction converges in fewer expected optimization steps. CCA operates in optimization-time space, distinguishing it from methods such as RESIT, IGCI, and SkewScore that rely on statistical independence or distributional asymmetries, and proper z-scoring of both variables is required for valid comparison of convergence rates. On synthetic benchmarks, CCA achieves 26/30 correct causal identifications across six neural architectures, including 30/30 on sine and exponential data-generating processes. We further embed CCA into a broader framework termed Causal Compression Learning (CCL), which integrates graph structure learning, causal information compression, and policy optimization, with all theoretical guarantees formally proved and empirically validated on synthetic datasets.",

Researchers have worked to map the concept of cryptographic indistinguishability to logic locking, as indistinguishability provides strong security guarantees. In an effort to bridge theory and practice, we highlight recent efforts that can be used to analyze the indistinguishability of logic locking techniques, and propose a new method of evaluation based on comparing distributions of $k$-cuts, which is akin to comparing against a library of sub-functions. We evaluate our approach on several different classes of logic locking and show up to 92% average accuracy in correctly identifying which design was locked, even in the presence of resynthesis, suggesting that the evaluated locks do not provide indistinguishability.",

Through targeted adaptation, this model family achieves state-of-the-art results on Catalan- and Spanish-specific tasks, while establishing robust performance across specialized biomedical and legal domains. To bridge the gap between research and production, we incorporate Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL), enabling flexible vector sizing that significantly reduces inference and storage costs. Ultimately, the MrBERT family demonstrates that modern encoder architectures can be optimized for both localized linguistic excellence and efficient, high-stakes domain specialization.

    "abstract": "Tokenization and sub-tokenization based models like word2vec, BERT and the GPTs are the state-of-the-art in natural language processing. Typically, these approaches have limitations with respect to their input representation. They fail to fully capture orthographic similarities and morphological variations, especially in highly inflected and under-resource languages. To mitigate this problem, we propose to computes word vectors directly from character strings, integrating both semantic and syntactic information. We denote this transformer-based approach Rich Character Embeddings (RCE). Furthermore, we propose a hybrid model that combines transformer and convolutional mechanisms. Both vector representations can be used as a drop-in replacement for dictionary- and subtoken-based word embeddings in existing model architectures. It has the potential to improve performance for both large context-based language models like BERT and small models like word2vec for under-resourced and morphologically rich languages. We evaluate our approach on various tasks like the SWAG, declension prediction for inflected languages, metaphor and chiasmus detection for various languages. Our experiments show that it outperforms traditional token-based approaches on limited data using OddOneOut and TopK metrics.",

    "abstract": "Extracting clinical information from medical transcripts in low-resource languages remains a significant challenge in healthcare natural language processing (NLP). This study evaluates a two-step pipeline combining Aya-expanse-8B as a Persian-to-English translation model with five open-source small language models (SLMs) -- Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct, and Gemma-3-1B-it -- for binary extraction of 13 clinical features from 1,221 anonymized Persian transcripts collected at a cancer palliative care call center. Using a few-shot prompting strategy without fine-tuning, models were assessed on macro-averaged F1-score, Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), sensitivity, and specificity to account for class imbalance. Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct achieved the highest overall performance (median macro-F1: 0.899; MCC: 0.797), while Gemma-3-1B-it showed the weakest results. Larger models (7B--8B parameters) consistently outperformed smaller counterparts in sensitivity and MCC. A bilingual analysis of Aya-expanse-8B revealed that translating Persian transcripts to English improved sensitivity, reduced missing outputs, and boosted metrics robust to class imbalance, though at the cost of slightly lower specificity and precision. Feature-level results showed reliable extraction of physiological symptoms across most models, whereas psychological complaints, administrative requests, and complex somatic features remained challenging. These findings establish a practical, privacy-preserving blueprint for deploying open-source SLMs in multilingual clinical NLP settings with limited infrastructure and annotation resources, and highlight the importance of jointly optimizing model scale and input language strategy for sensitive healthcare applications.",

    "abstract": "Despite strong performance in audio perception tasks, large audio-language models (AudioLLMs) remain opaque to interpretation. A major factor behind this lack of interpretability is that individual neurons in these models frequently activate in response to several unrelated concepts. We introduce the first mechanistic interpretability framework for AudioLLMs, leveraging sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to disentangle polysemantic activations into monosemantic features. Our pipeline identifies representative audio clips, assigns meaningful names via automated captioning, and validates concepts through human evaluation and steering. Experiments show that AudioLLMs encode structured and interpretable features, enhancing transparency and control. This work provides a foundation for trustworthy deployment in high-stakes domains and enables future extensions to larger models, multilingual audio, and more fine-grained paralinguistic features.

    "abstract": "Model merging under unseen test-time distribution shifts often renders naive strategies, such as mean averaging unreliable. This challenge is especially acute in medical imaging, where models are fine-tuned locally at clinics on private data, producing domain-specific models that differ by scanner, protocol, and population. When deployed at an unseen clinical site, test cases arrive in unlabeled, non-i.i.d. batches, and the model must adapt immediately without labels. In this work, we introduce an entropy-adaptive, fully online model-merging method that yields a batch-specific merged model via only forward passes, effectively leveraging target information. We further demonstrate why mean merging is prone to failure and misaligned under heterogeneous domain shifts. Next, we mitigate encoder classifier mismatch by decoupling the encoder and classification head, merging with separate merging coefficients. We extensively evaluate our method with state-of-the-art baselines using two backbones across nine medical and natural-domain generalization image classification datasets, showing consistent gains across standard evaluation and challenging scenarios. These performance gains are achieved while retaining single-model inference at test-time, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.",

    "title": "Interleaved Head Attention",
    "abstract": "Multi-Head Attention (MHA) is the core computational primitive underlying modern Large Language Models (LLMs). However, MHA suffers from a fundamental linear scaling limitation: $H$ attention heads produce exactly $H$ independent attention matrices, with no communication between heads during attention computation. This becomes problematic for multi-step reasoning, where correct answers depend on aggregating evidence from multiple parts of the context and composing latent token-to-token relations over a chain of intermediate inferences. To address this, we propose Interleaved Head Attention (IHA), which enables cross-head mixing by constructing $P$ pseudo-heads per head (typically $P=H$), where each pseudo query/key/value is a learned linear combination of all $H$ original queries, keys and values respectively. Interactions between pseudo-query and pseudo-key heads induce up to $P^2$ attention patterns per head with modest parameter overhead $\\mathcal{O}(H^2P)$. We provide theory showing improved efficiency in terms of number of parameters on the synthetic Polynomial task (IHA uses $Θ(\\sqrt{k}n^2)$ parameters vs. $Θ(kn^2)$ for MHA) and on the synthetic order-sensitive CPM-3 task (IHA uses $\\lceil\\sqrt{N_{\\max}}\\rceil$ heads vs. $N_{\\max}$ for MHA). On real-world benchmarks, IHA improves Multi-Key retrieval on RULER by 10-20% (4k-16k) and, after fine-tuning for reasoning on OpenThoughts, improves GSM8K by 5.8% and MATH-500 by 2.8% (Majority Vote) over full attention.",

We answer with a reliability level -- a single number per system-task pair, derived from self-consistency sampling and conformal calibration, that serves as a black-box deployment gate with exact, finite-sample, distribution-free guarantees. Self-consistency sampling reduces uncertainty exponentially; conformal calibration guarantees correctness within 1/(n+1) of the target level, regardless of the system's errors -- made transparently visible through larger answer sets for harder questions. Weaker models earn lower reliability levels (not accuracy -- see Definition 2.4): GPT-4.1 earns 94.6% on GSM8K and 96.8% on TruthfulQA, while GPT-4.1-nano earns 89.8% on GSM8K and 66.5% on MMLU.

In this work, we develop a learning-based framework, LACE, capable of directly modeling the temporal dynamics of GNSS measurement covariance. We model the covariance evolution as an exponentially stable dynamical system where a deep neural network (DNN) learns to predict the system's process noise from environmental features through an attention mechanism. By using contraction-based stability and systematically imposing spectral constraints, we formally provide guarantees of exponential stability and smoothness for the resulting covariance dynamics. We validate our approach on an AV-24 autonomous racecar, demonstrating improved localization performance and smoother covariance estimates in challenging, GNSS-degraded environments. Our results highlight the promise of dynamically modeling the perceived uncertainty in state estimation problems that are tightly coupled with control sensitivity.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Curating large-scale datasets of operating room (OR) workflow, encompassing rare, safety-critical, or atypical events, remains operationally and ethically challenging. This data bottleneck complicates the development of ambient intelligence for detecting, understanding, and mitigating rare or safety-critical events in the OR.   Methods: This work presents an OR video diffusion framework that enables controlled synthesis of rare and safety-critical events. The framework integrates a geometric abstraction module, a conditioning module, and a fine-tuned diffusion model to first transform OR scenes into abstract geometric representations, then condition the synthesis process, and finally generate realistic OR event videos. Using this framework, we also curate a synthetic dataset to train and validate AI models for detecting near-misses of sterile-field violations.   Results: In synthesizing routine OR events, our method outperforms off-the-shelf video diffusion baselines, achieving lower FVD/LPIPS and higher SSIM/PSNR in both in- and out-of-domain datasets. Through qualitative results, we illustrate its ability for controlled video synthesis of counterfactual events. An AI model trained and validated on the generated synthetic data achieved a RECALL of 70.13% in detecting near safety-critical events. Finally, we conduct an ablation study to quantify performance gains from key design choices.   Conclusion: Our solution enables controlled synthesis of routine and rare OR events from abstract geometric representations. Beyond demonstrating its capability to generate rare and safety-critical scenarios, we show its potential to support the development of ambient intelligence models.",

Zatom-1 is a Transformer trained with a multimodal flow matching objective that jointly models discrete atom types and continuous 3D geometries. This approach supports scalable pretraining with predictable gains as model capacity increases, while enabling fast and stable sampling. We use joint generative pretraining as a universal initialization for downstream multi-task prediction of properties, energies, and forces. Empirically, Zatom-1 matches or outperforms specialized baselines on both generative and predictive benchmarks, while reducing the generative inference time by more than an order of magnitude. Our experiments demonstrate positive predictive transfer between chemical domains from joint generative pretraining: modeling materials during pretraining improves molecular property prediction accuracy.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we develop a time-series-based signed network model for dimensionality reduction in portfolio optimization, grounded in Markowitz's portfolio theory and extended to incorporate higher-order moments of asset return distributions. Unlike traditional correlation-based approaches, we construct a complete signed graph for each trading day within a specified time window, where the sign of an edge between a pair of assets is determined by the relative behavior of their log returns with respect to their mean returns. Within this framework, we introduce a combinatorial interpretation of higher-order moments, showing that maximizing skewness and minimizing kurtosis correspond to maximizing balanced triangles and balanced 4-cliques with specific signed edge configurations respectively. We establish that the latter leads to an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem, while the former is naturally guaranteed by the structural properties of the signed graph model. Based on this interpretation, we propose a dimensionality reduction method using a combinatorial formulation of the mean-variance optimization problem through a combinatorial hedge score metric for assets. The proposed framework is validated through extensive backtesting on 199 S\\&P 500 assets over a 16-year period (2006 - 2021), demonstrating the effectiveness of reduced asset universes for portfolio construction using both Markowitz optimization and equally weighted strategy.",

Extending coherent diffractive imaging to overlap-free operation on extended samples remains an open problem. Here, we extend PtychoPINN (O.

The framework couples a differentiable forward model of coherent scattering with a Poisson photon-counting likelihood; real-space overlap enters as a tunable parameter via coordinate-based grouping rather than a hard requirement. On synthetic benchmarks, reconstructions remain accurate at low counts ($\\sim\\!10^4$ photons/frame), and overlap-free single-shot reconstruction with an experimental probe reaches amplitude structural similarity (SSIM) 0.904, compared with 0.968 for overlap-constrained reconstruction. Against a data-saturated supervised model with the same backbone (16,384 training images), PtychoPINN achieves higher SSIM with only 1,024 images and generalizes to unseen illumination profiles. Per-graphics processing unit (GPU) throughput is approximately $40\\times$ that of least-squares maximum-likelihood (LSQ-ML) reconstruction at matched $128\\times128$ resolution.

When the quantity of interest varies significantly under the posterior, accurate estimates demand many samples -- a cost often prohibitive for partial differential equation-constrained problems. To address this challenge, we introduce conditional neural control variates, a modular method that learns amortized control variates from joint model-data samples to reduce the variance of MC estimators. To scale to high-dimensional problems, we leverage Stein's identity to design an architecture based on an ensemble of hierarchical coupling layers with tractable Jacobian trace computation. Training requires: (i) samples from the joint distribution of unknown parameters and observed data; and (ii) the posterior score function, which can be computed from physics-based likelihood evaluations, neural operator surrogates, or learned generative models such as conditional normalizing flows. Once trained, the control variates generalize across observations without retraining. We validate our approach on stylized and partial differential equation-constrained Darcy flow inverse problems, demonstrating substantial variance reduction, even when the analytical score is replaced by a learned surrogate.",

    "abstract": "The rapid accumulation of Earth science data has created a significant scalability challenge; while repositories like PANGAEA host vast collections of datasets, citation metrics indicate that a substantial portion remains underutilized, limiting data reusability. Here we present PANGAEA-GPT, a hierarchical multi-agent framework designed for autonomous data discovery and analysis. Unlike standard Large Language Model (LLM) wrappers, our architecture implements a centralized Supervisor-Worker topology with strict data-type-aware routing, sandboxed deterministic code execution, and self-correction via execution feedback, enabling agents to diagnose and resolve runtime errors. Through use-case scenarios spanning physical oceanography and ecology, we demonstrate the system's capacity to execute complex, multi-step workflows with minimal human intervention. This framework provides a methodology for querying and analyzing heterogeneous repository data through coordinated agent workflows.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in alignment techniques such as Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) have improved the safety of large language models (LLMs). However, these LLMs remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that disguise harmful intent through indirect or deceptive phrasing. Using causal intervention, we empirically demonstrate that this vulnerability stems from shallow alignment mechanisms that lack deep reasoning, often rejecting harmful prompts without truly understanding why they are harmful. To mitigate this vulnerability, we propose enhancing alignment through reasoning-aware post-training. We construct and release a novel Chain-of-Thought (CoT) fine-tuning dataset that includes both utility-oriented and safety-critical prompts with step-by-step rationales. Fine-tuning on this dataset encourages models to produce principled refusals grounded in reasoning, outperforming standard SFT baselines. Furthermore, inspired by failure patterns in CoT fine-tuning, we introduce Alignment-Weighted DPO, which targets the most problematic parts of an output by assigning different preference weights to the reasoning and final-answer segments. This produces finer-grained, targeted updates than vanilla DPO and improves robustness to diverse jailbreak strategies. Extensive experiments across multiple safety and utility benchmarks show that our method consistently improves alignment robustness while maintaining overall model utility.",

    "abstract": "Multi-tracer positron emission tomography (PET) provides critical insights into diverse neuropathological processes such as tau accumulation, neuroinflammation, and $β$-amyloid deposition in the brain, making it indispensable for comprehensive neurological assessment. However, routine acquisition of multi-tracer PET is limited by high costs, radiation exposure, and restricted tracer availability. Recent efforts have explored deep learning approaches for synthesizing PET images from structural MRI. While some methods rely solely on T1-weighted MRI, others incorporate additional sequences such as T2-FLAIR to improve pathological sensitivity. However, existing methods often struggle to capture fine-grained anatomical and pathological details, resulting in artifacts and unrealistic outputs. To this end, we propose RelA-Diffusion, a Relativistic Adversarial Diffusion framework for multi-tracer PET synthesis from multi-sequence MRI. By leveraging both T1-weighted and T2-FLAIR scans as complementary inputs, RelA-Diffusion captures richer structural information to guide image generation. To improve synthesis fidelity, we introduce a gradient-penalized relativistic adversarial loss to the intermediate clean predictions of the diffusion model. This loss compares real and generated images in a relative manner, encouraging the synthesis of more realistic local structures. Both the relativistic formulation and the gradient penalty contribute to stabilizing the training, while adversarial feedback at each diffusion timestep enables consistent refinement throughout the generation process. Extensive experiments on two datasets demonstrate that RelA-Diffusion outperforms existing methods in both visual fidelity and quantitative metrics, highlighting its potential for accurate synthesis of multi-tracer PET.",

    "abstract": "Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) eliminates the need for a central aggregator, but it can expose communication patterns that reveal participant identities. This work presents UnlinkableDFL, a DFL framework that combines a peer-based mixnet with fragment-based model aggregation to ensure unlinkability in fully decentralized settings. Model updates are divided into encrypted fragments, sent over separate multi-hop paths, and aggregated without using any identity information. A theoretical analysis indicates that relay and end-to-end unlinkability improve with larger mixing sets and longer paths, while convergence remains similar to standard FedAvg. A prototype implementation evaluates learning performance, latency, unlinkability, and resource usage. The results show that UnlinkableDFL converges reliably and adapts to node churn. Communication latency emerges as the main overhead, while memory and CPU usage stay moderate. These findings illustrate the balance between anonymity and system efficiency, demonstrating that strong unlinkability can be maintained in decentralized learning workflows.",

    "title": "Archetypal Graph Generative Models: Explainable and Identifiable Communities via Anchor-Dominant Convex Hulls",
    "abstract": "Representation learning has been essential for graph machine learning tasks such as link prediction, community detection, and network visualization. Despite recent advances in achieving high performance on these downstream tasks, little progress has been made toward self-explainable models. Understanding the patterns behind predictions is equally important, motivating recent interest in explainable machine learning. In this paper, we present GraphHull, an explainable generative model that represents networks using two levels of convex hulls. At the global level, the vertices of a convex hull are treated as archetypes, each corresponding to a pure community in the network. At the local level, each community is refined by a prototypical hull whose vertices act as representative profiles, capturing community-specific variation. This two-level construction yields clear multi-scale explanations: a node's position relative to global archetypes and its local prototypes directly accounts for its edges. The geometry is well-behaved by design, while local hulls are kept disjoint by construction. To further encourage diversity and stability, we place principled priors, including determinantal point processes, and fit the model under MAP estimation with scalable subsampling. Experiments on real networks demonstrate the ability of GraphHull to recover multi-level community structure and to achieve competitive or superior performance in link prediction and community detection, while naturally providing interpretable predictions.",

Contrary to prior findings, we show that encoder-decoder architectures can be compute-optimal; we trace earlier negative results to suboptimal architectural choices and comparisons across unequal training compute budgets. Across several compute levels, we demonstrate that our encoder-decoder architecture, which we call the Scalable View Synthesis Model (SVSM), scales as effectively as decoder-only models, achieves a superior performance-compute Pareto frontier, and surpasses the previous state-of-the-art on real-world NVS benchmarks with substantially reduced training compute.",

    "abstract": "Representing the past in a compressed, efficient, and informative manner is a central problem for systems trained on sequential data. The HiPPO framework, originally proposed by Gu & Dao et al., provides a principled approach to sequential compression by projecting signals onto orthogonal polynomial (OP) bases via structured linear ordinary differential equations. Subsequent works have embedded these dynamics in state space models (SSMs), where HiPPO structure serves as an initialization. Nonlinear successors of these SSM methods such as Mamba are state-of-the-art for many tasks with long-range dependencies, but the mechanisms by which they represent and prioritize history remain largely implicit. In this work, we revisit the HiPPO framework with the goal of making these mechanisms explicit. We show how polynomial representations of history can be extended to support capabilities of modern SSMs such as adaptive allocation of memory and associative memory while retaining direct interpretability in the OP basis. We introduce a unified framework comprising five such extensions, which we collectively refer to as a \"HiPPO zoo.\" Each extension exposes a specific modeling capability through an explicit, interpretable modification of the HiPPO framework. The resulting models adapt their memory online and train in streaming settings with efficient updates. We illustrate the behaviors and modeling advantages of these extensions through a range of synthetic sequence modeling tasks, demonstrating that capabilities typically associated with modern SSMs can be realized through explicit, interpretable polynomial memory structures.",

In many such systems, adversarial interactions arise as different agents or groups compete against one another. A crucial yet often overlooked factor in existing theoretical and modeling frameworks is the random attrition of agents during operation. Effective modeling and control strategies must therefore account for both agent attrition and spatial dynamics.   Given the inherently random nature of agent survival, directly solving this problem is challenging. To address this, we propose and evaluate three approximate numerical modeling approaches in which agent survival probabilities decrease deterministically over time based on their relative positions. We apply these schemes to a scenario where agents defend a high-value unit against an attacking swarm. Our results demonstrate that these models can effectively capture the dynamics of such interactions, provided that attrition and spatial positioning are tightly integrated. These findings are relevant to a broad range of adversarial autonomy scenarios where both agent positioning and survival probabilities play a critical role.",

Gyárfás and Lehel reduced this to an extremal problem of $3$-uniform hypergraphs and proved $\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{141 \\cdot 76} \\le c_* \\le \\frac{3}{5}$. We improve both bounds by establishing $$ \\frac{9}{17} \\le c_* \\le \\frac{4}{7}, $$ where the lower bound uses a reformulation of the extremal problem, and the upper bound follows from an explicit construction together with a convenient characterization of $c_*$.",

We use this to study Dehn-filling-like quotients of various groups, among which mapping class groups of punctured spheres. In particular, we show that the mapping class group of a five-holed sphere (resp. the braid group on four strands) has infinite hyperbolic quotients (strongly) not isomorphic to hyperbolic quotients of any other given sphere mapping class group (resp. any other braid group). These quotients are obtained by modding out suitable large powers of Dehn twists, and we further argue that the corresponding quotients of the extended mapping class group have trivial outer automorphism groups. We obtain these results by studying torsion elements in the relevant quotients.",

    "abstract": "Hyperbolic (HB) programming generalizes many popular convex optimization problems, including semidefinite and second-order cone programming. Despite substantial theoretical progress on HB programming, efficient computational tools for solving large-scale hyperbolic programs remain limited. This paper presents DDS 3.0, a new release of the Domain-Driven Solver, which provides an efficient interior-point implementation tailored for hyperbolic programming. A key innovation lies in a new straight-line program (SLP) representation that enables compact representation and efficient computation of hyperbolic polynomials, their gradients, and Hessians. The SLP structure significantly reduces computational cost, allowing the Hessian to be computed in the same asymptotic complexity as the gradient through a batched reverse-over-forward differentiation scheme. We further introduce an improved corrector step for the primal-dual interior-point method, enhancing stability and convergence on convex sets where only the primal self-concordant barrier is efficiently computable. We create a comprehensive benchmark library beyond the elementary symmetric polynomials, using several different techniques. Numerical experiments demonstrate substantial performance gains of DDS 3.0 compared to first-order Frank-Wolfe algorithm, homotopy method, and SDP software utilizing SDP relaxations.",

Once regarded primarily as foundational curiosities, these effects are now understood as key operational resources for quantum computation, communication, and simulation. Although traditionally investigated in distinct settings, recent theoretical and experimental advances have revealed deep conceptual, mathematical, and operational connections between them. This review presents a unified perspective on these developments based on sheaf-theoretic and graph-theoretic frameworks, which provide theory-independent characterizations of statistical correlations. These approaches clarify the structural relationship between contextuality and nonlocality, facilitate the formulation of experimentally testable inequalities, and guide implementations in realistic physical platforms, with particular emphasis on photonic systems. By bridging abstract theoretical structures and concrete experimental realizations, this review sheds light on the nonclassical foundations of quantum correlations and their emerging role in quantum technologies.",

    "abstract": "We pursue our study of integrable weak noise theories of directed polymer and interacting particle stochastic models in the 1D KPZ universality class. Here we focus on the $q$-TASEP in either continuous or discrete time. Each particle on $\\mathbb{Z}$ jumps independently by $+1$ with a rate (or probability) depending on the gap to the next particle on its right. We consider initial conditions (either step or random) which are empty of particles on $\\mathbb{Z}^+$, and focus on the dynamics of the $N$ rightmost particles. In the limit $q \\to 1$ and at large time (and large gaps) we identify a new intermediate \"mesoscopic\" (i.e. finite $N$) regime which corresponds to weak noise. In that regime Poisson noise remains important. We obtain the large deviations of the position of a given particle by two methods. The first derives asymptotics of $q$-TASEP Fredholm determinant formula. The second maps the weak noise limit to a system of semi-discrete or fully discrete, non linear differential equations. These are obtained as saddle point classical equations of a dynamical field theory, and their solutions represent the optimal configurations in the large deviation regime. We show the classical integrability of these two systems, and exhibit their explicit Lax pair. In the case of the continuous time $q$-TASEP it provides the first instance of classical integrability arising in a stochastic system, with signatures of the Poisson noise persisting in the weak noise limit. For this model, we solve the scattering problem associated to its Lax pair and fully characterize the large deviations associated to the weak noise theory. Finally, we supplement this work with an Appendix on the first cumulant method to obtain the large deviations of several lattice polymer models (Strict Weak, Log Gamma, Beta).",

The volume fractions remain nontrivial and are transported by the limit flow. Our method is based on the introduction of suitable modulated quantities and a novel relative entropy functional adapted to the two-phase structure. The key novelty lies in an original comparison of L1 and L2 norms of the partial densities, exploiting the special structure of the bi-fluid system, together with a variant of Csiszar-Kullback- Pinsker inequality. It allows us to rigorously justify the convergence of weak solutions of the compressible system toward solutions of the corresponding incompressible limit system in the low Mach number regime.",

    "abstract": "We study free orthotropic material optimization for two-dimensional plane-stress compliance minimization with two well-ordered isotropic phases, motivated by the gap between tensors admissible in classical free-material optimization and tensors realizable by composites. To reduce this gap, we construct a hierarchy of realizability-aware admissible sets induced by zeroth-order, Voigt, and Hashin--Shtrikman (HS) energy bounds, moving from convex relaxations to a tighter nonconvex model. In the convex zeroth-order and Voigt settings, the Voigt set is strictly tighter for intermediate volume fractions and coincides with the zeroth-order set at pure-phase endpoints, and the Voigt model reduces to an isotropic variable-thickness-sheet formulation. In the single-loadcase continuum zeroth-order problem, at least one optimal solution can be chosen orthotropic. For HS constraints, we rewrite the bound as a Voigt term minus a nonnegative correction, clarifying strict tightening for interior volume fractions and local nonconvexity. We further prove that the convex hull of the HS feasible set equals the Voigt set and derive reduced formulations via active-constraint analysis and explicit elementwise volume characterization, including reductions specialized to orthotropic effective tensors. In the single-loadcase continuum setting, the HS relaxation is tight with the Allaire--Kohn relaxed problem, attained in the relaxation sense by sequential laminates, whereas in generic multi-loadcase settings it provides a lower bound on optimal compliance over general microstructures. The resulting nonconvex orthotropic HS problem is solved by sequential global programming, and numerical results confirm the predicted compliance hierarchy and show close agreement with finite-rank laminate references.",

In this work, we investigate ESQPTs within the three-level Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, where an enlarged Hilbert space and multiple separatrices give rise to rich spectral structures strongly influenced by chaos. To investigate the different dynamical regions, we have calculated Poincaré sections and Peres lattices. In addition, by combining chaos-sensitive measures with standard ESQPT diagnostics, we provide a static analysis of ESQPT signatures in this model and establish a robust framework for future studies of its dynamical behavior. The degree of chaos and the Kullback-Leibler divergence are found to be very effective chaos-sensitive measures, which are complementary to ESQPT diagnostics such as the mean field limit and the participation ratio. Hence we provide a standard framework to work with ESQPTs in chaotic three-level systems.",

    "title": "Operator learning for prescribed-time stabilization of reaction-diffusion systems",
    "abstract": "This paper addresses boundary prescribed-time stabilization of a one-dimensional heat equation with spatially and temporally varying coefficients. In contrast to asymptotic or exponential stabilization, prescribed-time stabilization ensures convergence to equilibrium within a user-defined time that is independent of the initial condition, a property that is particularly attractive in applications with stringent transient performance requirements. The backstepping design for this problem requires solving, at each time instant, a two-dimensional time-dependent kernel Partial Differential Equation (PDE) whose solution continuously varies with the plant coefficients. The repeated numerical solution of this parabolic kernel PDE results in a prohibitive computational burden, thereby limiting real-time applicability. To overcome this limitation, we propose a neural-operator-based approximation of the mapping from the time-varying system coefficient to the corresponding backstepping kernel. The operator is trained offline using representative solutions of the kernel PDE and subsequently deployed online to generate the required time-varying kernels in real time. We establish, via Lyapunov analysis, that the resulting neural-operator-based controller preserves prescribed-time stability provided that the operator approximation error satisfies an explicit bound. Furthermore, we investigate a direct approximation of the full feedback law mapping the plant parameter functions and state measurements to the boundary control input. For this setting, we prove semiglobal practical prescribed-time stability of the closed-loop system. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach reduces the computational cost of kernel generation by several orders of magnitude, thereby enabling real-time prescribed-time stabilization for heat equations with spatially and temporally varying coefficients.",

    "title": "Robustness of Persistent Topological Features and Minimum Homological Cuts",
    "abstract": "Persistent homology is a popular method for computing topological features of (metric) data. Standard approaches based on the Čech or Rips filtration are stable under small perturbations of the data, but highly sensitive to outliers. This lack of robustness has been frequently addressed in the literature. In this paper, we take a novel perspective by asking the following question: When can we guarantee that an observed persistent feature (a bar) is inherent to the underlying data in the presence of a limited number of unknown, arbitrary outliers. We formalize this question by introducing the notion of \\emph{adversarial robustness}, and study the problem of deciding whether a given bar in the barcode of a filtered simplicial complex is adversarially robust. We show that this problem is essentially equivalent to a homological variant of the minimum cut problem in simplicial complexes, which we believe to be of independent interest. As our main technical contribution, we provide the first computational complexity results for this problem, consisting of an efficient algorithm in $0$-dimensional homology, NP-hardness for the general problem, and an efficient algorithm for codimension-$1$ in $n$-dimensional complexes embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^n$. We also analyze its natural linear programming relaxation, whose dual defines a homological analog of the max-flow problem in graphs. We show that a max-flow/min-cut theorem does not hold in our setting, implying that the LP relaxation is not tight in general. Finally, in the special case of the Rips filtration, we provide a global heuristic based on the Hausdorff distance that guarantees adversarial robustness of sufficiently long bars. This connects adversarial robustness to standard stability theorems in persistent homology.",

    "abstract": "We study high-dimensional Laplace-type integrals of the form $I(λ):=\\int_{\\mathbb R^d} g(x)e^{-λf(x)}dx$ in the regime where $d$ and $λ$ are both large. Until now, rigorous bounds for Laplace expansions in growing dimension have been restricted to the \"Gaussian-approximation\" regime, known to hold when $d^2/λ\\to0$. This excludes many practically relevant regimes, including those arising in physics and modern high-dimensional statistics, which operate beyond this threshold while still satisfying the concentration condition $d/λ\\to0$. Here, we close this gap. We develop an explicit asymptotic expansion for $\\log I(λ)$ with quantitative remainder bounds that remain valid throughout this intermediate region, arbitrarily close to the concentration threshold $d/λ\\to0$.   Fix any $L\\ge1$ and suppose $g(0)=1$. Assume that, in a neighborhood of the minimizer of $f$, the operator norms of the derivatives of $f$ and $g$ are bounded independently of $d$ and $λ$ through orders $2(L+1)$ and $2L$, respectively. Assuming also some mild global growth conditions on $f$ and $g$, we prove that $$ \\log I(λ)=\\sum_{k=1}^{L-1} b_k(f,g)λ^{-k}+O(d^{L+1}/λ^L),\\quad d^{L+1}/λ^L\\to0, $$ and that the coefficients satisfy $b_k(f,g)= O(d^{k+1})$. Moreover, the coefficients $b_k(f,g)$ coincide with those arising from the formal cumulant-based expansion of $\\log I(λ)$.   The proof is constructive and proceeds via explicit polynomial changes of variables that iteratively \"quadratize\" the exponent while controlling Jacobian effects, thereby avoiding heavy Gaussian concentration machinery. We illustrate the expansion on two representative examples.",

We prove that both models exhibit tight interfaces and that, after centring by an appropriate deterministic speed, the interface position satisfies a central limit theorem.

We then analyze asymptotic properties of the resulting stochastic dynamics, extending convergence guarantees beyond previously studied settings that rely on smooth potentials, full-domain subdifferentials, or Lipschitz monotone operators.

This further allows us to develop a bridge between Latrémolière's framework and the W*-metric approach to quantum metric spaces. Furthermore, we construct Roe algebras for locally compact quantum metric spaces and verify that they recover the classical Roe algebras in the commutative case. We furthermore apply this framework to some examples of locally compact quantum metric spaces and show that it leads to the natural conclusion. Finally we use this framework to introduce notions of higher index theory for locally compact quantum metric spaces.",

    "abstract": "Physical experiments show that a capillary water jet is exponentially unstable under long-wave perturbations, while remaining stable under short-wave perturbations. Measurements further indicate that the exponential growth rate in the long-wave regime agrees quantitatively with the classical predictions of Rayleigh and Plateau. This phenomenon is known as the \\emph{Rayleigh-Plateau instability}. In this paper, we provide a mathematical justification of these experimental observations. The motion of the water jet is modeled by an irrotational Eulerian free-boundary system governed by surface tension. We prove that the (un)stable directions in the linearized system, corresponding to long-wave perturbations, are indeed tangent to an (un)stable invariant manifold of the full nonlinear system. On the other hand, the elliptic directions, corresponding to short-wave perturbations, are indeed tangent to a center invariant set in a generalized sense. These results give a positive answer to the question raised by Lin-Zeng concerning the existence of invariant manifolds for Eulerian free-boundary systems. The major methodological contribution is the construction of ``paradifferential propagator\" corresponding to linear paradifferential hyperbolic systems along elliptic directions, making Lyapunov-Perron type arguments applicable. The method effectively balances the loss of regularity in quasilinear problems and can be generalized to a broader class of PDEs.",

In this work, we go beyond the semi-Markov framework by considering some non-Markovian chains, which exhibit long-memory behaviour, due to stochastic dependence among their waiting times. Particular attention is devoted to the so-called para-Markov chains. Their waiting times share the same marginal distributions as those of the above mentioned semi-Markov chains, but they are dependent; their joint distribution is of Schur-constant type and is closely related to complete Bernstein functions and De Finetti's theorems. A second model that we focus on is given by time-changed Markov chains, where the random time is the inverse of an increasing stable process. This generalizes well-known semi-Markov models available in the literature, which typically focus solely on the inverse of the Levy stable subordinator. The above mentioned models are unified by a general theory of time change of Markov chains.",

    "abstract": "Sensitivity and specificity evaluated at an optimal diagnostic cut-off are fundamental measures of classification accuracy when continuous biomarkers are used for disease diagnosis. Joint inference for these quantities is challenging because their estimators are evaluated at a common, data-driven threshold estimated from both diseased and healthy samples, inducing statistical dependence. Existing approaches are largely based on parametric assumptions or fully nonparametric procedures, which may be sensitive to model misspecification or lack efficiency in moderate samples. We propose a semiparametric framework for joint inference on sensitivity and specificity at the Youden-optimal cut-off under the density ratio model. Using maximum empirical likelihood, we derive estimators of the optimal threshold and the corresponding sensitivity and specificity, and establish their joint asymptotic normality. This leads to Wald-type and range-preserving logit-transformed confidence regions. Simulation studies show that the proposed method achieves accurate coverage with improved efficiency relative to existing parametric and nonparametric alternatives across a variety of distributional settings. An analysis of COVID-19 antibody data demonstrates the practical advantages of the proposed approach for diagnostic decision-making.",

Similar results were derived in Hjort and Fenstad (1992, Annals of Statistics) for the case of Euclidean parameter spaces; part of the present contribution is to lift these results to situations involving parameter functionals. The apparatus we develop is also used to derive appropriate limit distributions of other quantities related to the far tail of an almost surely convergent sequence of estimators, like the number of times the estimator is more than $\\eps$ away from its target. We illustrate our results by giving a new sequential simultaneous confidence set for the cumulative hazard function based on the Nelson--Aalen estimator and investigate a problem in stochastic programming related to computational complexity.",

Since the mapping of causal models to the observational distribution that they induce is not one-to-one, in general, causal queries are often only partially identifiable. When binary statistical tests are used for testing partially-identifiable causal queries, their results do not translate in a straightforward manner to the causal hypothesis testing problem. We propose using ternary (three-outcome) statistical tests to test partially-identifiable causal queries. We establish testability requirements that ternary tests must satisfy in terms of uniform consistency and present equivalent topological conditions on the hypotheses. To leverage the existing toolbox of binary tests, we prove that obtaining ternary tests by combining binary tests is complete. Finally, we demonstrate how topological conditions serve as a guide to construct ternary tests for two concrete causal hypothesis testing problems, namely testing the instrumental variable (IV) inequalities and comparing treatment efficacy.",

    "abstract": "We study the free energy and dynamics of a closed elastic filament (a one-dimensional curve in two dimensions) whose local internal state is specified by curvature, stretch, and a scalar density field representing, for example, the concentration of an absorbed species. The density variable has a tendency to phase-separate whereas the local spontaneous curvature is concentration-dependent. There is also a coupling between concentration and the stretching of the filament, although our main interest is in the nearly inextensible regime. We formulate and simulate the dynamics, comprising a coupled Willmore flow and Cahn-Hilliard gradient flow on the full differential geometry of a closed filament, addressing issues that previous work typically sidestepped by restricting to the Monge gauge. We use a numerical strategy for global free energy minimization, presenting the equilibrium shapes and density profiles across a wide range of model parameters. The phase diagram is dominated by a relatively small number of simple shapes that exhibit, as expected, strong coupling between local curvature and concentration. We also find regimes where curvature and/or stretching energies suppress phase separation altogether. For selected parameter values we present fully dynamical results, tracking the time evolution of the various contributions to the free energy. The dynamics often arrive at metastable minima rather than the equilibrium state - for example, at states with more than the minimum number of interfaces between coexisting phases. The metastability of these states is absent for phase separation on a rigid circular domain and thus a direct result of the coupling between geometry and density.",

If a smooth graph is $ω$-calibrated on an open set, then it satisfies the rigidity system $\\nabla_V V=0$ and $\\nabla_X V=λX$ for all $X\\perp V$, hence is locally a radial distance-gradient field. In particular, for $m\\ge 2$ there is no smooth unit field on $S^n$ whose graph is $ω$-calibrated everywhere.   Finally, we construct an explicit smooth recovery sequence (presented in detail for $S^5$ and then extended to all odd dimensions) and prove a uniform nonvanishing estimate for the polar-shell normalization in the patching construction. As a consequence, $\\inf_{V}\\,\\mathrm{Vol}^S(V)=c(m;1)\\,\\mathrm{vol}(S^{n})$, so there is no Lavrentiev gap.",

We formulate the covariance steering problem as the minimization of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the steady state and target Gaussian distributions. To solve the problem, we develop a solution method, hereafter referred to as the proximal gradient-based algorithm, of promoting sparsity in the structural intervention by integrating the objective into a proximal gradient framework with L1 regularization. The main contribution of this paper lies in the analytical expression of the KL divergence gradient with respect to the intervention matrix: the gradient is characterized by the solutions to two Lyapunov equations related to the state covariance equation and its adjoint. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proximal gradient-based algorithm effectively identifies sparse, structurally-constrained interventions to achieve precise covariance steering.",

Under the assumption that $ g'(u)$ is uniformly bounded, we prove the blow-up theorem and a weighted blow-up result by means of characteristic lines, a priori estimates and the Riccati inequality. Moreover, we extend these blow-up results to the setting where $g'(u)$ is polynomially controlled, which includes typical nonlinearities such as $ g(u)=κu+3u^2 $ for the classical CH-KP equations. Furthermore, a Liouville-type uniqueness theorem is established under the condition $g(u) \\geq γu^2$ with $u \\neq 0$, $g(u)>γu^2$.",

We exhibit examples of (co)lax protomodular non-degenerate Ord-categories, which were unknown. We prove that, for varieties of ordered algebras which are Ord-Mal'tsev categories, the order of their algebras is degenerate (i.e. is symmetric). As a consequence, the implication \"protomodular => Mal'tsev\" cannot be carried out to our context. The case of non-coherent ordered varieties which are Ord-Mal'tsev categories is also addressed, where we show the existence of algebras with non-degenerate order.",

These curves arise as solutions of a variational problem on the unitary group describing optimally controlled quantum evolutions. By formulating the problem within a geometric gradient flow framework for Riemannian spline interpolation, we construct a well-posed fourth order evolution whose asymptotic limits realize the desired quantum splines. The analysis requires adapting the variational structure to boundary conditions dictated by the physical model, which are not directly amenable to the setting in our recently developed framework for gradient flows of Riemannian spline interpolation. We show that, despite these difficulties, the modified system admits a rigorous analytical treatment, yielding both existence and a constructive procedure for generating quantum splines. Our results provide a mathematical foundation for the variational description of smooth quantum control trajectories and clarify the analytical structure underlying their formation.",

    "abstract": "Coalescing particles on a line merge when they meet. When every site is initially occupied, only finitely many particles survive at any positive time, and their positions form a Pfaffian point process: all correlation functions are determined by pairwise quantities arranged in antisymmetric matrices. Previous proofs of this structure relied on analytic methods specific to time-homogeneous dynamics. We identify the checkerboard duality as the structural reason for the Pfaffian: on a discrete planar graph, binary random choices create two complementary non-crossing forests, one tracing ancestral lineages backward and the other carrying the coalescing particles forward as domain boundaries. This duality converts the absence of particles in an interval into coalescence of ancestral lineages at its endpoints. A cancellative labeling then converts coalescence into annihilation, for which a companion paper provides a Pfaffian formula. The resulting empty-interval formula holds for any discrete graph with the checkerboard structure and arbitrary inhomogeneous edge probabilities, requiring no symmetry or specific distributions. This covers settings beyond existing methods, including totally asymmetric dynamics and position-dependent transition rules, and yields an explicit Pfaffian point process in each setting. For Brownian motion, the formula recovers the known Pfaffian point process and the empty-interval probabilities previously derived by PDE methods.",

    "abstract": "We present a method to find asymptotics for the evolution of coherent states (or Gaussian wavepackets with standard deviation $\\sqrt{h}$) under semiclassical Schrödinger's equation for a given Hamiltonian. These results extend the work of Combescure and Robert, in which the evolution of coherent states can be approximated in the limit $h\\to 0$ with deformed Gaussian wavepackets called squeezed coherent states. The description with squeezed states holds for times $t$ that can go to infinity as $h\\to 0$, under the constraint $|t|\\leq |\\log h|/(6λ_0)$ where $λ_0$ is the maximal Lyapunov exponent of the classical dynamics. The breakdown of this approximation at time $|\\log h|/(6λ_0)$ is related to the bending of evolved wavepackets: once propagated states spread at a scale $h^{1/3}$, squeezed states no longer provide an appropriate description. To obtain a representation of propagated states valid up to times $|t|\\leq C|\\log h|$ with a larger $C$ (for instance, up to Ehrenfest's time $|\\log h|/(2λ_0)$ where spreading on macroscopic scales is allowed), we make additional assumptions on the flow $Φ_t$ associated to the classical dynamics, imposing constraints on directions of elongation. Namely, we work in a neighborhood of a normally hyperbolic $Φ_t$-invariant submanifold $K$, on which the dynamics is considered as slow in comparison with its transverse directions, along which $Φ_t$ is assumed to be hyperbolic. In this context, we describe the propagated state as a WKB state in transverse directions and a squeezed state along $K$. This description emphasizes the fact that propagated states should no longer be thought of as microlocalized on a point, but rather on an isotropic submanifold (corresponding to transverse unstable directions). Guillemin, Uribe, and Wang presented a similar class of wavefunctions microlocalized on an isotropic submanifold.",

We formulate our result using a notion of stratified equivalence inspired by the study of the smooth dual of $p$-adic groups via the structure of Hecke algebras, in particular by the work of Aubert, Baum, Plymen and Solleveld. We derive related new topological properties of the Mackey bijection.

    "title": "Resonant grazing bifurcations revisited",
    "abstract": "In vibro-impact mechanics, the division between an impact and a near miss is a zero-velocity grazing event. Grazing bifurcations of stable periodic motions often produce complicated attractors when grazing generates a square-root term in the Poincaré map. This paper concerns codimension-two scenarios for which the square-root term vanishes in some iterate of the Poincaré map. For forced one-degree-of-freedom oscillators, this occurs when the forcing frequency is a certain rational multiple of the damped natural frequency, i.e., the system is in resonance. In two-parameter bifurcation diagrams, curves of saddle-node and period-doubling bifurcations of single-impact periodic motions emanate from the codimension-two points. In this paper we prove these curves are quadratically tangent to the curve of grazing bifurcations, and derive explicit formulas for their quadratic coefficients. This is achieved by modifying the Poincaré map in a way that circumvents the square-root singularity, enabling us to use the implicit function theorem to demonstrate smoothness and perform asymptotic calculations of the saddle-node and period-doubling bifurcation curves. In doing so we resolve a long-standing conjecture on the admissibility of single-impact periodic motions by supplementing raw asymptotic computations with geometric and topological arguments. We illustrate the results with a linear impact oscillator model, matching the theoretical unfolding to numerically computed bifurcation curves. The results explain why previously reported physical experiments reveal an absence of chaos shortly past the grazing bifurcation.",

    "abstract": "The computational cost of persistent homology is often dominated by the growth of the underlying simplicial filtrations. Many different filtrations exist, each with its own assumptions and trade-offs, but all face some form of this growth which can be exponential in the worst case, as for the Vietoris-Rips. We recast this problem at the level of covers, developing a framework in which filtrations and persistence modules can be constructed, analyzed, and compared through simple relations between covers rather than at the level of simplicial complexes. The guarantees propagate through any functor that preserves the contiguity of refinement maps, we give the example of two such functors: the Nerve and the Co-Nerve. Working at this level is drastically simpler, with stronger, more general consequences. We explore this perspective and show how it can be used to construct a robust approximation of the Vietoris-Rips filtration that is orders of magnitude smaller, while maintaining a log 3-interleaving unconditionally for any metric space. The resulting filtration restores near-linear scaling in the number of data points and enable us to efficiently capture homology at high degrees.",

We go through these instances and leave further parameters to later research, by either the author or some readers. Dealing with cubic equations in a meaningful way requires some skills with Maple.

The proof relies on the existence of a specific pendant tree, combined with a method by Schwenk that swaps trees to construct a cospectral mate.   It seems possible that pendant trees are essentially the only obstruction, meaning that the giant should become characterized by spectrum with high probability if one prunes these by considering the 2-core. The majority of the paper is devoted to theoretical and numerical evidence supporting this concept. Our main theorem in this direction establishes that local switching methods can not cause the 2-core to be cospectral. We also discuss R-cospectrality and rational cospectrality at fixed level.",

Moreover, we prove that these pointwise decay estimates are sharp for a generic class of small initial data decaying sufficiently fast.   As applications of these estimates, we demonstrate that the energy of one component of the solution admits a lower bound that generically grows to infinity as $t\\to +\\infty$, which can be interpreted as ``blowing up at infinity.\" Furthermore, we verify that this component generically exhibits an energy cascade from high to low frequencies.",

    "abstract": "This paper addresses a distributed nonconvex optimization problem over multi-agent networks, where each agent exchanges its local information solely with its neighbors. Given that most existing distributed nonconvex optimization algorithms are susceptible to information leakage during inter agent communications, we propose a Robust Proximal Primal dual algorithm, referred to as RPP, to enhance the security of information transmission. In contrast to many existing approaches that directly transmit local variables throughout the network, we introduce carefully designed random noises to obfuscate sensitive local information. This not only preserves privacy but also demonstrates the noise robustness of our proposed algorithm. We establish a sublinear rate at which RPP converges to a stationary solution. Moreover, by incorporating Chebyshev acceleration, an accelerated variant of RPP is developed and achieves the optimal communication complexity bound for the algorithms that allow for exchanging local deci sions at each iteration. The superior convergence performance of RPP is validated through a few numerical experiments, which also indicate that, within an appropriate range, the introduced perturbations do not impede the convergence speed of RPP.",

Starting from inverse semigroup data equipped with admissible twist information, we construct a canonical twisted universal groupoid in the sense of Paterson and introduce a mirror correspondence encoding intrinsic asymmetry. Our main result identifies a structural obstruction to mirror self-duality at the level of twisted universal groupoids and shows that this obstruction descends to an obstruction for the associated reduced twisted groupoid $C^*$-algebra to be isomorphic to its opposite.

    "abstract": "Emerging applications increasingly demand flexible covariate adaptive randomization (CAR) methods that support unequal targeted allocation ratios. While existing procedures can achieve covariate balance, they often suffer from the shift problem. This occurs when the allocation ratios of some additional covariates deviate from the target. We show that this problem is equivalent to a mismatch between the conditional average allocation ratio and the target among units sharing specific covariate values, revealing a failure of existing procedures in the long run. To address it, we derive a new form of allocation function by requiring that balancing covariates ensures the ratio matches the target. Based on this form, we design a class of parameterized allocation functions. When the parameter roughly matches certain characteristics of the covariate distribution, the resulting procedure can balance covariates. Thus, we propose a feasible randomization procedure that updates the parameter based on collected covariate information, rendering the procedure non-Markovian. To accommodate this, we introduce a CAR framework that allows non-Markovian procedure. We then establish its key theoretical properties, including the boundedness of covariate imbalance in probability and the asymptotic distribution of the imbalance for additional covariates. Ultimately, we conclude that the feasible randomization procedure can achieve covariate balance and eliminate the shift.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we mainly revisit a nice theory for topological entropy of weakly equivalent flows, which was originally investigated by Ohno in 1980. We will develop a new approach, being more straightforward and elementary than the measure-theoretic one provided by Ohno, to the theory for weak equivalence of flows, and as a novelty, we study both topological entropy and mean dimension with a highly unified process in relation to such objects.   In particular, for weakly equivalent flows without fixed points we recover Ohno's theorem for topological entropy relation with a substantially different method, and moreover, carry out an analogue within the framework of mean dimension; while for weakly equivalent flows with fixed points, our technique refines the procedure suggested in Ohno's construction, and strengthens Ohno's example with a view towards topological complexity of dynamical systems.   Essentially, our method is topological. For this purpose, we first introduce a modification to the definition of topological entropy, by relating a spanning set inside the state space to a finite set outside, which comes to be a tiny but key difference, via a map, and further, show that it leads eventually to the same value as the topological entropy. Although to an intermediate extent, the modified quantity generally does not coincide with the one appearing in the classical definition, it has some basic combinatorial feature, which not only applies flexibly to topological entropy, but also adapts directly to the mean dimension context. Using this alternative, we are allowed to re-establish and enrich Ohno's theory.",

We first propose an exact sequential lifting algorithm for the binary knapsack set, which employs the dominance list structure to remove redundant storage and computation in the dynamic programming (DP) array. This structure preserves scale invariance and effectively handles constraints with non-integer coefficients. Then, a reduction method is developed for the lifting procedure under some conditions, further enhancing computational efficiency. Finally, numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms DP with arrays in terms of both efficiency and stability, particularly for large-scale and large-capacity instances. Moreover, it enables exact sequential lifting for binary knapsack sets with non-integer weights and large capacities, making it directly applicable in modern MIP solvers.",

    "abstract": "A single informed agent can draw an arbitrarily large network to the ground truth. This is the sharpest consequence of the \"Averaging plus Learning\" framework studied here, where agents update opinions by socially averaging neighbours while some receive private feedback at heterogeneous rates. The key is a graph-theoretic property we call condensely anchored, which implies convergence to the correct consensus on fixed networks. In the original framework of Popescu and Vaidya (2023), every agent was required to learn. Removing that requirement changes the problem fundamentally: the underlying graph must now carry the signal from a handful of anchors to everyone else. When learning rates decay to zero, a persistence condition on the rates alone suffices, with no uniform connectivity or aperiodicity assumed. The hardest case is intermittent connectivity, where no single time step contracts in any standard norm. A mixed-operator-norm framework is developed that extracts two-step contraction from the interplay between aggregate learning mass and entrywise diffusion of influence, a mechanism new to consensus literature. Finally, we demonstrate the framework's robustness: vanishing noise preserves convergence to the ground truth, whereas persistent noise drives the system to a limiting law.",

We prove the existence of a pathwise mean-field equilibrium in this context by developing new technical tools for compactification to accommodate rough integration, which deviate substantially from classical compactification arguments in the literature. Finally, we discuss the relationship between the pathwise problem and the classical MFG problem with randomized Brownian common noise: conditioning yields the pathwise problem almost surely; and conversely, under a suitable causality/measurable-selection requirement, pathwise mean-field equilibria can be aggregated to produce randomized mean-field equilibria in the classical problem.",

    "abstract": "Dantzig-Wolfe reformulation is a widely used technique for obtaining stronger relaxations in the context of branch-and-bound methods for solving integer optimization problems. Arc-Flow reformulations are a lesser known technique related to dynamic programming that has experienced a resurgence as result of the recent popularization of decision diagrams as a tool for solving integer programs. Although these two reformulation techniques arose independently, the recently proposed solution paradigm known as column elimination has revealed that they are in fact closely connected. Building on a unified formulation and notation, this study clarifies the theoretical connections and computational trade-offs between these two reformulations.   We first revisit the known fact that the LP relaxations of these two reformulations yield the same dual bound. We then dig deeper, establishing conditions under which valid inequalities in the original, Dantzig-Wolfe, or Arc-Flow spaces can be translated across reformulations without loss of strength, and reinterpreting iterative strengthening methods, such as decremental state-space relaxation and column elimination, through the lens of cutting planes. To assess the potential impact of these insights empirically, we benchmark both reformulations under identical conditions on the vehicle routing problem with time windows using state-of-the-art column- and cut-generation techniques. The results identify clear contrasts: the Arc-Flow reformulation benefits from faster convergence and performs best when subproblems are highly relaxed or low-dimensional, whereas the Dantzig-Wolfe reformulation is more efficient when the master problem remains compact. Overall, our study provides a unified perspective and practical guidelines for choosing between Dantzig-Wolfe and Arc-Flow reformulations in large-scale integer optimization.",

While gradient dominance has been extensively studied, continuous-time and discrete-time LQRs have largely been analyzed separately, relying on slightly different assumptions, proof strategies, and resulting guarantees. In this paper, we present a unified gradient dominance property for both continuous-time and discrete-time LQRs under mild stabilizability and detectability assumptions. Our analysis is based on a convex reformulation derived from a common Lyapunov inequality representation and a unified change-of-variables procedure. This convex-lifting perspective yields a single proof framework applicable to both time models. The unified treatment clarifies how differences between continuous-time and discrete-time dynamics influence theoretical guarantees and reveals a deeper structural symmetry between the two formulations.

This construction provides an intrinsic eleven-dimensional carrier for modular data and admits a canonical tilting and comparison procedure that yields elliptic geometry as an output rather than an auxiliary input. Using this framework, we establish a precise M-theory/Type IIB dictionary in the constant-coupling sector, showing how the physical axio-dilaton is fixed by eleven-dimensional geometric and topological data. The correspondence is tested at the level of the ten-dimensional bosonic effective action, including its topological couplings inherited from eleven dimensions. The tower-completed geometry naturally organizes global sectors in generalized cohomology, with charge data governed by K-theory and exhibiting a canonical prime-power torsion structure. We further show how this framework extends to varying-coupling backgrounds and duality defects, admits a natural adelic completion with prime-independence, and generalizes to higher-rank and U-duality geometries. We also discuss holographic aspects and the anomaly-refined extension of the duality group beyond the bosonic truncation. Together, these results provide a coherent, non-singular foundation for F-theory and its extensions.",

These solutions can be parametrized by the period $L$, the mass $M$, and the absolute value of the angular momentum $|J| >0$. We provide strong numerical evidence for the existence of such configurations, without any restriction in terms of the distance between horizons. This is in sharp contrast with the non-zero total angular momentum case, as it was recently established in \\cite{Peraza:2024uto} that static single-horizon periodic solutions cannot be put into rotation if $L < 4M$. It is shown that these solutions do not have any struts on the axis, and it is also explicitly shown that, by taking non-equidistant horizons, struts develop between the black holes.

    "abstract": "The introduction of stochasticity into continuous ecological models frequently relies on phenomenological, diagonal diffusion terms that lack a rigorous microscopic basis. We demonstrate that this standard practice fundamentally misrepresents the geometry of demographic fluctuations. By deriving a stochastic Rosenzweig--MacArthur model directly from an integer-valued, Bernoulli-coupled continuous-time Markov chain, we isolate the exact diffusion covariance structure dictated by event stoichiometry. We mathematically prove that coupled predation--conversion events inherently generate a structurally negative predator--prey cross-covariance, exposing the severe mathematical and biological limitations of standard diagonal-noise approximations. Furthermore, we resolve a persistent ambiguity in stochastic population modeling by explicitly formalizing the bifurcation between open-domain formulations (for survival-conditioned interior dynamics) and absorbed formulations (for extinction-permitting dynamics). To rigorously support this distinction, we develop a tailored two-stage Lyapunov well-posedness architecture that separates non-explosion criteria from boundary-barrier positivity invariance. By bridging microscopic event stoichiometry with macroscopic boundary-degenerate diffusions, this work replaces ad hoc noise constructs with a definitive, mathematically exact template for covariance-consistent and boundary-aware ecological modeling.",

The Lagrangian trajectory in the infinite-dimensional group of diffeomorphisms on the physical space can be written as a system of conservation laws. The relation between solutions of the Cauchy problem for the conservation law and solutions of the corresponding Cauchy problem on the diffeomorphism group extends to weak solutions of the coresponding problems. The correspondence between particle paths and transport equations is analogous to that between a Lie group and the corresponding Lie algebra.   This paper establishes that for scalar conservation laws the particle paths are extremals of an action functional on the space of diffeomorphisms; that is, they are geodesics in some metric. In some examples of systems of conservation laws, including the physical example of isentropic gas dynamics in one space dimension, diffeomorphism representations also exist and may be interpreted as extremals of action functionals.",

    "abstract": "Model Predictive Control (MPC) offers a versatile framework for constraint handling and multi-objective optimisation, yet practical application faces challenges regarding initial and recursive feasibility, robustness against model mismatches, and sampled-data constraints. This thesis develops a novel MPC framework for a class of non-linear continuous-time systems governed by functional differential equations. It targets output tracking within prescribed error bounds while systematically overcoming these challenges.   First, we introduce funnel MPC, an algorithm eliminating reliance on terminal conditions or restrictive long prediction horizons. Utilising funnel penalty functions -- state costs penalising tracking error deviations from time-varying boundaries -- this framework ensures feasibility while rigorously enforcing tracking performance guarantees.   Next, we unify funnel MPC with model-free funnel feedback into a hybrid architecture. This synergises model-based optimisation with adaptive feedback compensation, achieving prescribed tracking performance despite structural model-plant mismatches, unmodelled dynamics, and unknown disturbances.   To further enhance predictive accuracy, we integrate a data-driven learning framework that iteratively refines the model using system measurements, improving long-term performance without compromising robustness.   Finally, we formalise the transition to sampled-data implementations. We derive explicit bounds on sampling rates and control effort to guarantee stability under piecewise constant control signals, a critical step for digital hardware deployment.   By addressing feasibility, robustness, learning, and sampling, this thesis establishes a cohesive framework for output tracking within prescribed bounds, paving the way for future advances in learning-enhanced and robust MPC.",

The choice-based linear programming (CBLP) formulation provides a powerful framework for optimizing sales allocations across customer segments, yet traditional approaches often fail to solve CBLPs of huge scale (involving millions of customer choices) due to the lack of algorithmic designs that exploit problem structure. To overcome this computational bottleneck, we propose a first-order primal-dual method, SPFOM, which requires only a small computational cost per iteration, achieves a provably near-optimal convergence rate, and can be readily extended to parallel computing environments. Computational experiments demonstrate the computational and practical superiority of SPFOM over state-of-the-art solvers for large-scale linear programs. The framework is extended to a multi-period assortment optimization setting with inventory constraints, where SPFOM estimates global shadow prices that enhance classical bid-price control policies compared with benchmark methods such as market segment decomposition. Numerical experiments and a case study using real-world data from the ZOZOTOWN platform validate the practical effectiveness of SPFOM, highlighting its advantages in improving revenue performance while maintaining balanced inventory levels.",

We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in a Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics of a water molecule, showing that the resulting simulations accurately reproduce key structural properties, such as bond lengths and bond angle, obtained from full first-principles molecular dynamics. This work highlights the potential of data-driven approaches to develop efficient electronic structure solvers for first-principles simulations.",

These coordinates are referred to as the non-regular part of the model. We show that in a ``pre-asymptotic'' regime in which the limiting Laplace approximation is not yet valid, the low-temperature Gibbs distribution concentrates on a neighborhood of its mode. Within this region, the distribution is a bounded perturbation of a product measure: a strongly log-concave distribution in the regular part and a one-dimensional exponential-type distribution in each coordinate of the non-regular part. Leveraging this structure, we provide a non-asymptotic sampling guarantee by analyzing the spectral gap of Langevin dynamics. Key examples of low-temperature Gibbs distributions include Bayesian posteriors, and we demonstrate our results on three canonical examples: a high-dimensional logistic regression model, a Poisson linear model, and a Gaussian mixture model.",

The Ramanujan condition corresponds to the optimal rate of decay of correlations for the associated non-backtracking edge subshift. We consider a higher-dimensional generalization of this observation. We introduce the notion of a $d$-regular $\\mathbb{Z}^δ$-subshift of finite type, and we define a Ramanujan subshift as a $d$-regular $\\mathbb{Z}^δ$-subshift with an optimal rate of decay of correlations. We show that for every odd prime power $q\\geq 3$ and dimension $δ<q$, there exists a $q$-regular Ramanujan $\\mathbb{Z}^δ$-subshift. The construction is based on the quaternionic lattices over $\\mathbb{F}_q(t)$ introduced by Rungtanapirom-Stix-Vdovina (2019). Each of our $q$-regular Ramanujan subshifts gives rise to a family of non-bipartite $(q+1)$-regular Ramanujan graphs. These graphs are very explicit and local in the strong sense: the neighbors of any vertex can be computed by an explicit Mealy automaton associated with the subshift. As a byproduct, for every odd prime power $q$, we get a single lifting rule that can be iterated to produce an infinite family of $(q+1)$-regular Ramanujan graphs.",

In particular, we construct a fully non-perturbative partition function for the Virasoro minimal string in terms of a Zak transform. In this context, negative tension D-branes appear naturally, which in the matrix model correspond to anti-eigenvalues, or instantons on the involuted sheet of the spectral curve. We further extend this analysis to resolvents and observe resurgent wall crossing phenomena between ZZ- and FZZT-branes. Using recent results that relate the Virasoro minimal string to 3d gravity with end-of-the-world branes we proceed to study the resurgent consequences of summing over the genus in 3d gravity, where we find non-perturbative contributions of doubly exponential type. These statements are then tested using resurgent large-order asymptotics. Lastly, we compute the non-perturbative eigenvalue density for generic hermitian matrix models and identify the change of asymptotic behavior at the edge of the eigenvalue distribution with a Stokes transition. This allows us to identify oscillations in the eigenvalue density with anti-Stokes behavior of FZZT-branes. In the case of 3d gravity with end-of-the-world branes we comment how this Stokes transition coincides with the onset of black hole behaviour and compute the non-perturbative primary density. Furthermore, we apply these techniques to the eigenvalue density of JT gravity to compute higher genus corrections.",

This interpretation gives rise to an action of $Λ^{[2]}$ on the ordinary ring of symmetric functions $Λ$, which is described concretely in terms of Adams operations and skewing by power sums.

These systems describe quantum fluids when the graph is complete, and the pair function has a well-defined permutation symmetry.

    "abstract": "Exceptional points, where two or more eigenstates of a non-Hermitian system coalesce, are now of interest across many fields of physics, from the perspective of open-system dynamics, sensing, nonreciprocal transport, and topological phase transitions. In this work, we investigate exceptional points in cavity optomechanics, a platform of interest to diverse communities working on gravitational-wave detection, macroscopic quantum mechanics, quantum transduction, etc. Specifically, we clarify the role of quantum jumps in making a clear distinction between Liouvillian and Hamiltonian exceptional points in optomechanical systems. While the Liouvillian exceptional point arises from the unconditional Lindblad dynamics and is independent of the phonon-bath temperature, the Hamiltonian exceptional point emerges from the conditional no-jump evolution and acquires a thermal shift due to an enhanced conditional damping. Employing the thermofield formalism, we derive a unified spectral framework that interpolates between these regimes via an analytical hybrid-Liouvillian description. Remarkably, in the weak-quantum-jump regime, the exceptional point is perturbed only at the second order, highlighting the robustness of the Hamiltonian exceptional point under small hybrid perturbations. Our work reveals a continuous family of hybrid exceptional points, clarifies the operational and physical differences between the conditional and unconditional dissipative dynamics in optomechanical systems, and provides a probe for thermal baths.",

We prove a sharp controlled-jump rule showing that the controlled gate $CU$ lies strictly in level $m+2$ of the hierarchy, and equivalently that $CU$ lies in level $k$ if $U^{2^{k-2}}$ is Pauli while no smaller positive power of $U$ is Pauli. We further quantify the resources required to realize large level jumps in the Clifford hierarchy by proving an essentially tight upper bound on Pauli periodicity as a function of the number of qubits, which implies that accessing high hierarchy levels through controlled Cliffords requires a number of target qubits that grows exponentially with the desired level. We complement this limitation with explicit infinite families of Pauli-periodic Cliffords whose controlled versions achieve asymptotically optimal jumps.

    "abstract": "We study two-dimensional Coulomb gases in the presence of $m\\in\\mathbb{N}_{>0}$ outposts. An outpost is a connected component of the coincidence set that lies outside the droplet.   The case $m=1$ was previously investigated by Ameur, Charlier, and Cronvall. They showed that, as the total number of particles in the Coulomb gas tends to infinity, the number of particles accumulating near the outpost remains of order one and converges in distribution to the Heine distribution.   In this work, we extend this analysis to the case of an arbitrary but fixed number $m$ of outposts. We prove that the joint distribution of the numbers of particles near the outposts converges to a multidimensional Heine distribution. Our results reveal a interesting phenomenon: although the outposts are geometrically disconnected, the particle count near each outpost is strongly correlated with the particle counts near all other outposts, not only the nearest ones (provided the outposts are not separated by a component of the droplet).",

    "abstract": "In 1977, Makanin established the decidability of equations in free monoids. A key ingredient in his proof is the exponent of periodicity: for a word $w$, it is the largest exponent $e$ such that $w$ contains a nonempty factor of the form $p^e$. Makanin showed that if a system of equations in a free monoid has a solution with sufficiently large exponent of periodicity, then it has infinitely many solutions. However, the converse -- whether the existence of infinitely many solutions implies the existence of solutions with arbitrarily large exponent of periodicity -- remains open.   In this paper, we investigate the analogous problem for quadratic equations in finitely generated groups. Using normal forms to define the exponent of periodicity, we identify structural conditions on groups and their normal forms that guarantee that infinite solution sets of quadratic systems have an unbounded exponent of periodicity. We prove that these conditions are preserved under graph products and, in particular, hold for all finitely generated right-angled Artin groups. In addition, we show that they also hold for finitely generated (graph products of) torsion-free nilpotent and hyperbolic groups, and we characterize the Baumslag-Solitar groups satisfying them.",

Broadly speaking, we discover that the stability index as well as the random radii manifest themselves only in constants in the otherwise exponential decay rates.

In the presence of a strong, constant background field $\\mathbf{F}$, the evolution of the magnetic perturbation $\\boldsymbol{b}$ is governed by the linearized induction equation. We analyze the system on both the entire space $Ω= \\mathbb{R}^d$ and a periodic domain $Ω= \\prod_{i=1}^d [0, L_i)$, which models a homogeneous medium with side lengths $L_i > 0$. We analyze this problem by decomposing it into the injectivity of a parabolic forward map and the solvability of a divergence-free transport sub-problem. On the whole space $\\mathbb{R}^d$, we show that the transport sub-problem is well-posed when data is prescribed on a non-characteristic hypersurface transverse to $\\mathbf{F}$. On the torus, we establish a sharp uniqueness criterion based on the rational dependence of the ratios $\\{F_i/L_i\\}_{i=1}^d$ between the background-field components and the corresponding domain periods. Furthermore, we show that for the reconstructed velocity to belong to $L^2$, a sufficient condition is that the background field must satisfy a Diophantine condition.

    "abstract": "Eigenvalue and eigenvector perturbation theory is a fundamental topic in several disciplines, including numerical linear algebra, quantum physics, and related fields. The central problem is to understand how the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix $A \\in \\mathbb{C}^{n \\times n}$ change under the addition of a perturbation matrix $E \\in \\mathbb{C}^{n \\times n}$. Much of the existing literature focuses on structured perturbations. For example, in [C.-K. Li and R.-C. Li, Linear Algebra Appl. 2005], the matrix $A$ is assumed to be Hermitian and block diagonal, while the perturbation $E$ is Hermitian and block off-diagonal. In this work, we investigate a different structured setting in which the perturbation has the commutator form $E = AB - BA$ for some matrix $B$, which we show to be a generalization of the block diagonal structure considered by Li and Li. First, we extend their main result by showing that the perturbation of the $i$-th eigenvalue of $A$, denoted by $λ_i$, is of order $\\|E\\|^2 / η_i$, where $η_i = \\min_{j \\neq i} |λ_i - λ_j|$ is the spectral gap associated with $λ_i$. Second, we provide a detailed analysis of the role played by the matrix $B$ in the perturbation of the eigenvectors. This analysis is further generalized to the case of block-diagonal matrices with multiple eigenvalues, as well as to perturbed singular values and eigenvalues of Jordan blocks.",

    "title": "Robust Model Selection for Discovery of Latent Mechanistic Processes",
    "abstract": "When learning interpretable latent structures using model-based approaches, even small deviations from modeling assumptions can lead to inferential results that are not mechanistically meaningful. In this work, we consider latent structures that consist of $K_o$ mechanistic processes, where $K_o$ is unknown. When the model is misspecified, likelihood-based model selection methods can substantially overestimate $K_o$ while more robust nonparametric methods can be overly conservative. Hence, there is a need for approaches that combine the sensitivity of likelihood-based methods with the robustness of nonparametric ones. We formalize this objective in terms of a robust model selection consistency property, which is based on a component-level discrepancy measure that captures the mechanistic structure of the model. We then propose the accumulated cutoff discrepancy criterion (ACDC), which leverages plug-in estimates of component-level discrepancies. To apply ACDC, we develop mechanistically meaningful component-level discrepancies for a general class of latent variable models that includes unsupervised and supervised variants of probabilistic matrix factorization and mixture modeling. We show that ACDC is robustly consistent when applied to unsupervised matrix factorization and mixture models. Numerical results demonstrate that in practice our approach reliably identifies a mechanistically meaningful number of latent processes in numerous illustrative applications, outperforming existing methods.",

    "title": "A Polyhedral Study on Unit Commitment with a Single Type of Binary Variables",
    "abstract": "Efficient power production scheduling is a crucial concern for power system operators aiming to minimize operational costs. Previous mixed-integer linear programming formulations for unit commitment (UC) problems have primarily used two or three types of binary variables. The investigation of strong formulations with a single type of binary variables has been limited, as it is believed to be challenging to derive strong valid inequalities using fewer binary variables, and the reduction of the number of binary variables is often accompanied by a compromise in tightness. To address these issues, this paper considers a formulation for unit commitment using a single type of binary variables and develops strong valid inequality families to enhance the tightness of the formulation. Conditions under which these strong valid inequalities serve as facet-defining inequalities for the single-generator UC polytope are provided. For those large-size valid inequality families, the existence of efficient separation algorithms for determining the most violated inequalities is also discussed. The effectiveness of the proposed single-binary formulation and strong valid inequalities is demonstrated through computational experiments on network-constrained UC problems. The results indicate that the strong valid inequalities presented in this paper are effective in solving UC problems and can also be applied to UC formulations that contain more than one type of binary variables.",

The limiting model, which has the structure of an obstacle free boundary problem in time, provides an effective approach to the description of the range expansion of a population as a result of growth, saturation and dispersion. We then establish the main mathematical properties of this singular problem. In particular, we characterize the evolution of a free boundary that delimits the saturated area.

    "abstract": "The $SL(2,\\mathbb{Z})$-orbits of primitive $n$-squared origamis can be represented by finite four-regular graphs. It is a conjecture of McMullen that the orbit graphs of such origamis in the stratum $\\mathcal{H}(2)$ form an expander family. We provide indirect evidence for this conjecture by proving that the absolute values of the Euler characteristics of the graphs in this family go to infinity with the number of squares $n$. This generalises previous work of the authors, in which we established eventual non-planarity for this family, and provides the strongest indirect evidence to date for McMullen's conjecture. We also prove that the same phenomenon holds for primitive origamis in the Prym loci of $\\mathcal{H}(4)$ and $\\mathcal{H}(6)$. Assuming conjectures of Zmiaikou and Delecroix--Lelièvre, we establish the same in $\\mathcal{H}(1,1)$ and for two families of non-Prym origamis in $\\mathcal{H}(4)$. Finally, assuming a stronger conjecture concerning orbit growth in low-complexity strata, we establish that for any family of $SL(2,\\mathbb{Z})$-orbit graphs of primitive origamis in a stratum with one or two conical singularities, the absolute values of the Euler characteristics of the graphs go to infinity with the number of squares along a density one subsequence. By relating the genus of the elliptic generator orbit graphs to the genus of the associated arithmetic Teichmüller curves, we also recover results of Mukamel and extend results of Torres-Teigel--Zachhuber establishing that the genus of these Teichmüller curves in $\\mathcal{H}(2)$ and the Prym loci of $\\mathcal{H}(4)$ and $\\mathcal{H}(6)$ also go to infinity.

    "abstract": "For several physically relevant SPDEs, it is known that global weak solutions coexist with local strong ones. Typically, weak-strong uniqueness results are known, and ensure that the global and strong solutions coincide as long as the latter exist. Times at which a weak solution does not coincide with a strong one are called singular times. Determining their fractal dimension is fundamental to capturing the regularity of weak solutions.   We define singular times for a wide class of semilinear SPDEs. We show that sets of singular times have fractal dimension (i.e., Hausdorff and/or Minkowski) at most $ 1-\\ell\\, \\mathsf{Exc}$, where $\\ell$ and $\\mathsf{Exc}$ are the time integrability and the excess of spatial regularity compared to the critical regularity of the energy bound associated with weak solutions, respectively. Moreover, their corresponding $(1-\\ell\\,\\mathsf{Exc} )$-dimensional measure is zero. We formulate and apply our theory to quenched strong Leray-Hopf solutions of 3D Navier-Stokes equations (NSEs) with physically relevant noises, including rough Kraichnan and Lie transport. In particular, we extend the fundamental $1/2$-dimensional bound of Leray and Scheffer on singular times for 3D NSEs to the stochastic setting, and we prove new conditional results under supercritical Serrin's conditions, irrespective of the roughness of the noise. Our framework is new even in the deterministic case, and provides the first partial regularity results for weak solutions to SPDEs with multiplicative noise.",

Building on the particle-kinetic-hydrodynamic hierarchy developed for non-rotating floes, we generalize the particle model to describe ice floes as rigid bodies characterized by position, linear velocity, angular velocity, size, and moment of inertia. The interaction rules now include nonlinear contact forces and torques arising from short-range compression, restitution, and tangential friction laws, together with hydrodynamic drag that couples translational and rotational motions. These particle descriptions lead to an enriched Vlasov-type kinetic equation posed on an extended phase space, whose moments yield a hydrodynamic system for mass, momentum, and angular-momentum balances. Compared with Part I, the resulting macroscopic equations feature additional stress contributions, rotational transport, and dissipative mechanisms stemming from nonlinear collisions. The proposed framework provides a more realistic description of sea-ice floe dynamics and offers a systematic pathway toward multiscale modeling of sea-ice rheology under complex environmental forcing.",

Given a discrete ordinates discretization, we report the corresponding matrix structures, depending on model and discretization parameters. Despite the possibly dense nature of these matrices, the use of Krylov methods is effective (especially in the matrix-free context) and robust. We propose a theoretical analysis, using the spectral tools of the symbol theory, explaining why Krylov convergence is robust w.r.t. all the discretization parameters, even in the unpreconditioned case. In fact, the compactness of the continuous operators used in the modeling leads to zero-clustered dense matrix sequences plus identity, so that the clustering at the unity of the spectra is deduced. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical results, which have a direct application, for example, in the simulation of radiative transfer in stellar atmospheres, a key problem in astrophysical research. In general, we demonstrate that optimal scaling with respect to RT discretization parameters is expected for Krylov solution strategies.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents an aggressiveness-aware control framework for quadrotor UAVs that integrates learning-based oracles to mitigate the effects of unknown disturbances. Starting from a nominal tracking controller on $\\mathrm{SE}(3)$, unmodeled generalized forces and moments are estimated using a learning-based oracle and compensated in the control inputs. An aggressiveness-aware gain scheduling mechanism adapts the feedback gains based on probabilistic model-error bounds, enabling reduced feedback-induced aggressiveness while guaranteeing a prescribed practical exponential tracking performance. The proposed approach makes explicit the trade-off between model accuracy, robustness, and control aggressiveness, and provides a principled way to exploit learning for safer and less aggressive quadrotor maneuvers.",

    "abstract": "We develop a formal framework for the behavioral comparison of linear systems across different time domains. We accomplish this by introducing the notion of system interpolation, which determines whether the input-state trajectories of a continuous-time system can be realized as piecewise polynomial interpolations of the input-state trajectories of a discrete-time system. In this context, a piecewise polynomial interpolation of a discrete-time signal is characterized as a continuous-time function that coincides with the discrete-time signal at given sampling instants and can be realized as a polynomial of a prescribed degree over intervals between these instants. By representing piecewise polynomial functions as linear combinations of shifted Legendre polynomials, we characterize system interpolation as a subspace inclusion that is completely in terms of system parameters. This therefore allows for a computationally efficient comparison of the input-state behavior of a continuous-time system with that of a discrete-time one. We then exploit this characterization to discretize a given continuous-time system into a discrete-time one. Lastly, given a control specification, we exploit system interpolation to synthesize controllers that ensure satisfaction at each given sampling instant, while they measure the extent of (possible) violation over intervals between these instants.",

For the regularized model, we establish long time ($T \\sim \\mathcal O(\\varepsilon^{-2/3})$) well-posedness and uniform energy estimates with respect to the relaxation parameter $\\varepsilon>0$.

However, its linear convergence rate suffers from ill-conditioned problems and is highly sensitive to the smallest nonzero singular value. In this work, we aim to extend the classical Kaczmarz to nearly singular linear systems that are row rank-deficient. We introduce a new concept of nearly singular property by treating the row space as an unstable subspace in the Grassman manifold. We then define a related important space called the approximate kernel, based on which a robust kernel-augmented Kaczmarz (KaK) is introduced via the subspace correction framework and analyzed by the well-known Xu--Zikatanov identity. To get an implementable version, we further introduce the approximate dual kernel and transform KaK into an equivalent kernel-augmented coordinate descent. Furthermore, we develop an accelerated variant and establish the improved rate of convergence matching the optimal complexity of first-order methods. Compared with existing methods, ours achieve uniform convergence rates for nearly singular linear systems, and the robustness has been confirmed by some numerical tests.",

The proposed approach, which we first present in abstract form, generates a hierarchical sequence of adaptively refined finite-dimensional approximation spaces and employs a (nonlinear) conjugate gradient (CG) method to compute suitable approximations on each space. A core novelty of our approach is that all components of the algorithm are consistently driven by energy reduction principles rather than by classical a posteriori estimators. In particular, adaptive refinement is steered by local energy reduction indicators which aim to construct subsequent approximation spaces in a way that attains the largest potential decrease in energy. Likewise, the stopping criteria for the iterative solver are based on either relative or averaged energy reductions on each subspace. As a concrete realization, we present a concise implementation for $\\mathbb{P}_1$ finite element discretizations of second-order semilinear elliptic diffusion-reaction models, where the local indicators driving the element refinements are computed based on edge-wise energy reductions. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the resulting scheme achieves optimal convergence for various benchmark problems in two-dimensional polygonal domains.",

We assess the method's performance through test problems for smooth and discontinuous solutions of the linear advection equation and the Euler equations of gas dynamics in one space dimension. Results are compared against exact solutions and against numerical results from well-known spatial reconstruction finite volume and DG schemes, with all methods implemented in the fully discrete ADER framework.

While time averages extract transport properties from long stationary trajectories and discard transient dynamics, TTCF adopts the complementary strategy: it exploits the information contained in short-time transients following the onset of an external perturbation, while discarding the long-time evolution once stationarity is reached. We revisit the theoretical framework of TTCF and assess its numerical performance through representative case studies, the Lorentz gas and a many-body system, namely a chain of oscillators with anharmonic pinning potential. By direct comparison with time averages, we show that for the Lorentz gas TTCF yields consistent transport coefficients in both linear and nonlinear regimes at a reduced computational cost. Moreover, the TTCF displays superior precision in the linear-response regime, and remains reliable in non-ergodic situations, revealing the presence of regions of phase space corresponding to different behaviors, as well as the possibility of phase transitions. For the anharmonic chain, we show that TTCF is a scalable and efficient alternative for the numerical study of nonequilibrium transport.",

    "title": "Non-Extreme Individual Minima for Improved Pareto Front Sampling Efficiency and Decision-Making",
    "abstract": "In multi-objective optimization, the set of optimal trade-offs -- the Pareto front -- often contains regions that are extremely steep or flat. The Pareto optimal points in these regions are typically of limited interest for decision-making, as the marginal rate of substitution is extreme: a marginal improvement in one objective necessitates a significant deterioration in at least one other objective. These unfavorable trade-offs frequently occur near the individual minima, where single objectives attain their minimum values without considering the remaining criteria.   To address this, we propose the concept of \\emph{non-extreme individual minima} that relies on the notion of $L$-practical proper efficiency. These points can serve as a less sensitive replacement for \\emph{standard} individual minima in subsequent related methods. Specifically, they allow for a more practical restriction of the Pareto front sampling within a refined utopia-nadir hyperbox, provide a meaningful basis for image space normalization, and can enhance decision-making techniques, such as knee-point methods, by focusing on regions with acceptable trade-offs.   We provide a computationally efficient algorithm to determine these non-extreme individual minima by solving at most $2n_J$ standard weighted-sum scalarizations, where $n_J$ is the number of objectives. To ensure robustness across varying objective scales, the method incorporates an integrated image space normalization strategy. Numerical examples, specifically a convex academic case and a non-convex real-world application, demonstrate that the method successfully excludes practically irrelevant regions in the image space.",

    "title": "Selecting representative community partitions under modularity degeneracy: the STAR method",
    "abstract": "Community detection based on modularity maximization is one of the most widely used approaches for uncovering mesoscale structures in complex networks. However, it is well known that the modularity function exhibits a highly degenerate optimization landscape: a large number of structurally distinct partitions attain close modularity values. This degeneracy raises issues of instability, reproducibility, and interpretability of the detected communities. We propose a simple and user-friendly post-processing method to address this problem by selecting a representative partition among the set of high-modularity solutions. The proposed approach is model-agnostic and can be applied a posteriori to the output of any modularity-based community detection algorithm. Rather than seeking the optimal partition in terms of modularity, our method aims to identify a solution that best represents the structural features shared across degenerate partitions. We compare our approach with consensus clustering methods, which pursue a similar objective, and show that the resulting partitions are highly consistent, while being obtained through a substantially simpler procedure that does not require additional optimization steps or external software packages. Moreover, unlike standard consensus clustering techniques, the proposed method can be applied to networks with both positive and negative edge weights, making it suitable for a wide range of applications involving signed networks and correlation-based systems, such as social, financial, and neuroscience networks. Overall, the method provides a practical and robust tool for handling degeneracy in modularity-based community detection, combining simplicity with broad applicability across different types of networks and real-world problems.",

A logarithmic Sobolev-type inequality is employed to control oscillations in the mass density. Furthermore, by constructing a combined functional that incorporates both the GCP energy and the physical entropy, we derive the exponential decay of solutions. As a byproduct of our approach, we also prove the global existence of $H^2$ solutions for a nonlinear Schrödinger-Langevin equation.   Finally, for GCP solutions that remain bounded away from vacuum, we justify the time-relaxation limit and provide an explicit convergence rate. Our analysis relies on compactness techniques that does not require the existence or smoothness of solutions to the limiting equations. Moreover, our results impose no well-preparedness conditions on the initial data, thereby accommodating the possible formation of an initial layer.",

    "abstract": "Characterizing the geometric boundaries of protein secondary structures is fundamental to understanding macromolecular folding. By applying the discrete Hasimoto map to translate backbone geometry into a one-dimensional discrete nonlinear Schrödinger potential $V_{\\mathrm{re}}[n]$, we establish a frequency-domain framework for protein conformations. Short-time Fourier transform analysis across 320,453 residues from 1,986 non-redundant proteins defines a local spectral entropy $H_{\\mathrm{spec}}$ that consistently orders structural states. Helical segments emerge as narrow-band low-entropy regimes dominated by zero-frequency components, whereas coils manifest as broadband noise. We demonstrate that boundaries separating these states exhibit step-like sharpness characteristic of a first-order-like geometric transition with a sub-residue median width of 0.145 residues. This abrupt kinematic transition provides a spatial counterpart to the cooperative Zimm--Bragg thermodynamic model of helix nucleation. The extreme spatial narrowness exposes an intrinsic limitation governed by the Gabor uncertainty principle, explaining why the pointwise integrability residual $E[n]$ acts as an effective high-pass filter for boundary detection. Guided by this limit we introduce a dual-probe approach combining the high-pass residual for local torsion discontinuities with a low-frequency energy ratio $R_{\\mathrm{LF}}$ measuring the DC-dominated flatness of helical interiors. Unifying these complementary signals improves the detection area under the curve from 0.783 to 0.815. Because high-entropy broadband regions coincide with the flexible loops and hinges implicated in allostery, the spectral entropy of the Hasimoto potential may serve as a sequence-agnostic geometric proxy for mapping functional dynamics from backbone coordinates.",

A unified geometric model is developed, yielding a coupled agent--payload differential--algebraic system that explicitly captures contact wrenches, payload dynamics, and internal force redundancy. A leader--follower architecture is adopted in which a designated leader generates a desired payload wrench based on geometric tracking errors, while the remaining agents realize this wrench through constraint-consistent force allocation.   Unknown disturbances and modeling uncertainties are compensated using Gaussian Process (GP) regression. High-probability bounds on the learning error are explicitly incorporated into the control design, combining GP feedforward compensation with geometric feedback. Lyapunov analysis establishes uniform ultimate boundedness of the payload tracking errors with high probability, with an ultimate bound that scales with the GP predictive uncertainty.",

We establish error bounds relating the approximation quality to the fill distance of collocation points and provide a certification procedure using continuous piecewise affine (CPA) methods. Numerical experiments on benchmark systems, including a polynomial system and the Duffing oscillator, demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",

    "abstract": "We introduce a novel method for estimating the self-similarity index of a general $H$-self-similar process with either stationary or non-stationary increments. The estimation algorithm is developed based on a modified Lamperti transformation, which transforms $H$-self-similar processes to stationary ones. As an application, we show how to use this approach to estimate the self-similarity index of fractional Brownian motion, subfractional Brownian motion, bifractional Brownian motion, and trifractional Brownian motion. Simulation study is performed to support the consistency of our estimators. Implementation in Python is publicly shared.

    "title": "A dual lumping procedure for static condensation in mixed NURBS-based isogeometric elements with optimal convergence rates for arbitrary open knot vectors",
    "abstract": "Locking is a common effect in finite element and isogeometric analysis. In the case of plates, transverse shear locking is most prominent, for shells several other types of locking exist. A common cure are mixed methods that introduce additional fields of unknowns into the variational formulation. These fields reduce constraints and thus alleviate locking significantly. As a drawback, the discretized additional fields increase computational costs significantly. These fields are often eliminated by static condensation, which requires the inverse of a part of the stiffness matrix. In Lagrange-based finite elements, this inverse is computed on element level, due to a discontinuous interpolation of additional fields. Since isogeometric analysis features higher continuity, static condensation must be performed on patch level, which requires a costly matrix inversion on that level. In this contribution, the virtual shear parameters of a mixed isogeometric plate formulation are interpolated by enhanced approximate dual basis functions. This allows to conduct row-sum lumping of the relevant matrix part at a minimal loss of accuracy, since this part becomes diagonal dominant. For a properly chosen integration space, this lumped matrix becomes the identity matrix. Thus, the proposed condensation procedure does not require an inversion anymore. The crucial and novel point is the proposed treatment of knot vectors with limited internal continuity. With the help of several single- and multi-patch examples, both with full and with limited internal continuity, we show that the proposed procedure obtains optimal error convergence rates in all cases, while without these alterations, convergence rates are significantly deteriorated.",

The chamber decomposition of $Δ_{n,2}$ is defined by the admissible polytopes, which can be realized as matroids. In our previous work we described this chamber decomposition by means of the hyperplane arrangement. It is important to note that to any chamber it corresponds the compact space, which is a smooth compact manifold for a chamber of maximal dimension. In this paper we obtain explicit description of the cohomology rings of the symplectic $T^n$ - reductions on $G_{n,2}$ for the standard moment map in terms of the chamber decomposition of $Δ_{n,2}$ and the well known results of Kirwan and Goldin.

The initial object in this category is the Deligne-Mumford compactification $\\overline{\\mathcal{M}}_{0, n}$.

Existing methods usually address only part of this problem, either emphasizing penalized mixed effects modeling without robustness or robust mixed effects estimation without high-dimensional variable selection. We propose a doubly adaptive robust regression (DAR-R) framework for longitudinal linear mixed effects models. It combines a robust pilot fit, doubly adaptive observation weights for residual outliers and leverage points, and folded concave penalization for fixed effect selection, together with weighted updates of random effects and variance components. We develop an iterative reweighting algorithm and establish estimation and prediction error bounds, support recovery consistency, and oracle-type asymptotic normality. Simulations show that DAR-R improves estimation accuracy, false-positive control, and covariance estimation under both vertical outliers and bad leverage contamination. In the TADPOLE/ADNI Alzheimer's disease application, DAR-R achieves accurate and stable prediction of ADAS13 while selecting clinically meaningful predictors with strong resampling stability.",

Within this framework, racemization is modeled as a two-state dynamics on isotopy classes, with an effective rate determined by the presence of mirror-isotopisms. Our main result shows that this rate vanishes if and only if no loop isotopism exists between a loop and its opposite, providing a structural criterion for chirality.

This set has been recently shown to be convex in some practically relevant settings in modern wireless networks, including cell-less networks. However, even under convexity, sum-rate maximization is challenging because the nonlinear spectral radius characterization of the achievable rate region is difficult to handle directly. We overcome this difficulty by exploiting subgradient projections onto the level sets of suitably reformulated spectral radius functions. Notably, the derived subgradient projection algorithm provably converges to the global optimum of the sum-rate maximization problem under the convexity condition.

    "abstract": "We investigate the maximum sum-of-squares (SOS) rank of biquadratic forms in the critical case of $4 \\times 3$ variables, where the general bounds are currently $7 \\leq \\mathrm{BSR}(4,3) \\leq 11$. By analyzing two important structured subclasses, we obtain exact determinations and improved upper bounds that significantly narrow this gap.   For simple biquadratic forms those containing only distinct terms of the type $x_i^2 y_j^2$ we prove that the maximum achievable SOS rank is exactly 7, a value attained by a form corresponding to a $C_4$-free bipartite graph with the maximum number of edges. This settles the question for simple forms.   For $y$-deficient biquadratic forms a class introduced here that permits cross terms among two of the three $y$-variables while the third appears only in pure square terms we prove an upper bound of $9$ by combining Calderön's theorem on $m\\times 2$ forms with the known value $\\mathrm{BSR}(4,2) = 5$.   Our main result is a constructive proof that $\\mathrm{BSR}(4,3) \\geq 8$. We present an explicit non-simple, non-deficient $4\\times 3$ biquadratic form and prove it requires exactly eight squares, thereby improving the general lower bound. This shows that any form achieving a rank higher than $8$ must possess a more complex algebraic structure, and it reduces the search space for determining the true value of $\\mathrm{BSR}(4,3)$. Connections to Zarankiewicz numbers, extremal graph theory, and classical results on sums of squares are highlighted throughout.",

Many developmental processes that involve such cell shape changes, most prominently embryonic cell division, are spatially confined by eggshells. To investigate the potential role of confinement in redirecting active stresses and enabling symmetry breaking phenomena during cell shape transformations, we study a hydrodynamic minimal model in which the cell cortex is represented as an active fluid surface that undergoes symmetric division in the absence of confinement. When enclosed by an ellipsoidal shell, a spontaneous symmetry-breaking transition emerges at a critical degree of confinement, where symmetrically dividing surfaces become unstable and polarized geometries appear. We show that this transition is controlled by the tightness of the confinement and analyze the solution space of stationary surfaces to identify the mechanisms underlying confinement-induced symmetry breaking.",

The main difficulty in the analysis lies in the loss of dissipation in the interaction between the electromagnetic field and the microscopic component, and the weak dissipation induced by the Lorentz force and the scaling with small parameter $ε$. For this, we introduce a velocity weight function and a space-time scaling parameter together with suitable $ε$-dependent energy estimates.",

This paper studies the behaviour of random gravitational and plasma lenses, presenting the refractive and diffractive expansions, with higher-order terms that allow error estimates and embody the counterintuitive resurgence phenomenon.   Specifically, we show that the diffractive expansion converges for a broad class of bounded lens models and provides an efficient description of interference patterns across frequency regimes. Next, building on Picard-Lefschetz techniques, we derive the full refractive expansion to arbitrary order, organising it into a transseries. Near caustics, the standard transseries is supplemented with uniform asymptotics. We study this transseries, with both Borel and hyperasymptotic resummation yielding systematic approximations to lensing integrals at all frequencies. Our results give a framework for modelling wave optics lensing near caustics and beyond the geometric optics approximation and thereby illustrate how tools from resurgence and asymptotic analysis can be applied to practical problems in astrophysics.   Near caustic singularities, the post-refractive corrections diverge, while the uniform asymptotic expansion becomes accurate. We use the leading uniform approximation to derive the strong wave optics suppression of off-axis caustics, which clarifies their subdominant role.",

These properties, in turn, depend critically on the extreme singular values and condition numbers of Gaussian random matrices. For many applications, sharp positive and negative moment bounds for these quantities are required to control expected prediction risk and related performance metrics. Although extensive work provides concentration and tail bounds for extreme singular values of Gaussian random matrices, these results do not readily yield the moment bounds needed in such analyses. Motivated by this gap, we establish non asymptotic moment bounds for arbitrary positive moments of the largest singular value and arbitrary negative moments of the smallest singular value, and uniform bounds for arbitrary positive moments of the condition number of high dimensional Gaussian random matrices. We demonstrate the utility of these bounds by applying them to derive explicit risk guarantees in high dimensional regression and covariance estimation, as well as to obtain bounds on the mean iteration complexity of gradient descent for solving Gram linear systems. Finally, we present counterexamples demonstrating that the positive condition number moment bounds and negative smallest singular value moment bounds cannot, in general, be extended to the broader class of sub Gaussian random matrices.",

We propose surrogate-assisted global sensitivity analysis that combines computational efficiency with a rigorous assessment of parameter influence. In this work, we analyze the recently proposed hybrid-dimensional Stokes--Brinkman--Darcy model, which describes fluid flows in coupled free-flow and porous-medium systems with arbitrary flow directions at the fluid--porous interface. The model results from vertical averaging and contains several unknown parameters. We perform surrogate-assisted global sensitivity analysis using Sobol' indices to investigate the sensitivity of the model to variations of physical parameters for two test cases: filtration and splitting flows. However, constructing surrogates for higher-dimensional random fields requires either many training runs or sophisticated sampling strategies. To address this, we compare polynomial chaos surrogates, including sparse and multi-resolution representations, for their efficiency in global sensitivity analysis, using a predefined Sobol' sequence of training samples. Across the tested cases, multi-resolution approach delivers the most accurate estimation of Sobol' indices.",

    "abstract": "We study the local well-posedness of the solution to a coupled nonlinear elliptic-parabolic system which models electrical discharge in a Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS). A simple MEMS capacitor device contains two plates acting as the capacitor's electrodes, one of which is flexible, and which are separated by a narrow gas-filled gap. In the event of the flexible plate approaching the other, electrical discharge can occur. This is modelled here by two parabolic equations, for densities of electrons and positive ions, and an elliptic equation for electric potential. We show the local-in-time existence of a weak solution for the coupled system. Compactness techniques, used previously in the study of drift-diffusion equations, are employed in our proof.",

These settings bring unique challenges: first, the treatment effects of interest are a high-dimensional vector rather than a low-dimensional scalar; second, positivity violations are often unavoidable; and third, estimation can be based on a smaller effective sample size. We first discuss fundamental limits of estimating effects here, showing that consistent estimation is impossible without further assumptions. We go on to propose a novel sparse pseudo-outcome regression framework for arbitrary high-dimensional statistical functionals, which includes generic constrained regression estimators and error guarantees. We use the framework to derive new doubly robust estimators for mean potential outcomes of high-dimensional treatments, though it can also be applied to other scenarios. We analyze the proposed estimators under exact and approximate sparsity assumptions, giving finite-sample risk bounds. Finally, we derive minimax lower bounds to characterize optimal rates of convergence and show our risk bounds are unimprovable.",

    "abstract": "We propose a reaction--diffusion model of predator--prey interaction in which the predators occupy only a subset of the prey's territory, leaving a predator-free exclusion zone. Ecological examples include marine protected areas where it is illegal to fish, or buffer zones left between the territories of rival predators. The prey are subject to a strong Allee effect, so excessive predation may lead to the extinction of both species. The exclusion zone mitigates this problem by providing the prey with a refuge in which to proliferate without predation. Thus, paradoxically, a smaller predator territory may be able to support a more substantial population than a larger one. Using a topological degree argument, we show in any dimensions that, provided the exclusion zone is large enough, the system possesses spatially heterogeneous coexistence equilibria with positive populations of both species. This result is global in the sense that it does not rely on local bifurcations from semi-trivial stationary states. We also show that as the predator domain becomes asymptotically small, the total predator population does not vanish, and in some cases may actually be maximized in this limit of shrinking predation area. Conversely, we show that as the predator domain becomes large, it may exhibit thresholding behavior, passing suddenly from a regime with coexistence solutions to one in which extinction becomes unavoidable, highlighting the need for careful analysis in the management of predator--prey systems.",

While this problem is now well-understood, determining the escape time for a particle that must exit through a narrow tube has proven challenging. Indeed, relying on analogies with electrodynamics, parameter fits to simulations, and heuristics, a variety of conflicting estimates for this escape time have been offered over the last three decades, some of which are counterintuitive and arguably non-physical. In this paper, we combine matched asymptotic analysis and probabilistic methods to determine the exact asymptotics of the narrow escape time through a tube. We obtain a new escape time formula which reduces to the various prior estimates in certain special cases. If the diffusivity in the tube differs from the diffusivity in the rest of the domain, our results reveal the importance of the form of the multiplicative noise inherent to any diffusivity that varies in space. We discuss our results in the context of asymmetric cell division.",

In parallel, kinetic theory obtains constitutive laws through moment closure, most notably via the Chapman-Enskog expansion.   In this work we establish a connection between these approaches by providing a kinetic interpretation of the Rajagopal-Srinivasa principle of maximal entropy production. For Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook-type kinetics, we show that this principle is equivalent to a minimal relaxation-time principle, selecting among admissible constitutive responses the one with the fastest compatible relaxation toward equilibrium.   We show how the caloric equation of state, entropy balance, and entropy production can be computed from kinetic theory, and we propose a hybrid methodology in which the Chapman--Enskog expansion is used only to compute entropy production and equilibrium thermodynamic relations, while full constitutive closures are obtained through constrained optimization. The proposed hybrid Chapman-Enskog-Rajagopal-Srinivasa approach recovers the standard Euler and Navier-Stokes-Fourier constitutive laws for monatomic gases. We demonstrate how different choices of selection procedure can be more informative than the classical Chapman-Enskog closure in the context of an inviscid compressible Leslie-Ericksen model arising in liquid crystals.",

However, standard Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) faces severe theoretical and numerical challenges when applied to this broader class, particularly regarding non-convexity and instability in sparse regimes. To resolve these issues, this paper introduces a unified estimation framework based on the Fenchel-Young loss. By leveraging the intrinsic convex conjugate structure of PUMs, we demonstrate that the Fenchel-Young estimator guarantees global convexity and bounded gradients, providing a mathematically natural alternative to MLE. Addressing the critical challenge of data scarcity, we further extend this framework via Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Optimization. We first derive an exact finite-dimensional reformulation of the infinite-dimensional primal problem, establishing its theoretical convexity. However, recognizing that the resulting worst-case constraints involve computationally intractable inner maximizations, we subsequently construct a tractable safe approximation by exploiting the global Lipschitz continuity of the Fenchel-Young loss. Through this tractable formulation, we uncover a rigorous geometric unification: two canonical regularization techniques, standard L2-regularization and the margin-enforcing Hinge loss, emerge mathematically as specific limiting cases of our distributionally robust estimator. Extensive experiments on synthetic data and the Swissmetro benchmark validate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms traditional methods, recovering stable preferences even under severe data limitations.",

In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to model selection based on modeling the likelihood values themselves. Specifically, given $K$ candidate models and $n$ observations, we view the $n\\times K$ matrix of negative log-likelihood values as a random data matrix and observe that the expectation of each row is equal to the vector of Kullback--Leibler divergences between the $K$ models and the true DGP, up to an additive constant.

These marginals are defined by a parametric model followed by a semi-parametric B-spline correction to capture complex distributional features. The marginal parameters are spatially smoothed using Gaussian-process priors with low-rank approximations, rendering the computational cost linear in the spatial dimension. When applied to global log-precipitation-rate fields at more than 50,000 grid locations, our stochastic surrogate achieves high fidelity, accurately quantifying the climate distribution's spatial dependence and marginal characteristics, including the tails. Using only 10 training samples, it outperforms a state-of-the-art competitor trained on 80 samples, effectively octupling the computational budget for climate research.

    "abstract": "Switchback experiments--alternating treatment and control over time--are widely used when unit-level randomization is infeasible, outcomes are aggregated, or user interference is unavoidable. In practice, experimentation must support fast product cycles, so teams often run studies for limited durations and make decisions with modest samples. At the same time, outcomes in these time-indexed settings exhibit serial dependence, seasonality, and occasional heavy-tailed shocks, and temporal interference (carryover or anticipation) can render standard asymptotics and naive randomization tests unreliable. In this paper, we develop a randomization-test framework that delivers finite-sample valid, distribution-free p-values for several null hypotheses of interest using only the known assignment mechanism, without parametric assumptions on the outcome process. For causal effects of interests, we impose two primitive conditions--non-anticipation and a finite carryover horizon m--and construct conditional randomization tests (CRTs) based on an ex ante pooling of design blocks into \"sections,\" which yields a tractable conditional assignment law and ensures imputability of focal outcomes. We provide diagnostics for learning the carryover window and assessing non-anticipation, and we introduce studentized CRTs for a session-wise weak null that accommodates within-session seasonality with asymptotic validity. Power approximations under distributed-lag effects with AR(1) noise guide design and analysis choices, and simulations demonstrate favorable size and power relative to common alternatives. Our framework extends naturally to other time-indexed designs.",

    "abstract": "Evaluating sports players based on their performance shares core challenges with evaluating healthcare providers based on patient outcomes. Drawing on recent advances in healthcare provider profiling, we cast sports player evaluation within a rigorous causal inference framework and define a flexible class of causal player evaluation estimands. Using stochastic interventions, we compare player success rates on repeated tasks (such as field goal attempts or plate appearance) to counterfactual success rates had those same attempts been randomly reassigned to players according to prespecified reference distributions. This setup encompasses direct and indirect standardization parameters familiar from healthcare provider profiling, and we additionally propose a \"performance above random replacement\" estimand designed for interpretability in sports settings. We develop doubly robust estimators for these evaluation metrics based on modern semiparametric statistical methods, with a focus on Targeted Minimum Loss-based Estimation, and incorporate machine learning methods to capture complex relationships driving player performance. We illustrate our framework in detailed case studies of field goal kickers in the National Football League and batters in Major League Baseball, highlighting how different causal estimands yield distinct interpretations and insights about player performance.",

    "abstract": "We propose a new and interpretable class of high-dimensional tail dependence models based on latent linear factor structures. Specifically, extremal dependence of an observable vector is assumed to be driven by a lower-dimensional latent $K$-factor model, where $K \\ll d$, thereby inducing an explicit form of dimension reduction. Geometrically, this is reflected in the support of the associated spectral dependence measure, whose intrinsic dimension is at most $K-1$. The loading structure may additionally exhibit sparsity, meaning that each component is influenced by only a small number of latent factors, which further enhances interpretability and scalability. Under mild structural assumptions, we establish identifiability of the model parameters and provide a constructive recovery procedure based on a margin-free tail pairwise dependence matrix, which also yields practical rank-based estimation methods. The framework combines naturally with marginal tail models and is particularly well suited to high-dimensional settings. We illustrate its applicability in a spatial wind energy application, where the latent factor structure enables tractable estimation of the risk that a large proportion of turbines simultaneously fall below their cut-in wind speed thresholds.",

An IEEE technology roadmap for this venture has targeted a linewidth uncertainty of +/- 0.17 nm at 95 % coverage and advised the hybridization of results from different measurement methods to hit this target. Related studies have applied statistical models that require consistent results to compel a lower uncertainty, whereas inconsistent results are prevalent. We illuminate this lurking issue, studying how standard methods of uncertainty evaluation fail to account for the causes and effects of dark uncertainty. We revisit a comparison of imaging and scattering methods to measure linewidths of approximately 13 nm, applying contrasting statistical models to highlight the potential effect of dark uncertainty on hybrid metrology. A random effects model allows the combination of inconsistent results, accounting for dark uncertainty and estimating a total uncertainty of +/- 0.8 nm at 95 % coverage. In contrast, a common mean model requires consistent results for combination, ignoring dark uncertainty and underestimating the total uncertainty by as much as a factor of five. To avoid such titanic overconfidence, which can sink a venture, we outline good practices to reduce dark uncertainty and guide the combination of indeterminately consistent results.",

    "abstract": "Permutation procedures are common practice in hypothesis testing when distributional assumptions about the test statistic are not met or unknown. With only few permutations, empirical p-values lie on a coarse grid and may even be zero when the observed test statistic exceeds all permuted values. Such zero p-values are statistically invalid and hinder multiple testing correction. Parametric tail modeling with the Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD) has been proposed to address this issue, but existing implementations can again yield zero p-values when the estimated shape parameter is negative and the fitted distribution has a finite upper bound.   We introduce a method for accurate and zero-free p-value approximation in permutation testing, embedded in the permApprox workflow and R package. Building on GPD tail modeling, the method enforces a support constraint during parameter estimation to ensure valid extrapolation beyond the observed statistic, thereby strictly avoiding zero p-values. The workflow further integrates robust parameter estimation, data-driven threshold selection, and principled handling of hybrid p-values that are discrete in the bulk and continuous in the extreme tail.   Extensive simulations using two-sample t-tests and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests show that permApprox produces accurate, robust, and zero-free p-value approximations across a wide range of sample and effect sizes. Applications to single-cell RNA-seq and microbiome data demonstrate its practical utility: permApprox yields smooth and interpretable p-value distributions even with few permutations. By resolving the zero-p-value problem while preserving accuracy and computational efficiency, permApprox enables reliable permutation-based inference in high-dimensional and computationally intensive settings.",

Through comprehensive numerical studies, we explore a wide range of statistical applications of the RPD and demonstrate its particular usefulness in uncovering shape features in functional data analysis.

To address this open challenge, we propose Urn Bandit (UNB) process to integrate the reinforcement mechanism of urn probabilistic models with MAB principles, ensuring almost sure convergence of resource allocation to optimal arms. We establish the joint functional central limit theorem (FCLT) for consistent estimators of expected rewards under non-i.i.d., non-sub-Gaussian and sublinear reward samples with pairwise correlations across arms. To overcome the limitations of existing methods that focus mainly on cumulative regret, we establish the asymptotic theory along with adaptive allocation that serves powerful sequential test, such as arms comparison, A/B testing, and policy valuation. Simulation studies and real data analysis demonstrate that UNB maintains statistical test performance of equal randomization (ER) design but obtain more average rewards like classical MAB processes.",

Coherent forecasts of these constrained series are anticipated to conform to their hierarchical structure organized by the aggregation rules. To enhance its resilience against potential irregular series, we explore the robust reconciliation process for hierarchical time series (HTS) forecasting. We incorporate M-estimation to obtain the reconciled forecasts by minimizing a robust loss function of transforming a group of base forecasts subject to the aggregation constraints. The related minimization procedure is developed and implemented through a modified Newton-Raphson algorithm via local quadratic approximation. Extensive numerical experiments are carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, and the results suggest its feasibility in handling numerous abnormal cases (for instance, series with non-normal errors). The proposed robust reconciliation also demonstrates excellent efficiency when no outliers exist in HTS. Finally, we showcase the practical application of the proposed method in a real-data study on Australian domestic tourism.",

Online renewable quantile and expectile regression methods provide valuable tools for detecting such heteroscedasticity by combining current data with summary statistics from historical data. However, quantile regression can be computationally demanding because of the non-smooth check function. To address this, we propose a novel online renewable method based on expectile regression, which efficiently updates estimates using both current observations and historical summaries, thereby reducing storage requirements. By exploiting the smoothness of the expectile loss function, our approach achieves superior computational efficiency compared with existing online renewable methods for streaming data with heteroscedastic variances or inhomogeneous covariate effects. We establish the consistency and asymptotic normality of the proposed estimator under mild regularity conditions, demonstrating that it achieves the same statistical efficiency as oracle estimators based on full individual-level data. Numerical experiments and real-data applications demonstrate that our method performs comparably to the oracle estimator while maintaining high computational efficiency and minimal storage costs.",

    "abstract": "Learning low-dimensional latent representations is a central topic in statistics and machine learning, and rotation methods have long been used to obtain sparse and interpretable representations. Despite nearly a century of widespread use across many fields, rigorous guarantees for valid inference for the learned representation remain lacking. In this paper, we identify a surprisingly prevalent phenomenon that suggests a reason for this gap: for a broad class of vintage rotations, the resulting estimators exhibit a non-estimable bias. Because this bias is independent of the data, it fundamentally precludes the development of valid inferential procedures, including the construction of confidence intervals and hypothesis testing. To address this challenge, we propose a novel bias-free rotation method within a general representation learning framework based on latent variables. We establish an oracle inference property for the learned sparse representations: the estimators achieve the same asymptotic variance as in the ideal setting where the latent variables are observed. To bridge the gap between theory and computation, we develop an efficient computational framework and prove that its output estimators retain the same oracle property. Our results provide a rigorous inference procedure for the rotated estimators, yielding statistically valid and interpretable representation learning.",

    "abstract": "Time-varying covariates in longitudinal studies frequently evolve through reciprocal feedback, undergo role reversal, and reflect unobserved individual heterogeneity. Standard statistical frameworks often assume fixed covariate roles and exogenous predictors, limiting their utility in systems governed by dynamic behavioral or physiological processes. We develop a hierarchical joint modeling framework that unifies three key features of such systems: (i) bidirectional feedback between a binary and a continuous covariate, (ii) role reversal in which these covariates become jointly modeled outcomes at a prespecified decision phase, and (iii) a shared latent trait influencing both intermediate covariates and a final binary endpoint. The model proceeds in three phases: a feedback-driven longitudinal process, a reversal phase in which the two covariates are jointly modeled conditional on the latent trait, and an outcome model linking a binary, decision-relevant endpoint to observed and latent components. Estimation is carried out using maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference, with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo supporting robust posterior estimation for models with latent structure and mixed outcome types. Simulation studies show that the model yields well calibrated coverage, small bias, and improved predictive performance compared to standard generalized linear mixed models, marginal approaches, and models that ignore feedback or latent traits. In an analysis of nationally representative U.S. panel data, the model captures the co-evolution of physical activity and body mass index and their joint influence, moderated by a latent behavioral resilience factor, on income mobility. The framework offers a flexible, practically implementable tool for analyzing longitudinal decision systems in which feedback, covariate role transition, and unmeasured capacity are central to prediction and intervention.",

    "abstract": "A conventional Bayesian approach to prediction uses the posterior distribution to integrate out parameters in a density for unobserved data conditional on the observed data and parameters. When the true posterior is intractable, it is replaced by an approximation; here we focus on variational approximations. Recent work has explored methods that learn posteriors optimized for predictive accuracy under a chosen scoring rule, while regularizing toward the prior or conventional posterior. Our work builds on an existing predictive variational inference (PVI) framework that improves prediction, but also diagnoses model deficiencies through implicit model expansion. In models where the sampling density depends on the parameters through a linear predictor, we improve the interpretability of existing PVI methods as a diagnostic tool. This is achieved by adopting PVI posteriors of Gaussian mixture form (GM-PVI) and establishing connections with plug-in prediction for mixture-of-experts models. We make three main contributions. First, we show that GM-PVI prediction is equivalent to plug-in prediction for certain mixture-of-experts models with covariate-independent weights in generalized linear models and hierarchical extensions of them. Second, we extend standard PVI by allowing GM-PVI posteriors to vary with the prediction covariate and in this case an equivalence to plug-in prediction for mixtures of experts with covariate-dependent weights is established. Third, we demonstrate the diagnostic value of this approach across several examples, including generalized linear models, linear mixed models, and latent Gaussian process models, demonstrating how the parameters of the original model must vary across the covariate space to achieve improvements in prediction.",

    "abstract": "We identify a fundamental pathology in the likelihood for time delay inference which challenges standard inference methods. By analysing the likelihood for time delay inference with Gaussian process light curve models, we show that it generically develops a boundary-driven \"W\"-shape with a global maximum at the true delay and gradual rises towards the edges of the observation window. This arises because time delay estimation is intrinsically extrapolative. In practice, global samplers such as nested sampling are steered towards spurious edge modes unless strict convergence criteria are adopted. We demonstrate this with simulations and show that the effect strengthens with higher data density over a fixed time span. To ensure convergence, we provide concrete guidance, notably increasing the number of live points. Further, we show that methods implicitly favouring small delays, for example optimisers and local MCMC, induce a bias towards larger $H_0$. Our results clarify failure modes and offer practical remedies for robust fully Bayesian time delay inference.",

    "abstract": "This paper develops a class of Bayesian non- and semiparametric methods for estimating regression curves and surfaces. The main idea is to model the regression as locally linear, and then place suitable local priors on the local parameters. The method requires the posterior distribution of the local parameters given local data, and this is found via a suitably defined local likelihood function. When the width of the local data window is large the methods reduce to familiar fully parametric Bayesian methods, and when the width is small the estimators are essentially nonparametric. When noninformative reference priors are used the resulting estimators coincide with recently developed well-performing local weighted least squares methods for nonparametric regression.   Each local prior distribution needs in general a centre parameter and a variance parameter. Of particular interest are versions of the scheme that are more or less automatic and objective in the sense that they do not require subjective specifications of prior parameters. We therefore develop empirical Bayes methods to obtain the variance parameter and a hierarchical Bayes method to account for uncertainty in the choice of centre parameter. There are several possible versions of the general programme, and a number of its specialisations are discussed. Some of these are shown to be capable of outperforming standard nonparametric regression methods, particularly in situations with several covariates.",

    "abstract": "Estimating heterogeneous treatment effects is central to data-driven decision-making, yet industrial applications often face a fundamental tension between limited randomized controlled trial (RCT) budgets and abundant but biased observational data collected under historical targeting policies. Although observational logs offer the advantage of scale, they inherently suffer from severe policyinduced imbalance and overlap violations, rendering standalone estimation unreliable. We propose a budgeted active experimentation framework that iteratively enhances model training for causal effect estimation via active sampling. By leveraging observational priors, we develop an acquisition function targeting uplift estimation uncertainty, overlap deficits, and domain discrepancy to select the most informative units for randomized experiments. We establish finite-sample deviation bounds, asymptotic normality via martingale Central Limit Theorems (CLTs), and minimax lower bounds to prove information-theoretic optimality. Extensive experiments on industrial datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms standard randomized baselines in cost-constrained settings.",

    "abstract": "Adaptive designs dynamically update treatment probabilities using information accumulated during the experiment. Existing theory for causal inference from adaptive experiments primarily assumes the superpopulation framework with independent and identically distributed units, and may not apply when the distribution of units evolves over time. This paper makes two contributions. First, we extend the literature to the finite-population framework, which allows for possibly nonexchangeable units, and establish the design-based theory for causal inference under general adaptive designs using inverse-propensity-weighted (IPW) and augmented IPW (AIPW) estimators. Our theory accommodates nonexchangeable units, both nonconverging and vanishing treatment probabilities, and nonconverging outcome estimators, thereby justifying inference using AIPW estimators with black-box outcome models that integrate advances from machine learning methods. To alleviate the conservativeness inherent in variance estimation under finite-population inference, we also introduce a covariance estimator for the AIPW estimator that becomes sharp when the residuals from the adaptive regression of potential outcomes on covariates are additive across units. Our framework encompasses widely used adaptive designs, such as multi-armed bandits, covariate-adaptive randomization, and sequential rerandomization, advancing the design-based theory for causal inference in these specific settings. Second, as a methodological contribution, we propose an adaptive covariate adjustment approach for analyzing even nonadaptive designs. The martingale structure induced by adaptive adjustment enables valid inference with black-box outcome estimators that would otherwise require strong assumptions under standard nonadaptive analysis.",

Since edge presence corresponds to a nonzero entry of the precision matrix, estimation of this proportion can be formulated as a large-scale multiple testing problem. We propose an estimator that combines p-values from simultaneous edge-wise tests, conducted under false discovery rate control, with Storey's estimator of the proportion of true null hypotheses. We establish weak dependence conditions on the precision matrix under which the empirical cumulative distribution function of the p-values converges to its population counterpart. These conditions cover high-dimensional regimes, including those arising in genetic association studies. Under such dependence, we characterize the asymptotic bias of the Schweder--Spjøtvoll estimator, showing that it is upward biased and thus slightly underestimates the true edge proportion.

    "abstract": "A kidney transplant can improve the life expectancy and quality of life of patients with end-stage renal failure. Even more patients could be helped with a transplant if the rate of kidneys that are discarded and not transplanted could be reduced. Machine learning (ML) can support decision-making in this context by early identification of donor organs at high risk of discard, for instance to enable timely interventions to improve organ utilization such as rescue allocation. Although various ML models have been applied, their results are difficult to compare due to heterogenous datasets and differences in feature engineering and evaluation strategies. This study aims to provide a systematic and reproducible comparison of ML models for donor kidney discard prediction. We trained five commonly used ML models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Deep Learning along with an ensemble model on data from 4,080 deceased donors (death determined by neurologic criteria) in Germany. A unified benchmarking framework was implemented, including standardized feature engineering and selection, and Bayesian hyperparameter optimization. Model performance was assessed for discrimination (MCC, AUC, F1), calibration (Brier score), and explainability (SHAP). The ensemble achieved the highest discrimination performance (MCC=0.76, AUC=0.87, F1=0.90), while individual models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Deep Learning performed comparably and better than Decision Trees. Platt scaling improved calibration for tree-and neural network-based models. SHAP consistently identified donor age and renal markers as dominant predictors across models, reflecting clinical plausibility. This study demonstrates that consistent data preprocessing, feature selection, and evaluation can be more decisive for predictive success than the choice of the ML algorithm.",

    "abstract": "p-hacking occurs when researchers conduct multiple significance tests (e.g., p1;H0,1 and p2;H0,2) and then selectively report tests that yield desirable (usually significant) results (e.g., p2 < 0.05;H0,2) without correcting for multiple testing (e.g., 0.05/2 = 0.025). In the present article, I consider p-hacking in the context of two philosophies of significance testing - the error statistical approach and the formal inference approach. I argue that although p-hacking inflates Type I error rates in the error statistical approach, it does not inflate them in the formal inference approach. Specifically, in the error statistical approach, the \"actual\" familywise error rate (e.g., 1 - [1 - 0.05]2 = 0.098 for two tests) is relevant because it covers both the selectively reported and unreported tests in the \"actual\" test procedure (i.e., p1;H0,1 and p2;H0,2). In this approach, Type I error rate inflation occurs because the \"actual\" error rate (0.098) is higher than the nominal error rate (0.05). In contrast, in the formal inference approach, the \"actual\" familywise error rate is irrelevant because (a) the researcher does not report a statistical inference about the corresponding intersection null hypothesis (i.e., H0,1 intersect H0,2), and (b) the \"actual\" familywise error rate does not license inferences about the reported individual hypotheses (i.e., H0,2). Instead, in the formal inference approach, only the nominal error rate is relevant, and a comparison with the \"actual\" error rate is inappropriate. Implications for conceptualizing, demonstrating, and reducing p-hacking are discussed.",

Methods such as capture-recapture are widely used, but rely on assumptions that are often violated and not feasible in specific applications. We describe a Bayesian modelling approach called Multi-Parameter Estimation of Prevalence (MPEP). The MPEP approach leverages routinely collected administrative data, starting from a large baseline cohort of individuals from the population of interest and linked events, to estimate the full size of the target population. When multiple event types are included, the approach enables checking of the consistency of evidence about prevalence from different event types. Additional evidence can be incorporated where inconsistencies are identified. In this article, we summarize the general framework of MPEP, with focus on the most recent version, with improved computational efficiency (implemented in STAN). We also explore several extensions to the model that help us understand the sensitivity of the results to modelling assumptions or identify potential sources of bias. We demonstrate the MPEP approach through a case study estimating the prevalence of opioid dependence in Scotland each year from 2014 to 2022.",

This work studies the problem of estimating connection probabilities in multi-layer networks and introduces a new Multi-layer Iterative Connection Probability Estimation (MICE) method. The proposed approach employs an iterative framework that jointly refines inter-layer and intra-layer similarity sets by dynamically updating distance metrics derived from current probability estimates. By leveraging both layer-level and node-level neighborhood information, MICE improves estimation accuracy while preserving computational efficiency. Theoretical analysis establishes the consistency of the estimator and shows that, under mild regularity conditions, the proposed method achieves an optimal convergence rate comparable to that of an oracle estimator. Extensive simulation studies across diverse graphon structures demonstrate the superior performance of MICE relative to existing methods. Empirical evaluations using brain network data from patients with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and global food and agricultural trade network data further illustrate the robustness and effectiveness of the method in link prediction tasks. Overall, this work provides a theoretically grounded and practically scalable framework for probabilistic modeling and inference in multi-layer network systems.",

We developed a method to construct indicators for the degree of sample overlap in evidence synthesis of studies based on existing data. Our method is rooted in set theory and is based on the coding of the ranges of several well selected sample characteristics, offers a practical solution by focusing on making inference based on sample characteristics rather than on individual participant data. Useful information, such as the overlap-free sample set with the largest sample size in an evidence synthesis, can be derived from this method. We applied our model to several real-world evidence syntheses, demonstrating its effectiveness and flexibility.

This is accomplished typically by granting accelerated approval based on a surrogate endpoint that can be measured earlier than a traditional approval endpoint. Minimal residual disease (MRD) is a sensitive measure of residual cancer cells in hematology oncology after treatment, and is increasingly considered as a secondary or exploratory endpoint due to its prognostic potential for traditional clinical trial endpoints such as progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). This work aims to evaluate MRD's surrogacy potential across several hematologic cancer indications while keeping the focus on follicular lymphoma (FL), using data from published studies.

The Nash equilibrium is characterized by a coupled Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman/Kolmogorov system across degree classes. An important feature of the SEIR setting is the exposed compartment: the incubation period separates infection from infectiousness and changes incentives after infection occurs. In the baseline formulation, exposed agents optimally maintain full contact, while susceptible agents reduce contact according to an explicit best-response rule driven by infection pressure and the value gap. We also discuss extensions that yield nontrivial exposed precaution by introducing responsibility or compliance incentives. We establish existence of equilibrium via a fixed-point argument and prove the uniqueness under a suitable monotonicity condition. The analysis identifies a delay in the onset of precaution under longer incubation, which can lead to weaker behavioral responses and larger outbreaks. Numerical experiments illustrate how network degree and the cost exponent shape equilibrium policies and epidemic outcomes.",

We find that, without directional information on which way to turn, behavioural strategies which make sudden turns perform better than gradual steering. We see various transitions where a different strategy becomes optimal, such as a switch from reversing direction to fully re-orienting tumbles as more information becomes available.

    "abstract": "Generalizable protein function prediction is increasingly constrained by the growing mismatch between exponentially expanding sequences of environmental proteins and the comparatively slow accumulation of experimentally verified functional data. Active learning offers a promising path forward for accelerating biological function prediction, by selecting the most informative proteins to experimentally annotate for data-efficient training, yet its potential remains largely unexplored. We introduce HATTER (Human-in-the-loop Adaptive Toolkit for Transferable Enzyme Representations), a modular framework that integrates multiple active learning strategies with human-in-the-loop experimental annotation to efficiently fine tune function prediction models. We compare active learning training to standard supervised training for biological enzyme function prediction, demonstrating that active learning achieves performance comparable to standard training across diverse protein sequence evaluation datasets while requiring fewer model updates, processing less data, and substantially reducing computational cost. Interestingly, point-based uncertainty sampling methods like entropy or margin sampling perform as well or better than more complex acquisition functions such as bayesian sampling or BALD, highlighting the relative importance of sequence diversity in training datasets and model architecture design. These results demonstrate that human-in-the-loop active learning can efficiently accelerate enzyme discovery, providing a flexible platform for adaptive, scalable, and expert-guided protein function prediction.",

We propose that the ribosome originated as a mutualistic symbiont of an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase ribozyme, supplying peptides that enhanced replication. As life transitioned from the RNA to the RNA-protein world, autonomous replicators became irreversibly addicted to the ribosome for producing replication proteins. Subsequent evolution is construed as a ribosomal takeover, whereby the ribosome evolved to consume most of the resources of the cell, while other cellular componentry ensured the propagation of the ribosome. Under this perspective, the ribosome is the ultimate biological selfish element.",

    "abstract": "Dale's Principle has historically guided neuroscience research as a valuable rule of thumb, namely that all synapses on each neuron release the same set of neurotransmitters. Most existing Spiking Neuron Network models share this dichotomous assumption that neurons are either excitatory or inhibitory; however, recent experimental evidence points towards co-release mechanisms that violate this assumption. Here, we introduce a minimal model of \"Bilingual\" neurons violating Dale's principle that can exert both excitatory and inhibitory effects. We identify parameter regimes in which this architecture exhibits transitions between synchronous and asynchronous dynamics that differ quantitatively from those observed in a matched monolingual control architecture. We report distinct information-processing signatures both at the level of neurons and higher-order interactions between them near the phase transitions. These results suggest that the population of neurons violating Dales principle may provide an alternative mechanism for regulating large-scale oscillatory activity in neural circuits.",

Here, we link cell- and tissue-scale mechanics by constructing mean-field rheological relations for the vertex model. In contrast to past work in the field, we study a vertex model with an explicit viscous friction. We also include two different cellular mechanisms creating active, anisotropic stresses. Our mean-field model accounts for cell shape and the non-linear elastic and visco-plastic regimes. We validate our results by predicting the response to large-amplitude oscillatory shear. There are several vertex model variants, and comparing to results from the literature, we show that their rheology depends on a number of model details. Our approach should be sufficiently general to construct non-linear mean-field constitutive relations for any cell-based tissue model.",

Experiment and simulation have shown that these developing networks eventually exhibit bursting behavior in which the entire culture participates for short periods of time, with inter-burst intervals in which the network is comparatively quiescent. This paper extends previous simulation results by examining the spatiotemporal patterns of such bursting. We show that these bursts originate at a small number of network locations and propagate as waves of activity. We demonstrate that this type of activity does not require fine tuning of neuron or network parameters. We also examine how this activity changes during development and the dependence of such activity and its triggering on both local and global network properties.",

Among camelid species, polygyny is a prevalent behavioral strategy that encompasses both mating and foraging activities. This group-level behavior has multiple interacting dimensions, contributing to an interesting ecological and evolutionary complexity. We developed an individual-based stochastic model in which camelid females transition between different familial groups in response to their environmental conditions, aiming to maximize individual fitness. Our results indicate that the behavioral strategy of individual females can shape, by itself, emergent population-level properties, including group size and fitness distribution. Furthermore, these properties are modulated, in a non-additive manner, by other factors such as population density, sex ratio and system heterogeneity.",

Cultivation and isolation of non-model microbes remains a major challenge, despite advances in high-throughput culturomic methods.

Given an annotated genome, metabolic modelling can be used to predict source nutrients required for the growth of a microbe, which acts as an initial screen to inform culture and isolation experiments. This chapter provides an overview of metabolic networks and modelling and how they can be used to predict the nutrient requirements of a microorganism, followed by a sample protocol using a toy metabolic network, which is then expanded to a genome-scale metabolic network application. These methods can be applied to any metabolic network of interest--which in turn can be created from any genome of interest--and are a starting point for experimental validation of source nutrients required for microorganisms that remain uncultivated to date.",

Using a two-dimensional active foam model, we compare the effects of traction forces and junctional tension fluctuations on confluent tissue dynamics. While these two modes of activity produce qualitatively different cell shapes, rearrangement statistics, and spatiotemporal correlations in fluid states, we find that the long-time cellular motion universally converges to persistent Brownian dynamics. This universal feature contrasts with the non-universal correlations between cell geometry, rearrangement rate, and fluidity, which depend sensitively on the underlying modes of active force. Our results demonstrate that persistent Brownian motion provides a minimal framework for describing tissue dynamics, while distinct active forces leave identifiable structural and dynamical signatures, thereby enabling inference of the dominant active force in fluid state tissues.",

    "abstract": "Sensory information propagates through successive processing stages in the brain, where synaptic weight patterns between stations determine how downstream neurons decode information from upstream populations. Although optimized synaptic connectivity can enhance information transmission, it requires precise weight tuning. Recent evidence depicting substantial synaptic volatility raises two fundamental questions: How does coarse-tuning of synaptic connectivity affect information transmission? What strategies could the nervous system employ to maintain reliable communication despite synaptic fluctuations? We addressed these questions by analyzing the signal-to-noise ratio ($SNR$) for binary stimulus discrimination under two decoding schemes: a naive population average and an optimized linear decoder. For the naive decoder, we found that $SNR$ remains largely insensitive to synaptic imprecision, since performance is already limited by correlated noise in neuronal responses. For the optimal decoder, we identified three distinct regimes. Under weak coarse-tuning, $SNR^2$ scales linearly with population size $N$. Under moderate coarse-tuning, scaling becomes sublinear. Under strong coarse-tuning, the regime most consistent with observed neuronal heterogeneity, $SNR$ saturates and can not be improved by recruiting larger populations. This limitation persists even when incorporating feedforward or recurrent network architectures. These findings suggest that in the biologically relevant regime of strong coarse-tuning, naive and optimal decoders can achieve qualitatively similar performance. The analysis shows that effective readout under synaptic volatility is constrained to an invariant low-dimensional manifold aligned with the naive decoder, potentially pointing to a fundamental principle for robust neural computation in the face of ongoing synaptic remodeling.",

    "abstract": "The difficulty with control of population dynamics, besides the states being positive and the control having to also be positive, is the extreme difference in the dynamics near extinction and at overpopulated states. As hard as global stabilization is, even harder is finding CLFs that are strict, don't require LaSalle arguments, and permit quantification of convergence. Among the three canonical types of two-population dynamics (mutualism, which borders on trivial, predator-prey, and competition, which makes global stabilization with positive harvesting impossible), predator-prey is the ``sweet spot'' for the study of stabilization. Even when the predator-prey interaction is neutrally stable, global asymptotic stabilization with strict CLFs has proven very difficult, except by conservative, hard-to-gain-insight-from Matrosov-like techniques.   In this little note we show directions for the design of clean, elegant, insight-bearing, majorization-free strict CLFs. They generalize the classical Volterra-style Lyapunov functions for population dynamics to non-separable Volterra-style constructions. As a bonus to strictification as an analysis activity, we provide examples of concurrent designs of feedback and CLFs, using customized versions of forwarding and backstepping (note that, in suitable coordinates, predator-prey is both strict-feedforward and strict-feedback), where the striking deviations from these methods' conventional forms is necessitated by the predator-prey's states and inputs needing to be kept positive.",

To address this gap, we integrate a unique, high-resolution network of human movements in New Zealand with a metapopulation model to mechanistically simulate pathogen transmission. We calibrate the model on the nationwide 2010 kiwifruit vine disease (Psa-V) outbreak, and show that it accurately reproduces the observed spatiotemporal spread, confirming that the human mobility network is a strong foundation for modeling transmission dynamics. By analyzing spatial infection trends, we find that most dispersal occurs locally, as often illustrated in the plant-outbreak literature. However, sporadic long-range connections are necessary to model a nationwide outbreak. Using the model as an in-silico laboratory, we demonstrate that enhanced surveillance accelerates detection and that outbreak severity is highly sensitive to the timing and location of initial disease importation. We observe a potential causal link between seasonal labor patterns and epidemic risk in high-traffic seasons. This study provides a robust, data-driven framework for modeling and predicting the spatiotemporal spread of agricultural pathogens. It underscores the importance of leveraging human mobility networks to design timely interventions and surveillance systems, protecting global food security.",

Still, high-fidelity subject-specific FEA is too computationally expensive for large-cohort, multi-condition, near-real-time use. Existing MeshGraphNet-style surrogates mainly rely on stacked local message passing, which is often insufficient for modeling long-range dependencies and limits interpretability. This study benchmarked a deep-stacked baseline model against three explicit region-interaction architectures. Using a 90° change-of-direction task and a strict cross-subject evaluation framework, we assessed whole-field error, peak stress fidelity, and hotspot spatial consistency under matched computational budgets. Region-interaction models significantly reduced whole-field nodal stress errors compared to the purely stacked baseline. Crucially, they achieved markedly higher accuracy in reconstructing the high-stress tail and demonstrated superior spatial consistency and temporal robustness in localizing high-risk stress hotspots. Explicit region-level interaction provides a more structure-aligned surrogate modeling paradigm for knee contact mechanics and yields stronger risk-relevant stress phenotype recovery under comparable computational budgets, while supporting more interpretable injury-risk assessment.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic-weight AMMs (aka Temporal Function Market Makers, TFMMs) implement algorithmic asset allocation, analogous to index or smart beta funds, by continuously updating pools' weights. A strategy updates target weights over time, and arbitrageurs trade the pool back toward those weights. This creates a sequence of small, predictable mispricings that grow until taken, effectively executing rebalances as a series of Dutch reverse auctions. Prior theoretical and simulation work (Willetts & Harrington, 2024) predicted that this mechanism could outperform CEX-style rebalancing. We test that claim on two live pools on the QuantAMM protocol, one on Ethereum mainnet and one on Base, across two short rebalancing windows six months apart (July 2025 and January 2026). We perform block-level arbitrage analysis, and then measure long term outcomes using Loss-vs-Rebalancing (LVR) and Rebalancing-vs-Rebalancing (RVR) benchmarks. On mainnet, rebalancing becomes markedly more efficient over time (more frequent arbitrage trades with lower value extracted per trade), reaching performance comparable to or better than CEX-based models. On Base, rebalancing persists even when per-trade extraction is near (or below) zero, consistent with routing-driven execution, and achieves efficiencies that meet or exceed standard \"perfect rebalancing\" LVR baselines. These results demonstrate dynamic-weight AMMs as a competitive execution layer for tokenised funds, with superior performance on L2s where routing and lower data costs compress arbitrage spreads.",

    "abstract": "We propose a signal temporal logic (STL)-based framework that rigorously verifies the feasibility of a mission described in STL and synthesizes control to safely execute it. The proposed framework ensures safe and reliable operation through two phases. First, the proposed framework assesses the feasibility of STL by computing a backward reachable tube (BRT), which captures all states that can satisfy the given STL, regardless of the initial state. The proposed framework accommodates the multiple reach-avoid (MRA) problem to address more general STL specifications and leverages a deep neural network to alleviate the computation burden for reachability analysis, reducing the computation time by about 1000 times compared to a baseline method. We further propose a layered planning and control architecture that combines mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) for global planning with model predictive control (MPC) as a local controller for the verified STL. Consequently, the proposed framework can robustly handle unexpected behavior of obstacles that are not described in the environment information or STL, thereby providing reliable mission performance. Our numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed framework can successfully compute BRT for a given STL and perform the mission.",

A key challenge lies in designing differential beamformers that are continuously steerable and capable of enhancing target signals arriving from arbitrary directions. This paper studies the design of differential beamformers for circular arrays and proposes a novel framework that incorporates directional derivative constraints. By constraining the first-order derivatives of the beampattern at the desired steering direction to zero and assigning suitable values to higher-order derivatives, the beamformer is ensured to achieve its maximum response in the target direction and provide sufficient beam steering. This approach not only improves steering flexibility but also enables a more intuitive and robust beampattern design.

    "title": "Digital Twin-Based Beamforming for Interference Mitigation in AF Relay MIMO Systems",
    "abstract": "Beamforming in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems should take interference mitigation into account. However, for beamform design, accurate channel state information (CSI) is needed, which is often difficult to obtain due to channel variability, feedback overhead, or hardware constraints. For example, amplify-and-forward (AF) relays passively forward signals without measurement, precluding full CSI acquisition to and from the relay. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel prediction-assisted optimization (PAO) framework for beamform design in AF relay-assisted multiuser MIMO systems. The proposed solution in the AF relay aims at maximizing the signal-plus-interference-to-noise ratio (SINR). Unlike other methods, PAO relies solely on received power measurements, making it suitable for scenarios where CSI is unreliable or unavailable. PAO consists of two stages: a supervised-learning-based neural network (NN) that predicts the positions of transmitters using signal observations, and an optimization algorithm, guided by a digital twin (DT), that iteratively refines the beam direction of the relay in a simulated radio environment. As a key contribution, we validate the proposed framework using realistic measurements collected on a custom-built experimental millimeter wave (mmWave) platform, which enables training of the NN model under practical wireless conditions. The estimated information is then used to update the digital twin with knowledge of the surrounding environment, enabling online optimization. Numerical results show the trade-off between localization accuracy and beamforming performance and confirm that PAO maintains robustness even in the presence of localization errors while reducing the need for real-world measurements.",

    "abstract": "Emerging applications such as autonomous driving and industrial automation demand ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC), where maintaining fresh and timely information is critical. A key performance metric in such systems is the age of information (AoI). This paper addresses AoI minimization in a multi-user uplink wireless network using non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), where users offload tasks to a base station. The system must handle user heterogeneity in task sizes, AoI thresholds, and penalty sensitivities, while adhering to NOMA constraints on user scheduling. We propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework based on proximal policy optimization (PPO), enhanced with a Transformer encoder. The attention mechanism allows the agent to focus on critical user states and capture inter-user dependencies, improving policy performance and scalability. Extensive simulations show that our method reduces average AoI compared to baselines. We also analyze the evolution of attention weights during training and observe that the model progressively learns to prioritize high-importance users. Attention maps reveal meaningful structure: early-stage policies exhibit uniform attention, while later stages show focused patterns aligned with user priority and NOMA constraints. These results highlight the promise of attention-driven DRL for intelligent, priority-aware resource allocation in next-generation wireless systems.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces CSI-RFF, a new framework that leverages micro-signals embedded within Channel State Information (CSI) curves to realize Radio-Frequency Fingerprinting of commodity off-the-shelf (COTS) WiFi devices for open-set authentication. The micro-signals that serve as RF fingerprints are termed ``micro-CSI''. Through experimentation, we have found that the presence of micro-CSI can primarily be attributed to imperfections in the RF circuitry. Furthermore, this characteristic signal is detectable in WiFi 4/5/6 network interface cards (NICs). We have conducted further experiments to determine the most effective CSI collection configurations to stabilize micro-CSI. Yet, extracting micro-CSI for authentication purposes poses a significant challenge. This complexity arises from the fact that CSI measurements inherently include both micro-CSI and the distortions introduced by wireless channels. These two elements are intricately intertwined, making their separation non-trivial. To tackle this challenge, we have developed a signal space-based extraction technique for line-of-sight (LoS) scenarios, which can effectively separate the distortions caused by wireless channels and micro-CSI. Over the course of our comprehensive CSI data collection period extending beyond one year, we found that the extracted micro-CSI displays unique characteristics specific to each WiFi device and remains invariant over time. This establishes micro-CSI as a suitable candidate for device fingerprinting. Finally, we conduct a case study focusing on area access control for mobile robots. Our experimental results demonstrate that the micro-CSI-based authentication algorithm can achieve an average attack detection rate close to 99% with a false alarm rate of 0% in both static and mobile conditions when using 20 CSI measurements to construct one fingerprint.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning (DL)-based joint source-channel coding (JSCC) methods have achieved remarkable success in wireless image transmission. However, these methods either focus on conventional distortion metrics that do not necessarily yield high perceptual quality or incur high computational complexity. In this paper, we propose two DL-based JSCC (DeepJSCC) methods that leverage deep generative architectures for wireless image transmission. Specifically, we propose G-UNet-JSCC, a scheme comprising an encoder and a U-Net-based generator serving as the decoder. Its skip connections enable multi-scale feature fusion to improve both pixel-level fidelity and perceptual quality of reconstructed images by integrating low- and high-level features. To further enhance pixel-level fidelity, the encoder and the U-Net-based decoder are jointly optimized using a weighted sum of structural similarity and mean-squared error (MSE) losses. Building upon G-UNet-JSCC, we further develop a DeepJSCC method called cGAN-JSCC, where the decoder is enhanced through adversarial training. In this scheme, we retain the encoder of G-UNet-JSCC and adversarially train the decoder's generator against a patch-based discriminator. cGAN-JSCC employs a two-stage training procedure. The outer stage trains the encoder and the decoder end-to-end using an MSE loss, while the inner stage adversarially trains the decoder's generator and the discriminator by minimizing a joint loss combining adversarial and distortion losses. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve superior pixel-level fidelity and perceptual quality on both high- and low-resolution images. For low-resolution images, cGAN-JSCC achieves better reconstruction performance and greater robustness to channel variations than G-UNet-JSCC.",

    "abstract": "How much energy, money, and emissions can advanced control of heating and cooling equipment save in real buildings? To address this question, researchers sometimes control a small number of thermal zones within a larger multi-zone building, then report savings for the controlled zones only. That approach can overestimate savings by neglecting heat transfer between controlled zones and adjacent zones. This paper mathematically characterizes the overestimation error when the dynamics are linear and the objectives are linear in the thermal load, as usually holds when optimizing energy efficiency, energy costs, or emissions. Overestimation errors can be large even in seemingly innocuous situations. For example, when controlling only interior zones that have no direct thermal contact with the outdoors, all perceived savings are fictitious. This paper provides an alternative estimation method based on the controlled and adjacent zones' temperature measurements. The new method does not require estimating how much energy the building would have used under baseline operations, so it removes the additional measurement and verification challenge of accurate baseline estimation.",

    "abstract": "Small, low-size, weight, power, and cost (SWaP-C) uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly used for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions due to their affordability, attritability, and suitability for distributed operations. However, their design poses challenges including limited endurance, constrained payload capacity, and reliance on simple sensing modalities such as fixed-field-of-view, bearing-only cameras. Traditional platform-centric methods cannot capture the coupled performance, cost, and coordination trade-offs that emerge at the system-of-systems level.   This paper presents a mission engineering framework for early-phase design of low-SWaP-C UAV ISR architectures. The framework integrates design of experiments, multi-objective optimization, and high-fidelity simulation into a closed-loop process linking design variables to estimator-informed performance and mission cost. Candidate architectures are explored via Latin hypercube sampling and refined using a genetic algorithm, with performance evaluated through Monte Carlo trials of a federated Kalman filter benchmarked against the posterior Cramer-Rao lower bound. Validation follows the Validation Square methodology, combining theoretical, empirical, and structural assessments.   A case study on man-overboard localization in a GNSS-denied maritime environment shows that localization accuracy saturates at sub-meter levels, while higher-cost configurations primarily add redundancy and resilience. The framework thus quantifies mission trade-offs between performance, affordability, and robustness, providing a scalable decision-support tool for contested, resource-constrained ISR missions.",

    "title": "Full Waveform Inversion using the Wasserstein metric for ultrasound transducer array based NDT",
    "abstract": "Ultrasonic imaging methods often assume linear direct models, while in reality, many nonlinear phenomena are present, e.g. multiple reflections. A family of imaging methods called Full Waveform Inversion (FWI), which has been developed in the field of seismic imaging, uses full acoustic wave simulations as direct models, taking into account virtually all nonlinearities, which can ultimately enhance the accuracy of ultrasonic imaging. However, the problem of cycle skipping -- the existence of many local minima of the Least Squares (L2) misfit function due to the oscillatory nature of the signals -- is worsened when FWI is applied to ultrasound data because of a lack of low-frequency components. In this paper, we explore the use of the squared Wasserstein (W2) Optimal Transport Distance as the metric for the misfit between the acquired and the synthetic data, applying the method to Nondestructive Evaluation with ultrasonic phased arrays. An analytical continuous time-domain derivation of the adjoint acoustic field related to the W2 misfit is presented and used for the computation of the gradients. To cope with the computational burden of FWI, we apply a low-memory strategy that allows for the computation of the gradients without the storage of the full simulated fields. The GPU implementation of the method (in CUDA language) is detailed, and the source code is made available. Six prototypical cases are presented, and the corresponding sound speed maps are reconstructed with FWI using both the L2 and the W2 misfit functionals. In five of the six cases, the pixel-wise sum of squared errors obtained with W2 was at least one order of magnitude lower than that obtained with W2, with an increase in the gradient computation time not exceeding 2\\%. The results highlight both the adequacy of the W2 misfit for ultrasonic FWI with phased arrays and its computational feasibility.",

    "abstract": "Accurate and efficient uncertainty quantification is essential for resilience assessment of modern power systems under high impact and low probability disturbances. Data driven sparse polynomial chaos expansion (DDSPCE) provides a computationally efficient surrogate framework but may suffer from ill conditioned regression and loss of accuracy in the distribution tails that determine system risk. This paper studies the impact of regression weighting schemes on the stability and tail accuracy of DD-SPCE surrogates by introducing a tempered Christoffel weighted least squares (T-CWLS) formulation that balances numerical stability and tail fidelity. The tempering exponent is treated as a hyperparameter whose influence is examined with respect to distributional accuracy compared with Monte Carlo simulations. Case studies on distribution system load shedding show that the proposed method reduces 95th percentile deviation by 16%, 5th percentile deviation by 6%, and improves the regression stability index by over 130%. The results demonstrate that controlling the weighting intensity directly influences both stability index and the accuracy of tail prediction.",

    "abstract": "A novel non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) based low-delay service framework is proposed for fog radio access networks (F-RANs). Fog access points (FAPs) leverage NOMA for local delivery of cached content, while the cloud access point employs NOMA to simultaneously push content to FAPs and directly serve users. Based on this model, a delay minimization problem is formulated by jointly optimizing user association, cache placement, and power allocation. To address this non-convex mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem, an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm is developed, which decomposes the original problem into two subproblems, namely joint user association and cache placement, and power allocation. In particular, a low-complexity algorithm is designed to optimizing the user association and cache placement strategy using the McCormick envelope theory and Lagrangian partial relaxation. The power allocation is optimized by invoking the successive convex approximation. Simulation results reveal that: 1) the proposed AO-based algorithm effectively balances between the achieved performance and computational efficiency, and 2) the proposed NOMA-based F-RANs framework significantly outperforms orthogonal multiple access-based F-RANs systems in terms of average transmission delay in different scenarios.",

    "abstract": "Future wireless networks, deploying thousands of antenna elements, may operate in the radiative near-field (NF), enabling spatial multiplexing across both angle and range domains. Sparse arrays have the potential to achieve comparable performance with fewer antenna elements. However, fixed sparse array designs are generally suboptimal under dynamic user distributions, while movable antenna architectures rely on mechanically reconfigurable elements, introducing latency and increased hardware complexity. To address these limitations, we propose a reconfigurable array thinning approach that selectively activates a subset of antennas to form a flexible sparse array design without physical repositioning. We first analyze grating lobes for uniform sparse arrays in the angle and range domains, showing their absence along the range dimension. Based on the analysis, we develop two particle swarm optimization-based strategies: a grating-lobe-based thinned array (GTA) for grating- lobe suppression and a sum-rate-based thinned array (STA) for multiuser sum-rate maximization. Simulation results demonstrate that GTA outperforms conventional uniform sparse arrays, while STA achieves performance comparable to movable antennas, thereby offering a practical and efficient array deployment strategy without the associated mechanical complexity.",

    "abstract": "Conventional far-field multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels are limited to a single spatial degree of freedom (DoF) under a line-of-sight (LoS) condition. In contrast, the radiative near field (NF) supports multiple spatial DoF, enabled by spherical wavefronts and the reduced spatial footprint at short ranges. While recent research indicates that the effective DoF (EDoF) increases in NF, experimental validation and clear identification of the transition distances remain limited. In this letter, we develop an intuitive framework for characterizing the EDoF of a ULA-based MIMO system and derive two complementary analytical expressions: a closed-form formulation that relates the EDoF to the physical transmit beamwidth and receive aperture, and a discrete formulation based on the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) domain angular decomposition of the NF spherical wavefront, which is well suited for experimental evaluation. We further introduce the effective MIMO Rayleigh distance (EMRD) and the maximum spatial multiplexing distance (MSMD), which mark the distances where the EDoF reduces to one and attains its maximum, respectively. Experimental measurements using widely spaced phased arrays closely match the theoretical EDoF trends and validate the proposed distance metrics.",

    "abstract": "With the deployment of large antenna arrays at high-frequency bands, future wireless communication systems are likely to operate in the radiative near-field. Unlike far-field beam steering, near-field beams can be focused on a spatial region with a finite depth, enabling spatial multiplexing in the range dimension. Moreover, in the line-of-sight MIMO near-field, multiple spatial degrees of freedom (DoF) are accessible, akin to a scattering- rich environment. In this paper, we derive the beamdepth for a generalized uniform rectangular array (URA) and investigate how the array geometry influences near-field beamdepth and its limits. We define the effective beamfocusing Rayleigh distance (EBRD), to present a near-field boundary with respect to beamfocusing and spatial multiplexing gains for the generalized URA. Our results demonstrate that under a fixed element count constraint, the array geometry has a strong impact on beamdepth, whereas this effect diminishes under a fixed aperture length constraint. Moreover, compared to uniform square arrays, elongated configurations such as uniform linear arrays (ULAs) yield narrower beamdepth and extend the effective near-field region defined by the EBRD. Building on these insights, we design a polar codebook for compressed-sensing-based channel estimation that leverages our findings. Simulation results show that the proposed polar codebook achieves a 2 dB NMSE improvement over state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we present an analytical expression to quantify the effective spatial DoF in the near-field, revealing that they are also constrained by the EBRD. Notably, the maximum spatial DoF is achieved with a ULA configuration, outperforming a square URA in this regard.",

With the ongoing deployment of intelligent transportation systems (ITSs) and increasing vehicle connectivity, the integration of traffic information has become crucial for improving both energy efficiency and thermal comfort in modern vehicles. To enhance fuel economy, this paper proposes a novel traffic-aware hierarchical integrated thermal and energy management (TA-ITEM) strategy for connected HEVs. In the upper layer, global reference trajectories for battery state of charge (SOC) and cabin temperature are planned using traffic flow speed information obtained from ITSs. In the lower layer, a real-time model predictive control (MPC)-based ITEM controller is developed, which incorporates a novel Transformer-based speed predictor with driving condition recognition (TF-DCR) to enable anticipatory tracking of the reference trajectories. Numerical simulations are conducted under various driving cycles and ambient temperature conditions. The results demonstrate that the proposed TA-ITEM approach outperforms conventional rule-based and MPC-SP approaches, with average fuel consumption reductions of 56.36\\% and 5.84\\%, respectively, while maintaining superior thermal regulation and cabin comfort. These findings confirm the effectiveness and strong generalization capability of TA-ITEM and underscore the advantages of incorporating traffic information.",

Subject presence in the imaging region will lead to substantial noise increases, yet the dominant coupling mechanism remains insufficiently characterized. We develop a lumped-parameter circuit model of the coupled environment-body-receiver system. The model indicates that ambient time-varying electric fields induce a body common-mode potential, which is converted into differential-mode noise through capacitive imbalance between the head and the receive-coil terminals, yielding strong dependence on subject position and geometry. Circuit analysis, simulations, and controlled experiments support the model, with predicted imbalance consistent with measured noise variations. Guided by this mechanism, we implement a capacitive low-impedance bypass to clamp the body potential, achieving an approximately 3.5-fold SNR improvement on a 50 mT prototype. The proposed model offers a compact circuit-based tool for analyzing and mitigating human body-coupled electric-field interference in portable ULF-MRI.",

    "abstract": "By leveraging the distributed leakage radiation of leaky coaxial cables (LCXs), the concept of pinching antennas can be generalized from the conventional high-frequency waveguide based architectures to cable based structures in lower-frequency scenarios. This paper investigates an LCX based generalized pinching-antenna system with dual-port feeding. By enabling bidirectional excitation along each cable, the proposed design significantly enhances spatial degrees of freedom. A comprehensive channel model is developed to characterize intra-cable attenuation, bidirectional phase progression, slot based radiation, and wireless propagation. Based on this model, both analog and hybrid beamforming frameworks are studied with the objective of maximizing the minimum achievable data rate. For analog transmission, slot activation, port selection, and power allocation are jointly optimized using matching theory, coalitional games, and bisection based power control. For hybrid transmission, zero-forcing (ZF) digital precoding is incorporated to eliminate inter-user interference, thereby simplifying slot activation and enabling closed-form optimal power allocation. Simulation results demonstrate that dual-port feeding provides notable performance gains over single-port LCX systems and fixed-antenna benchmarks, validating the effectiveness of the proposed beamforming and resource allocation designs under various transmit power levels and cable parameters.",

This procedure helps reduce data-to-pilot interference through data averaging. Moreover, it is demonstrated that fractional delays and Dopplers of the multipath components can be estimated by correlating the integrated delay and Doppler profiles with the corresponding delay/Doppler terms.

The heterogeneity in delay constraints and UE mobility introduces resource allocation conflicts and imbalances, which undermine communication reliability and challenge NA. Although unified resource allocation (URA) can mitigate these issues, it remains unclear whether NA can be sustained under such diverse conditions. To address this, we derive expressions for the lower bound (LB) on NA in AHetNets under URA. Our analysis reveals that extended heterogeneity significantly degrades the LB due to resource limitations-even when the heterogeneity stems from additional services under less stringent delay constraints (LSDC) or from UEs with lower mobility. To overcome this degradation, we formulate and solve a joint optimization problem for the number of UEs sharing time-frequency resources ($K$) and pilot length ($ξ$), aiming to enhance the LB by improving spatial, frequency, and temporal resource efficiency. Simulation results validate our analysis and demonstrate that jointly optimizing $K$ and $ξ$ enables AHetNets to achieve the target NA under greater heterogeneity, outperforming existing resource allocation policies.",

    "abstract": "A recurring theme in optimal controller design for wireless networked control systems (WNCS) is the reliance on real-time channel state information (CSI). However, acquiring accurate CSI a priori is notoriously challenging due to the time-varying nature of wireless channels. In this work, we propose a pilot-free framework for optimal control over wireless channels in which control commands are generated from plant states together with control-aided channel prediction. For linear plants operating over an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) architecture, channel prediction is performed via a Kalman filter (KF), and the optimal control policy is derived from the Bellman principle. To alleviate the curse of dimensionality in computing the optimal control policy, we approximate the solution using a coupled algebraic Riccati equation (CARE), which can be computed efficiently via a stochastic approximation (SA) algorithm. Rigorous performance guarantees are established by proving the stability of both the channel predictor and the closed-loop system under the resulting control policy, providing sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of a stabilizing approximate CARE solution, and establishing convergence of the SA-based control algorithm. The framework is further extended to nonlinear plants under general wireless architectures by combining a KalmanNet-based predictor with a Markov-modulated deep deterministic policy gradient (MM-DDPG) controller. Numerical results show that the proposed pilot-free approach outperforms benchmark schemes in both control performance and channel prediction accuracy for linear and nonlinear scenarios.",

Conventional codebook-based methods offer low training overhead but suffer from limited angular resolution and sensitivity to hardware impairments. To address these challenges, we propose a deep learning-enhanced super-resolution beam alignment framework with three key components. First, we design the Quaternary Search-based Super-Resolution (QSSR) algorithm, which leverages the monotonic power ratio property between two discrete Fourier transform (DFT) codebook beams to achieve super-resolution angle estimation without increasing measurement complexity relative to binary search. Second, we develop QSSR-Net, a gated recurrent unit-based neural network that exploits sequential multi-layer beam measurements to capture angular dependencies, thereby improving estimation accuracy, robustness to noise, and generalization across diverse propagation environments. Third, to mitigate the adverse effects of hardware impairments such as antenna position and phase errors, we propose a parametric self-calibration method that requires no additional hardware overhead and adapts compensation parameters in real time. Simulation results show that the proposed framework consistently outperforms binary search and even exhaustive search at high signal-to-noise ratios, achieving substantial performance gains while maintaining low overhead.",

    "abstract": "Accurate channel state information (CSI) is vital for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. However, superimposed pilots (SIP), which reduce overhead, introduce severe pilot contamination and data interference, complicating joint channel estimation and data detection. This paper proposes a conditional flow matching receiver (CFM-Rx), an unsupervised generative framework that learns directly from received signals, eliminating the need for labeled data and improving adaptability across diverse system settings. By leveraging flow-based generative modeling, CFM-Rx enables deterministic, low-latency inference and exploits model invertibility to capture the bidirectional nature of signal propagation. This framework unifies flow matching with score-based diffusion modeling via a moment-consistent ordinary differential equation (ODE), replacing stochastic differential equation (SDE) sampling with a deterministic and efficient process. Furthermore, it integrates receiver-side priors to ensure stable, data-consistent inference. Extensive simulation results across various MIMO configurations demonstrate that CFM-Rx consistently outperforms conventional estimators and state-of-the-art data-driven receivers, achieving notable gains in channel estimation accuracy and symbol detection robustness, particularly under severe pilot contamination.",

    "abstract": "This paper aims to design multiple access (MA) schemes to improve the max-min fairness (MMF) for pinching antennas (PAs)-based multigroup multicast communications, where PA placement and resource allocation are jointly optimized. Specifically, three MA schemes are considered to facilitate the multicast transmission: i) treating interference as noise (TIN), ii) non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), and iii) time-division multiple access (TDMA) with two PA reconfiguration protocols, namely pinching switching (PS) and pinching multiplexing (PM). i) For TIN, a closed-form solution is derived for optimal power allocation, while a sequential element-wise optimization (SEO) is developed for the PA placement. ii) For NOMA, a recursive power allocation framework incorporating a bisection search is developed, and a hierarchical objective evaluation (HOE) mechanism is incorporated to simplify the SEO process for PA location update. iii) For TDMA, the PS protocol allows the PA locations to be optimized separately using the SEO method, after which the time-power allocation is solved as a convex problem with a global optimum. Under the PM protocol, the PA locations are jointly optimized with the time-power resources through a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT)-based analytical solution. Numerical results demonstrate that: i) the pinching-antenna system (PASS) architecture significantly outperforms traditional fixed-antenna systems. ii) TDMA-PS achieves superior performance by fully leveraging the flexible PA reconfiguration and benefiting from interference-free transmission, whereas TIN serves as a practical lower-bound solution due to its simplicity despite its limited performance. iii) NOMA consistently outperforms TDMA-PM and, in high transmit power regimes with heterogeneous multicast group distributions, can even surpass the performance achieved by TDMA-PS.",

    "abstract": "Most existing studies achieve beamforming by adjusting the positions of pinching antennas (PAs) and typically model PAs as isotropic radiators. However, under the dielectric scatterer model, the PA radiation pattern depends on its geometry. This letter investigates the radiation patterns of PAs with different geometries through full-wave simulations and measurements, and demonstrates how geometry influences the radiation directivity. In addition, an arc-shaped PA is introduced to enable transmit-direction control in PA systems. A PA system prototype consisting of a dielectric waveguide, waveguide transitions, and a PA element is proposed. Prototype measurements are used to validate the simulations and to characterize the directivity of square and triangular PAs, and the measurement procedure can be applied to obtain radiation patterns for PAs with general geometries. The simulation and measurement results jointly demonstrate that PA geometry is critical in PA systems because it influences the radiation characteristics significantly.",

    "abstract": "It has been shown that WiFi devices enable sensing of environments and targets through their channel state information. However, the same devices have not been used for delay-synchronous channel sounding due to challenges related to the stability of synchronization and lack of reference power levels. Due to factors such as uncertainty in symbol reception timing, impulse responses are discontinuous across acquisitions. The present paper addresses the challenges to perform delay-synchronous channel sounding using off-the-shelf multiple-antenna IEEE 802.11ax WiFi devices, referred to as SoundiFi. Stable delay synchronization and power level reference are realized by remoting the antennas with coaxial cables and devoting one of the antennas as a reference channel, with which the gain and delay of other simultaneous channels are defined. Indoor experiments confirmed that the impulse response becomes continuous across successive acquisitions and provide the absolute delay. The impulse response has a noise level at -115 dB, indicating the maximum path gain value that can be measured with the devices. The impulse response also revealed the existence of long-delayed multipaths up to 132 m propagation distance in a reverberant 30-m-long corridor.",

    "abstract": "While the rapid proliferation of electric vehicles (EVs) accelerates net-zero goals, uncoordinated charging activities impose severe operational challenges on distribution grids, including exacerbated peak loads, thermal overloading, and voltage violations. To overcome the computational intractability of jointly optimizing grid infrastructure reinforcements and battery energy storage system (BESS) installations, this paper proposes a novel three-stage diagnosis-driven co-planning (DDCP) framework. The methodology integrates a violation detection and quantification (VDQ) model to systematically identify system breaches, and a violation-mitigated BESS planning (VMBP) model for optimal BESS sitting and sizing. Specifically, Stage I of the DDCP framework diagnoses critical bottleneck lines that render standalone BESS solutions infeasible. Stage II targets cable upgrades exclusively at the Top-N prioritized bottleneck lines and Stage III then executes the optimal BESS deployment using a network-enhanced VMBP model. Furthermore, this study quantifies the EV hosting capacity thresholds before and after BESS integration across varying EV adoption rates and base voltages. Finally, a comprehensive comparative analysis evaluates four mitigation approaches: the VDQ-driven cable upgrade (VCU) model, the VMBP model, system-wide voltage uprating, and the proposed DDCP framework. The results demonstrate that the DDCP framework not only resolves the complex joint-optimization hurdle but also achieves the high techno-economic superiority in addressing high-EV-penetration challenges.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the optimal real-time fusion of data collected by multiple sensors. In our set-up, the sensor measurements are considered to be private and are jointly correlated with an underlying process. A fusion center combines the private sensor measurements and releases its output to an honest-but-curious party, which is responsible for estimating the state of the underlying process based on the fusion center's output. The privacy leakage incurred by the fusion policy is quantified using Rényi differential privacy. We formulate the privacy-aware fusion design as a constrained finite-horizon optimization problem, in which the fusion policy and the state estimation are jointly optimized to minimize the state estimation error subject to a total privacy budget constraint. We derive the constrained optimality conditions for the proposed optimization problem and use them to characterize the structural properties of the optimal fusion policy. Unlike classical differential privacy mechanisms, the optimal fusion policy is shown to adaptively allocates the privacy budget and regulates the adversary's belief in a closed-loop manner. To reduce the computational burden of solving the resulting constrained optimality equations, we parameterize the fusion policy using a structured Gaussian distribution and show that the parameterized fusion policy satisfies the privacy constraint. We further develop a numerical algorithm to jointly optimize the fusion policy and state estimator. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed fusion framework through a traffic density estimation case study.",

    "abstract": "Multi-image super-resolution (MISR) is a critical technique for satellite remote sensing. In the perspective of information, twin-image super-resolution (TISR) is regarded as the most challenging MISR scenario, having crucial applications like the SPOT-5 supermode imaging. In TISR, an image is super-resolved by its subpixel-shift counterpart (i.e., twin image), where the two images are typically offset by half a pixel both horizontally and vertically. We formulate the less investigated TISR using a convex criterion, which is implemented using a novel deep unfolding network. In the unfolding, an embedded simple shift operator trickily addresses the coupled TISR data-fitting terms, and a transformer trained with a convex self-similarity loss function elegantly implements the proximal mapping induced by the TISR regularizer. The proposed convex self-similarity unfolding supermode super-resolution (COSUP) algorithm is interpretable and achieves state-of-the-art performance with very fast millisecond-level computational time. COSUP is also tested on real-world data, for which the subpixel shifts would not be spatially uniform, with results showing great superiority over the official CNES supermode imaging product in terms of credible metrics (e.g., natural image quality evaluator, NIQE).

    "abstract": "Extremely large antenna arrays and high-frequency operation are two key technologies that advance performance metrics such as higher data rates, lower latency, and wider coverage in sixth-generation communications. However, the adoption of these technologies fundamentally changes the characteristics of wavefronts, forcing communication systems to operate in the near-field region. The transition from planar far-field communications to spherical near-field propagation necessitates novel channel estimation algorithms to fully exploit the unique features of spherical wavefronts for advanced transceiver design. To this end, we propose a novel semi-gridless channel estimation approach based on a variational Bayesian (VB) inference framework. Specifically, we reformulate the near-field channel model for both uniform linear arrays and uniform planar arrays into separate direction-of-arrival (DoAs) and distance components. Building on these new representations, we employ a gridless approach for DoAs estimation using a von Mises distribution, and a coarse-to-fine grid search for distance estimation. We then develop a semi-gridless variational Bayesian (SG-VB) algorithm with efficient update rules that enables accurate channel reconstruction. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed SG-VB algorithm, demonstrating enhanced near-field channel reconstruction accuracy and superior estimation performance for both DoAs and distance components embedded in near-field channels.",

Applying the result to repeated games with public+conditionally independent private monitoring, all equilibria without private randomization are perfect public equilibria, and non-trivial belief free equilibria are impossible. This result can be avoided if information is slightly correlated, or pay-off relevant. Due to undesirable properties of public perfect equilibria in some settings, I argue for further study of belief-based equilibria to understand equilibria of repeated games with noisy monitoring.",

While MSE-optimized predictors are accurate in tracking levels, they sacrifice dynamic lead, causing them to lag behind changing targets. To address this, we introduce two `look-ahead' frameworks--Decoupling-from-Present (DFP) and Peak-Correlation-Shifting (PCS)--and provide closed-form solutions for their optimization. Notably, the classical MSE predictor is shown to be a special case within these frameworks. Dually, our methods achieve maximum advancement for any given accuracy level, so our approach reveals the complete efficient frontier of the accuracy-timeliness trade-off, whereas MSE represents only a single point. We also derive a universal upper bound on lead over MSE for any linear predictor under a consistency constraint and prove that our methods hit this ceiling. We validate this approach through applications in forecasting and real-time signal extraction, introducing a leading-indicator criterion and tailored linear benchmarks.",

A continuum of producers operate Cobb-Douglas technologies with regime-specific productivity $A_j \\in \\{A_L, A_H\\}$. Stochastic arrival of signaling opportunities and skill obsolescence risk generate an optimal stopping problem -- when to pay a lump-sum cost $φ$ to upgrade productivity -- whose solution yields an endogenous Skiba threshold $k^*$. Diminishing returns create a stable interior attractor in each regime; the signaling cost separates the two basins, producing a poverty trap that is an interior optimum rather than a corner solution. The stationary distribution exhibits Twin Peaks, but its decomposition by regime reveals that agents in three distinct states -- structurally trapped, waiting to signal, and successfully upgraded -- coexist at the same wealth levels with different consumption behavior and mobility prospects. Capital alone is therefore insufficient to identify an agent's position in the polarization dynamics. We show that the joint observation of a low marginal propensity to consume out of wealth and a high average propensity to consume -- a combination invisible to standard Euler equation tests -- is the diagnostic signature of the structural trap, distinguishing it from both liquidity constraints and transitory shocks.",

    "abstract": "Given the challenge of achieving societal welfare in an environmentally sustainable way, the Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare (ISEW) has emerged as an alternative indicator of progress in response to critiques of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The ISEW compares the benefits of economic activity with its social and environmental costs. So far, most studies empirically analyse the ISEW for past developments, while no studies have simulated the ISEW using a dynamic macroeconomic model. We address this important gap by incorporating the ISEW into COMPASS, an ecological macroeconomic model that features the Doughnut of biophysical boundaries and social thresholds. First, we analyse how the ISEW is affected by three social and environmental policies: a carbon tax, income redistribution, and working-time reduction. We find that the ISEW grows in all scenarios. The strongest improvement over business-as-usual arises when all policies are combined, while the individual policies mostly affect the ISEW positively. Only in the case of working-time reduction, the ISEW decreases. Our study underscores the benefit of dynamically modelling the ISEW for anticipating the net effect of multiple impulses and their interconnections on the indicator. Second, we explore how the ISEW compares to GDP and the Doughnut when evaluating social and environmental policies. Our results suggest that the ISEW is better than GDP at capturing their effects, but it omits the full environmental costs of growth. We argue that the Doughnut, with its comprehensive picture of biophysical boundaries and social thresholds, provides better guidance for policymakers striving for sustainable wellbeing.",

When the discriminatory power of the Tullock winner-selection mechanism is no greater than $2/(n+1)$, a unique equilibrium arises where each player exerts deterministic and identical effort across all dimensions. This condition applies uniformly to all eligible prize allocation rules and all levels of players' asymmetry, and it is tight. Under this condition, we derive the effort-maximizing prize allocation rule: the entire prize is awarded to the player who wins more battles than his opponent by a pre-specified margin, and the prize is split equally if neither player does. When $n$ is odd, and players are symmetric, the majority rule is optimal.",

We determine the probability that IRV selects the weakest candidate under the impartial anonymous culture and impartial culture models of voter behavior, and use Monte Carlo simulations to estimate these probabilities under several spatial models. We also examine this question empirically using a large dataset of real elections. Our results show that IRV can select the weakest candidates under each of these definitions, but such outcomes are generally rare.

Indirect effects transmitted through the estimated network account for about 28% of the total impact of key firm balance-sheet characteristics. By contrast, distance-based networks generate no statistically discernible spillovers, while a priori firm- or industry-based networks substantially overstate within-group spillins relative to the data-driven network. These findings show that who is linked to whom, and with what strength, matters critically for assessing systemic environmental risk and for designing targeted regulation.

    "abstract": "Recent experiments on temporal reflection in transmission line metamaterials and theoretical treatments of dispersive time-varying media have unearthed the fundamental role of modulation mechanisms on the interface conditions, underpinning the introduction of passive photonic time crystals with stable momentum band gaps. Drawing from these concepts, it is shown that temporal metamaterials with simultaneous passive permittivity and permeability switching exhibit wideband absorption with impedance-matching, effectively behaving as one-dimensional perfectly matched layers. Under the effective medium theory, the loss mechanism is attributed to the emergent effective electric and magnetic conductivities, which are used to derive an approximate matching condition for asynchronous modulation and to engineer lossy material properties. The proposed approach and its performance beyond the Rozanov bound are verified with semi-analytical calculations as well as full-wave simulations, and the possibility of realizing a two-dimensional temporal perfectly matched layer is discussed.",

Practical demonstrations of this mechanism, however, have been limited to simple configurations such as slabs and spheres, where analytical solutions allow accurate prediction of the complex-frequency scattering zeros. Here, we extend this concept into the realm of metasurfaces and demonstrate coherent virtual absorption in realistic and dispersive metasurface configurations. Through a combination of full-wave analysis and rational approximation, we present a practical scheme to identify suitable complex-frequency zeros and achieve coherent virtual absorption successfully. Our approach can be implemented in arbitrary metasurface configurations with any number of ports, providing a robust framework for optimized energy storage, memories, optical sensing, and modulation in practical photonic systems.",

Here, we report a geometry - defined metal--semiconductor--metal homojunction in bilayer blue phosphorus (BlueP) created by a localized bubble corrugation, without chemical doping or foreign - material interfaces. First - principles calculations show that enlarging the interlayer separation in the metallic A\\(_1\\)B\\(_1\\) - stacked BlueP bilayer opens a band gap, enabling a semiconducting barrier embedded between metallic segments. First - principles quantum - transport simulations reveal a crossover from ballistic to tunneling transport upon bubble formation. In the tunneling regime, transmission decreases exponentially with bubble width while remaining weakly sensitive to bubble height and bulging direction. The junction acts as an orientation - dependent \\(k\\) - space filter, producing transport anisotropy and momentum selectivity. Orbital - resolved scattering analysis shows that intralayer - bonding channels persist under deformation whereas interlayer - hybridized channels are quenched, and that σ- type bonding yields higher conductance than π- type bonding.

    "abstract": "Primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) generated in the early Universe may leave observable imprints in the present-day large-scale structure. However, it remains unclear on which spatial scales primordial signatures can survive the nonlinear processes accompanying structure formation. The aim of this study is to investigate the evolution of PMFs during gravitational collapse and to determine the spatial scales on which primordial signatures can persist. We perform a suite of high-resolution direct numerical simulations of self-gravitating, magnetized halos. By varying the viscosity, we probe different Reynolds-number regimes and follow the coupled evolution of gravitational collapse and magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. At sufficiently high Reynolds numbers, turbulence generated during collapse triggers the onset of a small-scale dynamo, which amplifies magnetic energy below the Jeans scale and modifies the magnetic energy spectrum significantly. Whether dynamo amplification dominates the magnetic field evolution is determined by the competition between the dynamo growth time and the free-fall time. Our results highlight the importance of resolving the Jeans scale and the associated turbulent inertial range in cosmological MHD simulations to accurately capture the interplay between gravitational compression and dynamo amplification and to assess which structures retain memory of primordial fields.",

    "abstract": "The recent, rapid advances in nonlinear chipscale nanophotonics in the visible and near-infrared have been largely driven by manipulating the local dielectric environment proximate to decades-old workhorse bulk nonlinear optical materials, rather than increasing the inherent strength of their nonlinear response. While proposed decades ago, we demonstrate the first experimental realization of a new class of designer nonlinear materials that leverage the interband optical transition in asymmetric structures to provide strong second order susceptibility, $χ^{(2)}$. Using simple AlGaAs/GaAs coupled quantum wells operating in the near-infrared as a prototype, we observed strong second harmonic generation enhancement of 1550 nm to 775 nm over bulk controls. Extracted $χ^{(2)}$ values were as high as 2750 pm/V, which is $>$7x that of bulk GaAs. Furthermore, measured susceptibilities agreed well with quantum mechanical calculations of $χ^{(2)}$ using layer profiles extracted from electron microscopy. Growth interruptions were employed to improve interfacial abruptness in response to electron microscopy characterization, resulting in increased $χ^{(2)}$ toward the simulation predictions for ideal heterointerfaces. More complex layer designs showed predicted $χ^{(2)}$ up to 7 nm/V. Such materials are anticipated to find myriad applications, including entangled photon generation at telecommunications wavelengths for chipscale quantum information processing.",

    "abstract": "Atomistic simulations are widely used to investigate reactive processes but are often limited by the rare event problem due to kinetic bottlenecks. We recently introduced an enhanced sampling approach based on the committor function, machine-learned following a variational principle. This method combines a transition-state-oriented bias potential, expressed as a functional of the committor, with a metadynamics-like bias along a committor-based collective variable, enabling uniform exploration of reaction pathways. In its original formulation, the committor is represented by a neural network that takes physical descriptors as input and is trained by minimizing a functional involving gradients with respect to atomic coordinates, which can be computationally demanding in some cases. Here, we propose a simplified learning criterion formulated entirely in the descriptor space, which bypasses the need for explicit and costly coordinate gradients and provides a relaxed upper bound to the original variational principle. Although this approach does not formally target the exact committor, we show that it retains robust sampling performance while significantly reducing computational costs, thus enabling the study of processes that would be practically unfeasible using the original formulation.",

However, the training of these models generally requires a large amount of data, often precluding the use of expensive high-level ab initio simulations for this task. The generation of coordination compounds of Dy with large magnetic anisotropy represents a topical example, where multireference simulations of large molecules are necessary to perform reliable predictions. Here, we show that a semi-supervised chemically-inspired training-by-proxy of generative variational autoencoders can reduce the cost associated with building a training set from multireference simulations by two orders of magnitude. We illustrate the power of this approach by generating 100s of new organic ligands for Dy(III) pentagonal bipyramidal complexes exhibiting record values of magnetic anisotropy, while starting from datasets as small as 1k multireference calculations. This work thus paves the way to the computational generation of molecules as complex coordination compounds with target electronic and magnetic properties.",

    "abstract": "A peculiar electron correlation effect, leading to orbital rotation upon ionization, theoretically predicted long ago, was never experimentally characterized. The effect is expected to appear prominently in the photoionization of chiral molecules, due to the lack of symmetry constraints to wave-functions mixing. This is observed to have a profound effect on the photoelectron dynamics, as here demonstrated by investigating \\b{eta} asymmetry parameters and partial cross-section observables in the Cl 3p Cooper minimum region of epichlorohydrin, a chiral prototype system. Angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy with tunable synchrotron radiation allowed measuring Cooper minimum $β$ oscillations, which were observed for solely two valence photoionization channels. The nature and number of channels exhibiting such dynamical behavior, along with the extent of the observed oscillation amplitudes, could not be accounted for by predictions based on Hartree-Fock (HF) and Density Functional Theory (DFT). These features could only be explained by incorporating correlation effects, which mix single-hole configurations of identical symmetry, in the characterization of the four lowest-lying molecular cation states, via equation-of-motion coupled cluster singles and doubles Dyson orbitals.",

We propose, in this work, a novel and data-efficient means of learning temperature dependence into ML CG force-fields via training on the thermal response forces of the PMF.

In this work, we demonstrate how a generative diffusion model can be used to uncover previously unknown solutions of a nonlinear partial differential equation: the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations in a turbulent regime. Trained on data from a direct numerical simulation of turbulence, the model learns to generate time series that resemble physically plausible trajectories. By carefully modifying the temporal structure of the model and enforcing the symmetries of the governing equations, we produce synthetic trajectories that are periodic in time, despite the fact that the training data did not contain periodic trajectories. These synthetic trajectories are then refined into true solutions using an iterative solver, yielding 111 new periodic orbits (POs) with very short periods. Our results reveal a previously unobserved richness in the PO structure of this system and suggest a broader role for generative AI: not as replacements for simulation and existing solvers, but as a complementary tool for navigating the complex solution spaces of nonlinear dynamical systems.",

Existing systems rely on table-top bulk-optic components -- discrete lasers, reference cavities, isolators, modulators and frequency shifters -- limiting portability, scalability, and manufacturability. While these systems offer flexibility in laser design to tailor linewidth, frequency noise, and wavelength to specific applications, fully integrating a stabilized laser onto a chip without sacrificing performance and versatility has remained elusive. Here, we report integration of the precision stabilized laser in the low-loss silicon nitride photonic platform, combining a flexible isolator-free core laser design with a modulation-free stabilization cavity. We demonstrate a stabilized widely tunable self-isolating extended cavity tunable laser monolithically integrated with an on-chip coil-loaded Mach-Zehnder interferometer (CL-MZI). This design yields a fundamental linewidth of 1.7 - 10.5 Hz across a 60 nm tuning range, integral linewidth of 299 - 505 Hz over a 30 nm tuning range, frequency noise reduction of over 5 orders of magnitude, and an Allan-Deviation (ADEV) of 6.5x10-13 at 0.08 ms. We next highlight the versatility of this approach by demonstrating a self-isolating stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) laser, that provides nonlinear noise suppression of high frequency noise by multiple orders of magnitude, stabilized to an on-chip CL-MZI. The stabilized SBS laser achieves 4 Hz fundamental linewidth, 74 Hz integral linewidth, and ADEV of 2.8x10-13 at 5 ms. These results bring the performance and versatility of table-top stabilized laser systems to a chip for the first time, providing a path to scalable, low-cost, and manufacturable precision lasers for portable quantum, sensing, and communications applications.",

    "abstract": "This work presents a numerical investigation of soot formation in the Cambridge lab-scale gas turbine combustor. Large-eddy simulations (LES) of a swirl-stabilized ethylene flame are performed using the flamelet generated manifold method coupled with a discrete sectional model to account for soot formation, growth, and oxidation. The study aims to elucidate the mechanism governing the spatial structure and intermittency of soot, supported by comparisons with experimental data. The predicted soot distribution agrees well with measurements, with peak concentrations near the bluff body. Flow recirculation is identified as the key mechanism driving soot accumulation in fuel-rich regions, where surface reactions dominate soot mass growth. Soot intermittency arises from fluctuations in the flow field driven by interactions between the flame front and the recirculation vortex. Two soot modeling approaches are evaluated, differing in their treatment of soot model quantities: the first approach employs on-the-fly computation of source terms (FGM-C), while the second uses fully pre-tabulated source terms (FGM-T). Their predictive performance and computational cost are compared in the context of unsteady, sooting flames in swirl-stabilized combustors.",

    "abstract": "Recently discovered ferroelectric nematic (NF) liquid crystals are fluids with a polar orientational order. The electric polarization vector can be aligned by an electric field and by surface anchoring. Here, we explore how the polarization field and effective viscosity of the NF materials are affected by shear flows. We explore three NF materials, abbreviated RM734, DIO, and a room-temperature FNLC919, all of which exhibit a paraelectric nematic (N) and the NF phase. All materials show an increase of the viscosity upon cooling, with an Arrhenius behavior. In DIO and FNLC919, the antiferroelectric SmZA phase shows a strong dependence of the effective viscosity on the shear rate: this viscosity is lower than the viscosity of the N and NF phases at high shear rates but is much higher when the shear rate is low. The behavior is associated with the layered structure of the SmZA phase. All mesophases exhibit shear-thinning behavior at low shear rates and a nearly Newtonian behavior at higher shear rates. In terms of alignment, we observe three regimes in the N and NF phases: flow-alignment at low shear rates, log-rolling regime with the director and polarization along the vorticity axis at high shear rates, and polydomain structures at intermediate rates. In the flow-aligning regime, the NF polarization does not tilt away from the shear direction, which is in sharp contrast to the flow-induced tilt of the N director. The effect is attributed to the avoidance of splay deformations and associated space charge in the flowing NF. The temperature and shear rate dependencies of the viscosity and the uncovered shear-induced structural effects of NF advance our understanding of these materials and potentially facilitate their applications.",

A MFEL is characterized by a radially symmetric, spatially varying refractive index with the remarkable property that rays emitted from any point within the lens are perfectly focused at their image points. While the implementation of such gradient-index lenses is challenging in conventional optical systems, BECs offer a highly tunable platform in which the spatially varying speed of sound of collective excitations -- phonons, the acoustic-wave analogues of photons -- can be engineered and their dynamics observed in real time. Time-resolved measurements of phonon wavefronts reveal focusing behavior that shows good agreement with analytical theory and numerical simulations. This work provides both a geometric and physical framework for engineering effective refractive indices using ultracold atoms, and simulating wave propagation on effective spherical geometries.",

Domain boundaries are discretized using triangular meshes, upon which the electric and magnetic surface current densities are expanded using the Rao-Wilton-Glisson (RWG) basis functions. For periodic structures, such as photonic crystals and metasurfaces, HELIOS employs Ewald's transformation to efficiently evaluate the infinite series associated with 2D lattices. Regarding stratified media, the code utilizes a matrix-friendly approach for the layered media Green's tensor, computing Sommerfeld integrals and accelerating calculations through a tabulation-interpolation scheme. The source code is implemented in C++, while a Python interface manages the workflow, including simulation setup, solver run, and post-processing. The accuracy and versatility of HELIOS are demonstrated through various examples that cover all its functionalities.",

    "abstract": "Single-crystal X-ray diffraction and nonlinear optical measurements, especially second- and third-harmonic generation (SHG/THG) are comprehensively investigated for the van der Waals layered material AgScP2S6 with a non-centrosymmetric P31c (159) space group. Linear optical constants are extracted using spectroscopic ellipsometry and applied in fitting the harmonic generation behavior. Polarization-resolved SHG and THG measurements exhibit pronounced anisotropy, with emission patterns well-described by theoretical models derived from the khi(2) and khi(3) tensor elements. The material demonstrates exceptionally high nonlinear susceptibilities, with khi(2) ~ 10^(-8) m/V and khi(3) ~ 10^(-17) m^2/V^2 which is a few orders of magnitude greater than comparable 2D materials reported in the literature. Temperature-dependent SHG and THG measurements from 300 K to 25 K reveal exponential decay in harmonic signal intensities, attributed to reduced carrier mobility, with no evidence of structural phase transitions, consistent with results from single crystal diffraction and heat capacity measurements. Polarization-resolved SHG and THG measurements also reveal distinct orientation and ellipticity trends, highlighting the anisotropic nonlinear tensor contributions and contrasting polarization selection rules in the material. These results establish AgScP2S6 as a high-performance, thermally stable, and highly anisotropic nonlinear candidate material suitable for compact photonic applications such as ultrafast optical modulators, polarization-sensitive detectors, and wavelength-tunable light sources.",

    "abstract": "We present the first statistical study of geomagnetic storm forecasting using in situ data from the STEREO-A spacecraft as a sub-L1 monitor. Between November 2022 and June 2024, STEREO-A crossed the Sun-Earth line, covering longitudinal and radial separations of +/-15° from the Sun-Earth line and 0.01-0.06 au from Earth. This passage provides a unique opportunity to assess future sub-L1 mission concepts by ESA, such as HENON and SHIELD. We identify 32 coronal mass ejections (CMEs) observed by both STEREO-A and L1 spacecraft. Eight of these 32 CME events are first detected at L1, indicating that radial spacecraft separations of up to ~0.05 au do not always yield lead time advantages. Furthermore, we find greater (smaller) gains in lead time when STEREO-A is east (west) of the Sun-Earth line. We develop a baseline methodology for the use of future sub-L1 in situ data to enable time-shifting and real-time modeling of the geomagnetic SYM-H index. This is run continuously over the entire time period, therefore modeling the geomagnetic response of all solar wind structures. Our methodology is empirically motivated and should be considered a first approach in addressing the use of sub-L1 data. Following this methodology, 26 of 47 observed geomagnetic storms are correctly identified from STEREO-A data. Intense events (82%, SYM-H<-100 nT) are well detected, most of which are also associated with an identified CME event. Most SYM-H minima are predicted later (72%) and stronger (58%) than those observed due to biases introduced by our methodology.",

    "abstract": "One of the primary objectives of modern astronomy is the atmospheric characterization of Earth-like exoplanets at visible and infrared wavelengths. Achieving this goal requires extremely sensitive detectors capable of measuring faint signal of the exoplanet at the single-photon level while maintaining near-zero dark count rates. In the infrared, however, conventional semiconducting detector technologies struggle to meet these stringent requirements. In this work we demonstrate single-photon counting with superconducting Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors at the wavelengths 3.8, 8.5, 18.5, and 25 $μ$m and measure resolving powers ($E/δE$) of 9.9, 5.9, 3.2, and 3.3, respectively, with corresponding dark count rates of 4, 8, 34, and 48 mHz. Our membrane-based devices reach phonon-loss limited performance at 3.8 $μ$m, more than doubling the performance attainable with comparable solid-substrate devices. These results showcase the detector technology in the mid-infrared and the intricate measurement setup required for these sensitive detectors. We discuss how the detector design and measurement setup can be further optimized to increase the detector performance in the mid-infrared.",

    "abstract": "The present study investigates photochromic oxygen-containing yttrium hydride (YHO) thin films deposited by reactive high power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS) and compares their photochromic, optical, and structural properties with those of films synthesized by reactive pulsed direct current magnetron sputtering (pulsed-DCMS). Optical emission spectroscopy reveals that, unlike pulsed-DCMS where Ar$^{+}$ ions dominate, HiPIMS discharges are characterised by strong Y$^{+}$ emission, evidencing high yttrium ionisation and substantial self-sputter recycling. The critical working pressure (P$_c$) required to obtain transparent and photochromic films is higher for HiPIMS (Pc $\\approx$ 1.0 Pa) than for pulsed-DCMS (Pc $\\approx$ 0.5 Pa). Although films deposited near Pc exhibit similar solar transmittance (~72 %) and lattice parameters (5.38--5.39 Å), the pulsed-DCMS film shows a substantially higher relative photochromic contrast (34 %) and a lower optical band gap (2.70 eV) compared with the HiPIMS film (9 % contrast and 2.94 eV). This difference is partly attributed to a lower oxygen-to-hydrogen atomic ratio in the pulsed-DCMS film. Structurally, HiPIMS films are largely polycrystalline with random out-of-plane crystallographic orientation, whereas pulsed-DCMS films exhibit a pronounced <100> out-of-plane preferred orientation. These results demonstrate that, beyond composition, thin-film growth conditions and microstructure play a crucial role in governing the photochromic performance of YHO.",

    "abstract": "Atomistic simulations of electrochemical interfaces remain challenging due to the long time scales required to adequately sample the structure of the electric double layer. The emergence of efficient, short-range machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) offers a promising alternative to computationally expensive density functional theory-based molecular dynamics (DFT-MD) simulations in this regard. However, in standard periodic DFT calculations of metal surfaces, the surface charge is implicitly set by the number of counterions in the simulation cell, making it a global property that is difficult to represent with strictly local MLIPs. Here, we benchmark common MLIP architectures (DP, ACE, MACE) for charged Au/water interfaces containing solvated sodium ions. We find that MLIPs trained on datasets spanning multiple surface charge states yield inconsistent predictions of interfacial water orientation and ion distributions, although message-passing models with a larger receptive field exhibit greater robustness to training on mixed-charge datasets. In contrast, models trained on a single charge state produce consistent equilibrium interfacial properties. Finally, we assess the performance of the eSEN model trained on the recently released Open Catalyst 2025 dataset, which includes solid/liquid interfaces that span a wide range of surface charge densities. Overall, our results characterize the limitations of short-range MLIPs for simulations of electrochemical interfaces and provide practical guidance for constructing training datasets for simulations of charged metal/electrolyte interfaces.",

    "title": "A fusion of concepts",
    "abstract": "This essay fuses concepts and approaches used to describe fluctuating phenomena in climate systems and statistical mechanics, and explores new ideas essential for understanding such phenomena. Its starting points are the Langevin equation (LE) and the fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT). The former was introduced to climate research by Klaus Hasselmann through his stochastic climate models. While a version of the latter, formulated within the framework of linear response theory, has found wide application, the deeper origin of the relation between fluctuations and dissipation has remained inconclusive. This essay goes one step further by seeking the cause of the apparent randomness, rather than merely describing it as in the LE, and by directly linking a fluctuation-dissipation relation to the governing microscopic equations. It postulates that such a relation, also referred to as the integral fluctuation-dissipation relation (IFDR), resides in integrals of the forcings that determine microscopic evolutions (individual trajectories) of the considered system. The IFDR ensures the emergence of well-defined macroscopic quantities, such as variance and spectra, quantities that characterize the system's fluctuations, provided the system is in dynamical equilibrium with constant external forcing. It is the dissipation embodied in IFDR that renders future states uncorrelated with initial conditions, thereby generating apparent randomness. Randomness is therefore not an unphysical artifact; on the contrary, it is a fundamental property of forced-dissipative systems in dynamical equilibrium. Fluctuation phenomena in such systems must be described by two principles: the governing microscopic equations and the IFDR. The two principles are complementary but not reducible to one another.",

Since light r-process elements shape the early ($\\sim$0.5-1.5$\\mathrm{d}$) ejecta opacity, a detailed study of the selenium element with a focus on atomic data calculation, expansion opacity estimation and spectral analysis is presented. Se atomic data are calculated from Se I to Se X using the GRASP2018 code. A systematic analysis and evaluation of their precision is performed through detailed comparison with the NIST ASD, and other works available in the literature. These atomic data are then used to estimate expansion opacity at different temperatures (e.g., T=5000 K, 10000 K, 20000 K, 100000 K) and densities (e.g., $ρ= 10^{-13}\\,\\mathrm{g\\,cm^{-3}},\\,3\\times10^{-12}\\,\\mathrm{g\\,cm^{-3}}$). Spectral analysis has been performed with radiative transfer code POSSIS with a pre-computed opacity grid calculated with new densities and temperatures, ranging from -19.5 to -4.5 $\\mathrm{g\\,cm^{-3}}$ in log-scale and from 1 000 to 51 000 K, respectively. Two scenarios are considered: one in which the opacity contribution comes from 100\\% Se ejecta, and another in which Se contributes only partially to the total opacity ($\\sim$ 10\\% of the total mass). Se atomic calculations show a good agreement with NIST ASD, with accurate energy levels and transitions determined alongside atomic data for higher ionisation stages not fully covered by NIST. The expansion opacities calculated with these new Se data exhibit differences in comparison to existing literature works. Se spectral features can only be observed in the KN scenario consisting of 100\\% Se. When Se accounts for about 10\\% of the total KN mass, these features become undetectable.

    "abstract": "In this thesis, we assess the sensitivity of next-generation long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments, DUNE, T2HK, and T2HKK, to three popular beyond the Standard Model (BSM) scenarios. Within the three BSM studies, we examine: (i) long-range neutrino-matter interactions induced by flavor-dependent, anomaly-free gauged baryon-lepton symmetries mediated by ultra-light vector boson, showing that DUNE and T2HK can constrain, discover, and in some favorable cases distinguish among different symmetries; (ii) Lorentz invariance violation (LIV), where we derive analytical dependencies of CPT-conserving and CPT-violating LIV parameters on baseline and energy, highlighting the superior reach of DUNE in probing all the LIV parameters, in contrast to T2HK, which is essentially blind to the CPT-conserving LIV parameters; and (iii) active-sterile oscillations over a broad range of $Δm^2_{41}$, where we derive sensitivity to CP phases for benchmark choices of $Δm^2_{41}$ and establish exclusion limits, emphasizing the role of near detectors. Together, these studies show that future long-baseline facilities not only resolve the neutrino mass ordering, value of $δ_{\\rm CP}$, and $θ_{23}$ octant, but also provide powerful probes of BSM physics.",

    "abstract": "Measuring the phase of light is fundamental to optical imaging, sensing, and signal processing applications. Conventional optical phase measurements rely on multipath configurations, bulky interferometric setups, and computationally intensive data pipelines, limiting scalability, robustness, and practicality. We introduce a technique that allows for reference-free in-line phase retrieval of abrupt phase transitions in optical pulses directly from spectral measurements. Theory, simulations, and experiments concurrently explain the effect as a result of a Kerr-mediated interference between a projected linear wave component and the high-intensity residual of the phase-altered pulse. Utilizing this phenomenon, we demonstrate algorithm-free phase measurements of up to π/385 sensitivity and shot-to-shot signal prominence at 13 dB above noise at 80 MHz rates and 50 pJ pulse energies. This approach offers new paths toward the use of femtosecond pulses as broadband data carriers for optical communications, information processing, and direct high-throughput phase imaging.",

    "abstract": "Self-guided femtosecond laser pulses propagating in low-pressure gas can generate plasma filaments, establishing a new framework for plasma wakefield acceleration. Unlike conventional schemes relying on mechanically confined or preformed plasma channels, this method exploits the intrinsic non-linear light-matter interaction, greatly reducing the energy required to generate plasma. This, in turn, allows to realise tunable stages, potentially operating above kHz repetition rate and with meter-scale interaction lengths and transverse sizes down to a few tens of micrometres. Moreover, the laser-plasma filament reproducibility is intrinsically higher than state-of-the-art discharge-plasmas, where the breakdown process is initiated in a stochastic and uncontrolled manner. As a result, laser-based plasma formation offers improved reliability and control over plasma parameters. Here we report a proof-of-principle experimental demonstration of beam-driven wakefield acceleration of electron bunches with an accelerating field exceeding 250 MV/m in a laser-generated plasma filament. The results are cross-checked with numerical simulation, showing an excellent agreement and providing a complete picture of the physical process. Beyond particle acceleration, the concept bridges laser filamentation physics, advanced plasma photonics and compact accelerator technologies, offering a promising route towards sustainable, high-repetition-rate plasma-based facilities.",

    "abstract": "An experimental investigation of intracavity dispersion effects in a synchronously pumped optical parametric oscillator (SPOPO) is presented. A flexible setup combining spectral and phase shaping of both pump and local oscillator fields with frequency-resolved balanced homodyne detection is employed to examine how intracavity dispersion influences squeezing. Different cavity configurations with varying finesse and dispersion conditions are studied, and the squeezing is measured as a function of pump power and local oscillator bandwidth. Contrary to expectations based on existing theoretical models, the measured squeezing levels remain essentially unchanged as dispersion varies. To account for these observations, a modeling approach is introduced in which intracavity dispersion is described as an effective spectral filtering occurring at the stage of SPOPO supermode generation. Within this framework, the filtering is incorporated directly into the interaction Hamiltonian of the nonlinear process. This perspective establishes a consistent experimental benchmark for the study of dispersion in SPOPOs and underscores the importance of spectral filtering in the interpretation of multimode squeezing experiments.",

    "abstract": "Bohr's principle of complementarity, prohibiting simultaneous access to certain physical properties within a single experimental arrangement, is considered to be a defining feature of quantum mechanics. It is commonly viewed as inducing an intrinsic hierarchy among incompatible observables: some sets of quantum properties are fundamentally more incompatible than others, as quantified by the maximal sharpness permitting their joint measurement. We show that this hierarchy ceases to be absolute in the multi-copy regime. Analyzing qubit spin observables, we prove a No-Comparison Theorem establishing that no global ordering of incompatible observable sets is preserved across all finite-copy configurations. In particular, two sets of observables can exhibit reversed complementarity ordering depending solely on whether the available resources are arranged as identical copies or as parallel-antiparallel pairs. Thus, the degree of quantum incompatibility is not an intrinsic property of observables alone but depends on the global configuration of the prepared quantum probes. Our results uncover a configuration-dependent structure of complementarity, reveal a subtle role of entanglement in shaping the structure of measurement limitations, and call for a reassessment of quantum information protocols under finite resources.",

The electronic structure is described within a six-orbital tight-binding framework constructed from the relevant tungsten and selenium orbitals, with atomic spin-orbit coupling included explicitly. Periodic driving is incorporated via the Peierls substitution, and in the high-frequency limit the system is mapped onto an effective static Floquet Hamiltonian with polarization-dependent renormalized hoppings. Coherent transport is evaluated using wave-function matching within the Landauer-Büttiker formalism. The lattice thermal conductivity is obtained independently from density functional perturbation theory combined with an iterative solution of the phonon Boltzmann transport equation. Light-induced hopping renormalization reshapes the band dispersion and transmission spectrum near the Fermi level, modifying the Landauer transport integrals that determine electrical and thermal conductances and the Seebeck coefficient. Together with spin-orbit-driven band splitting and reduced lattice thermal conductivity from enhanced anharmonic scattering, this leads to a thermoelectric figure of merit $ZT$ exceeding unity over a broad temperature range.",

Starting from its reformulation as a regularized quadratic optimization, we develop a framework to tackle this problem using both classical and quantum-compatible methods. In particular, we derive a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) representation of the unfolding objective, allowing direct implementation on quantum annealing and hybrid quantum-classical solvers. The proposed approach is implemented in QUnfold, an open-source Python package integrating classical mixed-integer solvers and D-Wave's hybrid quantum solver. We benchmark the method against widely used unfolding techniques in RooUnfold, including response Matrix Inversion, Iterative Bayesian Unfolding, and Singular Value Decomposition unfolding, using synthetic dataset with controlled distortion effects. Our results demonstrate that the optimization-based approach achieves competitive reconstruction accuracy across multiple distributions while naturally accommodating regularization within the objective function. This work establishes a unified optimization perspective on unfolding and provides a practical pathway for exploring quantum-enhanced methods in experimental HEP data analysis.",

    "abstract": "This study experimentally, numerically, and theoretically investigates the cavity/bubble dynamics and radiated acoustics during the water entry of a centimeter-scale cylindrical projectile with a conical nose. Experiments were conducted in a laboratory tank, employing synchronized high-speed imaging and hydrophone measurements to characterize the cavity closure modes and their resultant acoustic signatures across a range of Froude numbers. The acoustic signal features a weak radiated signal upon impact, followed by significant pressure oscillations spanning more than 20 cycles in the flow field after cavity elongation and pinch-off. A numerical model based on the Finite Volume Method (FVM) successfully captures these physical processes. Subsequently, a semi-theoretical model that incorporates the projectile's boundary effect is developed from potential flow theory. The model not only yields a dominant cavity oscillation frequency that agrees well with experimental data, but also reveals that the boundary effect leads to a cavity oscillation frequency markedly higher than the Minnaert frequency of an equivalent-volume ellipsoidal bubble containing an internal rigid core. The dominant cavity frequency falls nearly linearly with Fr, governed by nose geometry and projectile inertia. This study clarifies the underlying physics connecting cavity dynamics during water entry to underwater acoustic radiation.",

    "abstract": "Quantum noise limits the sensitivity of optical measurements, but squeezed states of light enable quantum-enhanced metrology, sensing, and information processing. Most on-chip squeezed-light sources rely on Kerr ($χ^{(3)}$) nonlinearities, remain limited by pump power and excess loss constraints. Quadratic ($χ^{(2)}$) platforms instead provide stronger parametric interactions, lower pump power requirements, and greater spectral engineering flexibility. Here, we demonstrate strong, broadband squeezed-light generation on a thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) photonic chip using a dual-resonant optical parametric amplifier implemented in a single periodically poled LN (PPLN) microresonator. Near-full-depth domain inversion is achieved simultaneously with highly over-coupled resonances, exhibiting escape efficiencies exceeding 90% and intrinsic quality factors above 2.5 million in a 0.6 mm$^2$ X-cut TF-PPLN resonator, enabling efficient squeezing at 1587 nm when pumped at 793.5 nm. Operating in the continuous-wave regime, we directly measure -0.81 dB of squeezing below the shot-noise limit with a pump power of 27 mW, together with +4.29 dB of anti-squeezing. From these measurements, we infer an on-chip squeezing level of -7.52 dB $\\pm$ 0.22 dB (95% confidence interval: [-7.96,-7.10] dB), and an on-chip anti-squeezing level of +9.62 dB $\\pm$ 0.25 dB. We demonstrate single-mode squeezing at degeneracy with a squeezed-light spectrum exceeding 10.3 THz. This work reports the highest squeezing ratio among integrated $χ^{(2)}$ cavity platforms and the first quasi-phase matched, fully resonant $χ^{(2)}$ cavity squeezer on chip, establishing a scalable route to fully integrated power-efficient squeezed-light sources for quantum-enhanced sensing and metrology.",

It is newly found that combined effects of the collisional TEM stabilization by the isotope ions and the associated increase in the impacts of the steady zonal flows at the near-marginal linear stability lead to the significant transport reduction with the opposite ion mass dependence in comparison to the conventional gyro-Bohm scaling. The universal nature of the isotope effects on the TEM-driven turbulence and zonal flows is verified for a wide variety of toroidal plasmas, e.g., axisymmetric tokamak and non-axisymmetric helical/stellarator systems.",

Spectral analyses of the \"triad\" entropy transfer function introduced in this study reveal not only the nonlinear interactions among the zonal and non-zonal modes, but also their effects on the turbulent transport level. Different types of the entropy transfer processes between the ITG and ETG turbulence are found: The entropy transfer from non-zonal to zonal modes is substantial in the saturation phase of the ITG instability, while, once the strong zonal flow is generated, the entropy transfer to the zonal modes becomes quite weak in the steady turbulence state. Instead, the zonal flows mediate the entropy transfer from non-zonal modes with low radial-wavenumbers (with contribution to the heat flux) to the other non-zonal modes with higher radial-wavenumbers (but with less contribution to the heat flux) through the triad interaction. The successive entropy transfer processes to the higher radial-wavenumber modes are associated with transport regulation in the steady turbulence state. In contrast, in both the instability-saturation and steady phases of the ETG turbulence, the entropy transfer processes among low-wavenumber non-zonal modes are dominant rather than the transfer via zonal modes.",

    "title": "A Multi-Diagnostic Observational Framework for Magnetosonic Solitary Waves During Geomagnetic Storms in Solar Cycles 24 and 25 using Cluster II Mission",
    "abstract": "Solitary structures, commonly known as solitons, are a class of nonlinear plasma waves that are abundantly found in near-Earth plasmas and planetary magnetospheres. They are nonlinear, localized plasma waves that maintain their shape and velocity over time and distance. While their occurrence in various space plasma environments has been extensively reported, their observation during geomagnetic storms, large-scale disturbances driven by interactions between the solar wind and Earth's magnetosphere, remains limited. In this study, we present a comparative investigation of magnetosonic soliton signatures during geomagnetic storms associated with Solar Cycles 24 and 25. Using high-resolution in-situ magnetic field measurements from the Cluster II mission, we systematically examine the plasma conditions favorable for soliton generation and their evolution during storm-time dynamics. A comprehensive multi-diagnostic observational framework, incorporating several state-of-the-art analytical techniques, is developed to reliably detect and characterize magnetosonic solitons. The results demonstrate that solitary structures in both storms predominantly occur during the early storm intervals, prior to the main phase, suggesting that they may serve as potential precursor signatures of enhanced geomagnetic activity.",

    "abstract": "We explore with ab-initio theory high harmonic generation (HHG) from a series of gas-phase fullerenes (from C$_{20}$ to C$_{60}$, including isomers) under varying laser conditions (different ellipticities, angular orientations, intensities and wavelengths). We find that HHG emission from fullerenes exhibits a prominent high-energy second plateau, extending well above the expected semi-classical cutoff, e.g. for an 800 nm driving laser with a peak intensity of $10^{14}$ W/cm$^2$, the anomalous $2^{nd}$ plateau cutoff is 115 eV. We theoretically analyze the underlying $2^{nd}$ plateau physical mechanism and determine that: (i) It differs from the standard SFA-like mechanism; (ii) It is recombination- based; (iii) It has an unusual inverted cutoff scaling with wavelength (whereby the cutoff decreases with increasing wavelength, until reaching a saturation); and (iv) It exhibits a linear cutoff dependence with electric field amplitude E$_0$ . We further rule out real-space trajectory based pictures, indicating that the most likely culprits are sharp quantum mechanical resonances in the fullerene family. Our work establishes a new route for high energy coherent broadband emission without requiring mid-IR driving and uncovers a novel HHG mechanism in complex structure quantum systems.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a detailed description and characterization of a new open-source vehicle trajectory dataset, namely SWIFTraj, constructed from videos recorded by a swarm of 16 drones equipped with 5.4K-resolution cameras. The dataset is distinguished from existing open-source trajectory datasets in several aspects. First, it provides long-distance continuous trajectories of up to 4.5 km on a freeway, enabling in-depth investigation of traffic phenomena and their spatial and temporal evolution. Second, the data collection site covers an integrated network consisting of a long freeway corridor and parts of its connected urban network, facilitating traffic analysis and modeling from a network perspective. The potential applications of the dataset for transportation research, including traffic flow analysis, modeling, and control at multiple scales, as well as topics related to autonomous driving, are thoroughly discussed. Finally, SWIFTraj is released as a freely accessible open-source dataset to support and accelerate future research in the transportation community. The dataset is publicly available at the SWIFTraj website (https://www.swiftraj.com).",

    "abstract": "Large, 3D trapped ion crystals offer improved sensitivity in quantum sensing protocols, and are expected to be implemented as platforms in near-future experiments. However, numerical techniques used to study the laser cooling of such crystals are inefficient as the number of ions, $N$, in the crystal increases. Here we develop a powerful numerical framework to simulate laser cooling of up to $10^5$ ions stored in a Penning trap. We apply this framework to characterize and optimize the cooling of ellipsoidal 3D crystals. We document new pathways to enhanced cooling based on the addition of an axial component to the potential energy-dominated $\\boldsymbol{E}\\times\\boldsymbol{B}$ modes. Furthermore, we observe greatly enhanced cooling of the perpendicular kinetic energy to below 1 mK in prolate ion crystals, enabling a simplified cooling beam setup for such crystals. We propose specific values of trap and laser beam parameters which lead to optimal cooling in a variety of examples. This work illustrates the feasibility of preparing large 3D crystals for high-sensitivity quantum science protocols, motivating their use in future experiments.",

    "title": "Evaluating the resolution of AI-based accelerated MR reconstruction using a deep learning-based model observer",
    "abstract": "We developed a deep learning-based model observer (DLMO) to evaluate a multi-coil sensitivity encoding parallel MRI system at different accelerations on the Rayleigh discrimination task as a surrogate measure of resolution. We inserted Gaussian-convolved doublet and singlet signals into the white matter area of synthetic brain images. K-space raw data were acquired by using a simulated MR imaging system at acceleration factors of one (fully sampled), four and eight. These raw data were reconstructed using a conventional root-sum-of-squares (rSOS) method and an U-Net method. DLMOs were first trained with fully sampled images and then re-trained for each acceleration using a transfer learning approach. These DLMOs had a similar discrimination performance as trained human readers, using a human-label alignment training strategy. The resolution of rSOS- and U-Net-reconstructed images was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). We observed that the U-Net method yielded significantly higher PSNR and SSIM than rSOS across different accelerations. However, task-based evaluation using the proposed DLMO revealed that the U-Net underperformed relative to the fully sampled reconstruction (i.e. rSOS 1x). Although U-Net at an acceleration factor of four exhibited modest gains over rSOS at the same acceleration for short signals, its AUC decreased by approximately 25% and 5% for 4 mm and 5 mm signals, respectively, compared with rSOS 1x. Comparable declines in U-Net-obtained AUC relative to rSOS 1x were also observed at acceleration factor of eight. These results demonstrate that AI-based accelerated MR reconstruction may produce visually pleasing images but may not achieve performance comparable to that of rSOS 1x. The proposed DLMO approach may be employed to characterize the discriminative efficacy of AI-based undersampled reconstruction in MRI.",

    "abstract": "Photonic neuromorphic computing promises revolutionary advances in parallel and high-speed processing, yet a key challenge persists: co-integrating nonlinearity, dense connectivity, and intrinsic memory monolithically to enable brain-inspired, spatiotemporal information processing. Here, we overcome this challenge by introducing a monolithic photonic recurrent network based on an active metasurface operating at bound state in the continuum (BIC). The BIC mode mediates strong,long-range coupling across the lattice, creating a reconfigurable recurrent network topology in hardware. Concurrently, the gain medium provides both optical nonlinearity for neuronal activation and a finite carrier lifetime that serves as a built in, analog temporal memory. This synergy enables computation to emerge directly from the collective spatiotemporal dynamics of the driven-dissipative photonic system, effectively realizing a physical reservoir computer on a chip. We experimentally validate a minimal yet physically complete system on benchmark tasks: brain MRI image classification and human action recognition, achieving 92.16% and 85.36% accuracies, respectively. This work establishes a scalable pathway toward ultrafast, energy-efficient neuromorphic intelligence where processing is an inherent property of tailored light matter interaction.",

    "abstract": "Phase control of parametric modulation in coupled oscillator networks enables sculpting of dynamical states with desired spatiotemporal symmetries. Symmetry-aware Floquet analysis successfully predicts such states in linear systems, but whether their symmetry properties persist under nonlinearity remains largely unexplored. Here, we establish the existence of nonlinear chiral steady states in a trio of coupled parametric oscillators with modulation phases chosen to selectively amplify a circulating mode in the linearized system. We find that a cubic nonlinearity arrests exponential growth of the amplified mode, producing a steady finite-amplitude motion that retains the expected chirality. By exploiting space-time symmetry, we reduce the dynamics to a single averaged equation that quantitatively predicts nonlinear trajectories, steady-state amplitudes, and characteristic time scales. The chiral steady states possess finite basins of attraction and are accessible from wide ranges of initial conditions and system parameters. Finite-element simulations of elastic plate resonators quantitatively reproduce these features, establishing the relevance of the reduced model to realistic continuum systems. Our results demonstrate that desirable properties of linear time-modulated systems, such as chirality and directional amplification, persist into strongly nonlinear regimes, opening pathways to robust nonreciprocal signal routing and amplification in parametrically driven platforms.",

We demonstrate a compact, low cost stabilization method using a scanning Fabry Perot interferometer (SFPI) to transfer lock a 960nm coupler laser to an 852nm probe. The lock suppresses coupler multi MHz free running drift and improves the Allan deviation by up to an order of magnitude, reaching <75kHz at 66s. Applied to DTC oscillations using a Rb 2 photon D2 transition, the second harmonic generated 480nm (from 960nm lock) reduces DTC frequency drift from >20kHz to a few kHz and lowers instability by more than an order of magnitude with a minimum Allan deviation of 0.2kHz at <10s. These results establish SFPI-based transfer locking as a practical and accurate approach for scalable multi laser Rydberg experiments requiring long-term stability in a compact and low cost system.",

Testing at the ZEUS D--T Dense Plasma Focus established a reference calibration and agreement with a praseodymium-calibrated silver activation detector.

We validate the CID across systems of increasing complexity, beginning with single-component Lennard-Jones melting before examining binary phase separation, polymer condensation and dispersion, and assembly of amorphous carbon networks at multiple densities. Unlike conventional order parameters, CID requires no a priori knowledge of relevant structural features and captures entropic signatures across a variety of molecular systems and discretization resolutions.

    "title": "Anomalous cosmic rays within the inner heliosphere: Observations of helium by the High Energy Telescope onboard Solar Orbiter",
    "abstract": "Radial gradients of cosmic rays are key parameters for understanding the transport of particles in space. Solar Orbiter, launched on 2020 February 10, approaches the Sun approximately every half year, with a closest perihelion distance of 0.29 au after the end of 2022 during the nominal mission phase. The two double-ended high energy telescopes(HET)onboard the Solar Orbiter measure energetic particles in the energy range between a few MeV/nuc and a few hundred MeV/nuc, which are dominated by anomalous cosmic rays (ACRs) and galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) during solar quiet times. By obtaining the radial gradient of the ACR helium in the inner heliosphere, we advance our understanding of how the transport of the cosmic rays is affected by the particle drift effect and the large-scale magnetic field. The helium observations at Solar Orbiter/HET between 11.1 and 49 MeV/nuc are analyzed. Since we focus on quiet time measurements, we remove the periods of solar energetic particle (SEP) events. The intensities are averaged over the Carrington rotation period. The helium observations from the Proton and Helium Instrument(EPHIN)onboard SOHO were utilized as the baseline to correct the long-term variation caused by the solar modulations. We present the first observation of ACR helium at Solar Orbiter/HET between 2020 February and 2022 July in the inner heliosphere before the sun became fully active. We derive the radial gradient of the ACR helium between 0.3 and 1 au. The averaged radial gradient between 11.1 and 49MeV/nuc is about 22$\\pm$4%/au and the averaged value between 11.1 and 41.2MeV/nuc is raised to 32$\\pm$8%/au after removing the GCR contribution, which is estimated by a GCR model. In addition, the temporal variation of radial gradients indicates that the gradients are increasing with the enhancement of the solar modulation and the increased tilt angle of the heliospheric current sheet.",

    "abstract": "Ultracold neutral plasmas provide a useful system for studying extreme parameter regimes plasma physics in an accessible laboratory setting. The parameter space of plasma physics can be characterized in part by coupling strength and degree of magnetization. The range of achievable strong coupling is determined in part by the lowest possible temperatures that can be achieved. This work examines the early-lifetime electron heating of moderately coupled, strongly magnetized plasmas. This heating is dominated by disorder-induced heating and heating due to Rydberg atom formation. By using experimentally informed simulations, it is found that disorder-induced heating has a large influence in electron temperature well into the plasma lifetime. Additionally, the dependence of the minimum achievable electron temperature on magnetization and initial electron energy is examined. In this work, we find electron temperatures as low as $0.52^{+.10}_{-.05}\\ \\mathrm{K}$ (for electron density, $n_{e}$, of $6.1 \\times 10^{12}\\ \\mathrm{m^{-3}}$), which determines the maximum coupling strength for the measured experimental conditions.",

However, achieving programmable, reversible, and spatiotemporal modulation of surface texture remains a fundamental challenge. Here, we present a photothermal-actuated liquid crystal elastomer bilayer that enables reversible, on-demand spatiotemporal modulation of surface textures through dynamically emerging and propagating wrinkles. Using direct laser writing or projected light fields, programmable and self-erasable wrinkle patterns are generated for dynamic information encoding. This spatiotemporal wrinkling enables object manipulation across diverse geometries, including uphill transport and navigation along predesigned paths. By coupling wrinkle-driven motion with thermally reversible dynamic bonding, the bilayer further enables assembly and disassembly of dynamic polymers, as well as cargo transportation. This work demonstrates spatiotemporally programmable wrinkling as a powerful mechanism for dynamic modulation of surface textures, establishing a versatile platform for multifunctional and reconfigurable smart surfaces.",

    "title": "Robustness-Runtime Tradeoff for Quantum State Transfer",
    "abstract": "Quantum state transfer is the primitive of transporting an unknown state on one site of a lattice to another. Using power-law interactions, recent state transfer protocols achieve speedup by utilizing the intermediate ancilla sites. However, these protocols require the ancillas to be in a perfectly initialized state, which, due to noise or imperfect control, may not be the case. In this work we introduce the $\\textit{robustness}$ of a state transfer protocol, which quantifies the protocol's tolerance to error in the initial ancilla state. In the Heisenberg picture, state transfer grows operators supported on the final site such that they no longer commute with all operators on the starting site. We prove that this robustness tightly bounds the Schatten $p$-norms of these commutators between initial and final-site operators. This generalizes the known cases of $p=\\infty$ and $p=2$, which govern completely state-dependent and state-independent state transfer respectively, demonstrating that intermediate values of $p$ govern partially state-dependent state transfer. In conjunction with existing power-law light cones, our result gives new minimum runtimes for partially state-dependent protocols which, in certain regimes, are parametrically better than existing bounds. We introduce new robust state transfer protocols, charting the landscape between complete state-dependence and state-independence.",

    "abstract": "We assess runaway-electron (RE) generation in ITER disruptions mitigated by shattered pellet injection (SPI) using improved physics modelling in the 1D disruption simulation framework Dream. To this end, we extend Dream with four ITER-relevant physics models: (i) a reduced model for RE scrape- off associated with the vertical plasma motion, (ii) a semi-analytical plasmoid- drift model for material deposition, (iii) an adaptive hyper-resistive transport model to suppress unphysical thin-current channels during the current quench (CQ), and (iv) an updated Compton RE generation seed calculated for the new ITER tungsten first-wall design. We simulate full-current 15 MA L-mode (H26, non-nuclear) and H-mode (DTHmode24, nuclear) scenarios, and an intermediate- current 7.5 MA H-mode non-nuclear case, from realistic ITER inputs. Complete avoidance of a multi-MA RE beam is found to require a long pre-thermal quench (TQ) duration to thermalize the hot-tail electrons, high deuterium assimilation with limited neon, and a representative seed current comparable to a single RE in ITER. As previously found with lower fidelity setups [Vallhagen et al, Nucl. Fusion 64 (2024)], these conditions are met by staggered or low-Ne injections in H26, but are typically violated in DT H-mode when nuclear seeds are present. In addition to analyzing the effect of the new models, we investigate the role of the current spike associated with the TQ and importance of radial transport of runaways in the CQ. After incorporating these additional physical effects into a comprehensive disruption model and analyzing their impact, we present a representative ITER DT H-mode SPI scenario which provides a theoretically viable route to tolerable RE currents in ITER fusion power operation.",

    "abstract": "Laser wakefield acceleration (LWFA) can produce relativistic electron beams and various secondary particles in centimeter-long plasmas, making it a valuable particle source with important applications in many disciplines. In this work, we examine the effects of non-ideal transverse intensity and phase distribution of laser pulses on LWFA through both experimental measurements and particle-in-cell simulations. The complex transverse profile of the 75 TW laser pulses reduces the self-focused intensity in plasma compared with a transversely Gaussian laser. Furthermore, the sheath structure of the nonlinear plasma wake excited by realistic laser pulses is wider and more complicated than that of a Gaussian laser. These hinder the injection of the plasma electrons. As the laser pulse propagates through the plasma, its intensity profile gradually becomes elliptical and drives a plasma wake with a sharp sheath near the azimuths of the major axis, leading to an injection. When using a realistic laser profile in simulations, both the charge and energy of injected electrons closely match experimental results ($\\sim200$ pC of charge and $\\sim 200$ MeV peak energy), whereas the Gaussian laser simulations produce much higher charge ($\\sim500$ pC). Our findings reveal the difference in injection dynamics between LWFA driven by non-ideal laser pulses and those driven by Gaussian pulses, and are useful for applications of LWFA which demand high-charge electron beams.",

    "abstract": "The large-scale dynamics of most conventional space and astrophysical plasmas are predominantly governed by Alfvén modes, which are low-frequency magnetohydrodynamic modes existing in magnetized media. At scales smaller than the ion gyroscale or frequencies exceeding the ion cyclotron frequency, the Alfvén modes transform into kinetic-Alfvén or whistler modes that significantly contribute to plasma dynamics. However, this scenario reverses in non-neutral pair plasmas, such as those found in the magnetospheres of pulsars and magnetars, around rotating black holes and in their relativistic jets, as well as in certain laboratory plasmas. In these systems, the large-scale dynamics is governed by hybrid whistler-Alfvén modes, which transform into pure Alfvén modes at smaller scales. We derive the nonlinear equations that describe the dynamics of whistler-Alfvén modes in ultrarelativistic non-neutral magnetically dominated pair plasma and discuss the spectrum of turbulence governed by these equations.",

    "abstract": "The effects of pressure on the crystal structure of scheelite-type perrhenates were studied using synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction and density-functional theory. At ambient conditions, the studied materials AgReO4, KReO4, and RbReO4, exhibit a tetragonal scheelite-type crystal structure described by space group I41/a. Under compression, a transition from scheelite-to-M${\\prime}$-fergusonite (space group P21/c) was observed at 1.6 and 7.4 GPa for RbReO4 and KReO4, respectively. The transition involves a relative volume decrease. On the other hand, AgReO4 underwent a phase transition to the M-fergusonite structure (space group I2/a) at 13.6 GPa. In this case there is no appreciable volume discontinuity. The room-temperature pressure-volume equation of state for the three studied perrhenates was estimated using a second-order Birch-Murnaghan equation of state. The results for the low-pressure phase are confirmed by density-functional theory calculations. The analysis of the bulk modulus shows that the compressibility of the compounds decreases following the sequence RbReO4 > KReO4 > AgReO4, which is related to the compressibility of the RbO8, KO8, and AgO8 bidisphenoid units. Density-functional theory also offers valuable insights into the elastic constants. Despite giving a good description for the low-pressure phase in the three compounds, density-functional theory cannot catch the structural phase transition observed in experiments. Reasons for it are discussed in the manuscript.",

    "abstract": "Programmable microheater arrays are essential for a variety of applications including gas sensing, microfluidic lab on a chip devices, 3D printers, and biosensors that rely on DNA amplification. Increasing the density and number of heating elements directly correlates with the precision with which spatiotemporal heat profiles can be delivered. However, large arrays have thus far not been realized. One challenge is that as the number of elements in an array increases, the complexity of connecting them grows. Here, we show that row-column addressing provides a promising architecture for the efficient operation of a large micro-heater array. We introduce a programmable 32 x 32 microheater array consisting of individually addressable robust platinum (Pt)-based Joule heating elements- each smaller than 300 micrometer. We show that combining high-voltage multiplexed electronics and sequential addressing controlled by a high frequency clock, allows the independent operation of the 1024 microheater elements. We demonstrate the generation of heat images and the patterning of metallic structures formed from the liquid metal Gallium. Our work demonstrates new capabilities for on-chip thermal devices, and opens the possibility to realize novel heat-controlled microactuation systems.",

    "abstract": "Photoionization is a key step in many attosecond processes. Accurately determining the photoionization time delay is critical to understanding electron dynamics during and after ionization and can guide future efforts to manipulate electron motion. Prior studies have shown that the photoionization time delay is non-zero and that pulse shaping through alteration of the spectral phase may change the number and timing of ionization events. In order to more quantitatively assess whether and how the spectral phase modifies the photoionization time delay, we use attosecond streaking simulations to extract the streaking time delay for ionizing pulses with identical power spectra, but different spectral phases. We compare streaking time delays for Gaussian, Airy, and fifth order phase extreme ultraviolet (XUV) pulses. We find that the streaking delay depends on the XUV spectral phase and that the sign of the delay is determined by the sign of the phase for large phases. Pulses with non-zero spectral phase show an asymmetry in the streaking spectrogram that is associated with phase-dependent spectral compression or broadening. Comparison of the streaking delays for short- and long-range potentials indicates that Coulomb-laser coupling contributions to the streaking shift are independent of spectral phase, confirming that the observed phase dependence arises from intrinsic photoionization dynamics. Overall, our work suggests that the spectral phase may open the door to new opportunities for controlling ionization timing and provide new avenues for coherent control of ultrafast electron",

    "abstract": "Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) integrated with waveguide-coupled dielectric resonators are promising building blocks for compact on-chip light sources. However, deterministic placement of QDs with strong mode overlap at the desired location remains a challenge. Here, we demonstrate a simple and scalable strategy for integrating colloidal QDs with a waveguide-coupled Si3N4 micro-ring resonator platform and for controlling the radiative dynamics of both bright and dark excitons via Purcell enhancement. We use strongly quantum-confined CsPbBr3 QDs, which exhibit bright-exciton emission at room-temperature, while emission at cryogenic temperatures originates from both bright and dark excitons. The CsPbBr3 QDs are selectively retained on the Si3N4 micro-ring cavities through a spin-coating/rinsing process, enabling efficient overlap with whispering-gallery modes and routing of the emission through integrated waveguides. We confirm accelerated decay of emission from both bright and dark excitons for CsPbBr3 QDs coupled to the micro-ring cavities. These results demonstrate an effective route to integrate colloidal QDs with Si3N4 micro-ring cavities and to leverage cavity-enhanced emission in scalable integrated photonic devices.",

    "abstract": "Collisions between electrons and radiating atoms broaden spectral absorption and emission lines in dense plasmas. High densities also introduce screening and pressure ionization effects that distort the wavefunctions of both bound and free electrons. In order to study how dense plasma effects influence the electron broadening of spectral lines, this paper incorporates electron wavefunctions from an average-atom (AA) model to calculate the line width of the B III $2p-2s$ transition at $T = 10$ eV for mass densities ranging from $ρ=10^{-4}-0.4$ g/cc. The calculation method uses the impact approximation, allowing the line width to be written in terms of electron-collision cross sections and an interference term. Compared to an otherwise identical calculation that uses Coulomb free wavefunctions, the AA method is found to modify both the cross sections and the resulting line width at sufficiently high density by introducing screening and pressure ionized bound states. Screening lowers the cross sections at low energies and near electron excitation thresholds, while pressure ionized bound states introduce resonances into the continuum. Thus, as the density increases, the relative line width between the AA and Coulomb calculations follows a general decrease because of screening, with sharp increases at various intervals due to pressure ionization. The AA results are also compared with a common approach to introduce screening through the interaction potential and reduced models that use the Bethe formula for the inelastic electron-collision cross sections.",

    "abstract": "Dense suspensions of self-propelled bacteria and related active fluids exhibit spontaneous flow generation, vortex formation, and spatiotemporally chaotic dynamics despite operating at vanishingly small Reynolds numbers. These phenomena, commonly referred to as active turbulence, display striking visual and statistical similarities to classical inertial turbulence while arising from fundamentally different nonequilibrium mechanisms. In this article, we present a combined review and theoretical study of hydrodynamic models for dense active fluids, with particular emphasis on bacterial suspensions described by the Toner--Tu--Swift--Hohenberg (TTSH) framework. We review key experimental and theoretical developments underlying the analogy between active and inertial turbulence, highlighting the emergence of multiple dynamical regimes and the conditions under which universal spectral and intermittent behavior arises in homogeneous systems. Moving beyond the conventional assumption of spatially uniform activity, we introduce a minimal model in which the activity field is heterogeneous and dynamically advected by the flow it generates. Thus treating activity as a spatiotemporally evolving field coupled to the TTSH dynamics, we investigate how advection and diffusion lead to sharp activity fronts, confinement of turbulent motion, and complex interfacial morphologies. Our numerical results demonstrate that spatial variations in activity can induce transient coexistence of distinct spectral regimes and that universality in active turbulence is inherently local and time-dependent in heterogeneous systems. These findings underscore the importance of treating activity as a dynamical field in its own right and provide a framework for studying active turbulence in more realistic, spatially structured biological and synthetic active matter systems.",

    "abstract": "Collective patterns of motion emerge across biological taxa: insects swarm, fish school, and birds flock. In particular, large migratory birds form strikingly ordered V-shaped formations, which experiments and direct numerical simulations have demonstrated provide substantial energetic benefits during long-distance flight. However, the precise aerodynamic and morphological mechanisms underlying these benefits remain unclear. In this work, we develop a reduced-order model of the wake-vortex interactions between two flapping birds flying in tandem. The model retains essential unsteady flapping dynamics while remaining computationally tractable. By optimizing over a six-dimensional state space, which comprises the follower's three-dimensional relative position and three independent flapping parameters, we identify the energetically optimal leader-follower configuration of northern bald ibises. The predicted optimum agrees quantitatively with live-bird measurements. Because of its simplicity, the model allows for direct interrogation of the physical mechanisms responsible for this optimum. In particular, it isolates precisely how the follower's wing kinematics interact with the leader's wake to enhance aerodynamic efficiency. The model predicts an 11% reduction in total mechanical power for a follower in formation flight -- consistent with experimental estimates -- and shows that this saving arises from reductions in both induced and profile power, dominated by decreased profile power enabled primarily through reduced flapping amplitude and, secondarily, reduced upstroke flexion. These results provide a mechanistic explanation for the structure of V-formations and offer new insight into the aerodynamic principles governing collective flight.",

We report three key results. First, authors who begin with loosely connected networks and progressively tighten their networks while expanding network size during mid-career achieve the highest PI attainment rates, publication output, and citation impact. Second, despite different starting points, network evolution patterns associated with better outcomes converge toward moderate clustering by career year 15, suggesting an optimal balance between core team cohesion and diverse external connections. Third, mobility is positively associated with these successful network evolution patterns and remains positively associated with scientific outcomes even after controlling for network evolution patterns.",

    "abstract": "Capacity drop is a traffic phenomenon in which the discharge flow from a queue is lower than the theoretical infrastructure capacity. This paper proposes a generic analytical method to estimate the queue discharge flow of freeway traffic. Capacity drop is primarily attributed to hesitant vehicles, defined as vehicles that stochastically and temporarily enter an acceleration delay state and generate voids (i.e., extra gaps) in front of them. The proposed method estimates the expected total void length generated by all hesitant vehicles, based on the distributions of their spatial and temporal locations as well as the associated delays. It also accounts for interactions between the waves triggered by downstream hesitant vehicles and the voids generated by upstream ones. Our analysis reveals that this interaction is the key mechanism behind the differing extents of capacity drop observed between standing queues and jam waves in previous studies. The accuracy of the model is validated through both numerical simulations and real-world trajectories. Overall, the proposed method offers a deeper understanding of capacity drop, which can be leveraged in traffic flow modeling and control.",

Turbulent thermal diffusion causes a non-diffusive contribution to turbulent flux of particles described in terms of an effective pumping velocity directed opposite to the gradient of the mean fluid temperature. For inertial particles, this effective pumping velocity depends on the Stokes and Reynolds numbers. In the experiments, fluid velocity and spatial distribution of inertial particles are measured using Particle Image Velocimetry system, and the temperature field is measured in many locations by a temperature probe equipped with 12 thermocouples. Measurements of temperature and particle number density spatial distributions have demonstrated formation of large-scale clusters of inertial particles in the vicinity of the mean temperature minimum due to turbulent thermal diffusion. In the experiments, the effective pumping velocity resulting in formation of large-scale clusters of inertial particles (having the diameter $10 μm$) is in 2.5 times larger than that for non-inertial particles (having the diameter $0.7 μm$). This is in an agreement with the theoretical predictions.",

However, their polarization behavior remains a critical factor affecting performance, as the emission state can switch between orthogonally polarized modes around the so-called polarization switching point. This regime exhibits high sensitivity, where small perturbations induce abrupt polarization changes and nonlinear responses. In this work, the polarization dynamics of VCSELs under sinusoidal current modulation around the switching point are numerically investigated using the Spin-Flip Model. The study examines the influence of modulation frequency, amplitude, and bias current, revealing distinct dynamical regimes including polarization locking, periodic and irregular switching. The observed transitions between regimes elucidate the interplay between modulation and polarization stability, providing insight into the control of VCSEL dynamics for high-speed optical communication and sensing applications.",

Coupling is via the Doppler shift in the dispersion relation governing action transport, and wave pseudomomentum in the Craik--Leibovich system. The velocity in the Doppler shift is a vertical integral of the Lagrangian mean velocity of the currents, with a weight that is consistent with the vertical structure of the pseudomomentum. This consistency ensures conservation of momentum and energy in the coupled wave--current system.   The conservation properties of the wave--current model stem from an underlying variational structure. We derive this structure from that of the rotating Euler equations for an incompressible fluid with free surface by introducing a Lagrangian wave--mean decomposition, making simplifying approximations, and Whitham averaging.   We apply the wave--current model to the problem of generation of inertial oscillations by surface waves originally considered by Hasselmann.",

Most notably, due to counter-propagation of light occurring in FP resonators, we unveil a collective polarization conformity effect, whereby multiple CSs circulating in the cavity converge to the same asymmetric polarization state once their number exceeds a certain threshold.

    "abstract": "This work extends the front propagation formulation (FPF) combustion model to large eddy simulation (LES) of swirl-stabilized turbulent premixed flames and investigates the effects of resolved flame thickness on the predicted flame dynamics. The FPF method is designed to mitigate the spurious propagation of under-resolved flames while preserving the reaction characteristics of filtered flame fronts. In this study, the model is extended to account for non-adiabatic effects and is coupled with an improved sub-filter flame speed estimation that resolves the inconsistency arising from heat-release effects on local sub-filter turbulence. The performance of the extended FPF method is validated by LES of the TECFLAM swirl-stabilized burner, where the results agree well with experimental measurements. The simulations reveal that the stretching of vortical structures in the outer shear layer leads to the formation of trapped flame pockets, which are identified as the physical mechanism responsible for the secondary temperature peaks observed in the experiment. The prediction of this phenomenon is shown to be strongly dependent on the resolved flame thickness, when the filter size is used for modeling sub-filter flame wrinklings. Without proper modeling of the chemical steepening effects, the thickness of the resolved flame brush is over-predicted, causing the flame consumption rate to be under-estimated. Consequently, the flame brush detaches from the outer shear layer, resulting in a failure to capture the flame pockets and the associated secondary temperature peaks.",

    "abstract": "Qudits, or multi-level quantum information carriers, present a promising path for scaling quantum computers. However, their use introduces increased complexity in quantum logic, necessitating careful control of relative phases between different qudit levels. In trapped-ion systems, entangling operations accumulate phases on specific levels that are no longer global, unlike in qubit architectures. Furthermore, the structure of multi-level gates becomes increasingly intricate with higher-dimensional Hilbert spaces. This work explores the theory of these additional entangling and non-entangling phases, accumulated in Mølmer--Sørensen and Light-shift gates. We propose methods to actively compensate for these phases, enhance gate robustness against parameter fluctuations, and simplify native gates for more efficient circuit decomposition. Our results pave the way toward the practical and scalable implementation of qudit-based quantum processors.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the influence of the Prandtl number ($Pr$) on penetrative internally heated convection (IHC) in both non-rotating and rotating regimes using three-dimensional direct numerical simulations. By varying $Pr$ between 0.1 and 100, we show that the global mean temperature $\\langle \\overline{T} \\rangle$ is not very sensitive to $Pr$, and is primarily controlled by the dynamics of the unstably stratified top boundary layer. In contrast, the Prandtl number dictates the behavior of the lower, stably stratified region and affects the vertical convective heat flux $\\langle \\overline{wT} \\rangle$. In the non-rotating case, low $Pr$ fluids exhibit a ``symmetry recovery'' where turbulent stirring agitates the stable layer, whereas high $Pr$ fluids transition toward a ``dead zone'' of suppressed fluctuations. Under rotation, we find that $\\langle \\overline{wT} \\rangle$ is enhanced across all Prandtl numbers, though global cooling efficiency, measured by the reduction in $\\langle \\overline{T} \\rangle$, is only improved for $Pr\\ge1$ due to the emergence of Ekman pumping. These results demonstrate that while IHC shares some scaling similarities with Rayleigh-Bénard convection at the top boundary, the internal stratification creates a unique sensitivity to $Pr$ that is critical for understanding heat transport in planetary and stellar interiors.",

Due to the feedback, the dynamics of the parametric resonator becomes more complex and a Hopf bifurcation at the instability threshold can occur. Initially, we calculate the phase-dependent gain of parametric amplification with feedback of an added ac signal. In one approach, we obtain the amplification gain approximately using two independent approaches: the averaging method and the harmonic balance method. We also obtain this gain more exactly using Floquet theory and Green's functions methods. The Hopf bifurcation was predicted by the harmonic balance method and by Floquet theory, but not by the averaging method. In our analysis of fluctuations, we Fourier analyze the response of the parametric resonator with feedback to an added white noise. We were able to calculate, in addition to the noise spectral density, the squeezing of fluctuations in this resonator with feedback. Very strong squeezing or cooling can occur. Deamplification and cooling occur near the Hopf bifurcation, whereas squeezing occurs near a saddle-node bifurcation.",

Both full and partial triples correction schemes are implemented using the exact two-component atomic mean-field (X2CAMF) Hamiltonian in combination with Cholesky-Decomposition (CD) of two-electron integrals and a frozen natural spinor (FNS) truncation scheme to reduce computational cost. Benchmark calculations on halide anions, noble gas atoms, hydrogen halides, and dihalogen molecules demonstrate that triple excitations are essential for achieving quantitative ionization potentials, reducing mean absolute errors to approximately 0.01--0.08~eV relative to reference and experimental values. The X2CAMF approximation reproduces four-component Dirac-Coulomb results with negligible deviations, while the CD-FNS strategy yields substantial reductions in wall time. The resulting partial triples correction scheme scales as non-iterative $\\mathcal{O}(n^7)$ with storage comparable to CCSD, offering an accurate and practical route for relativistic ionization energy calculations in heavy-element systems.",

Certain lattice geometries exhibit dispersionless flat bands, characterized by vanishing group velocity and diverging density of states, which present unique opportunities for applications such as slow light, nonlinear optical processes and controlling photoluminescence. However, thus far, flat bands have not been reported in systems where the lattice sites are radiatively coupled over a long range. Here we show that lattices consisting of superposed equispaced one dimensional chains exhibit flat bands with a purely diffractive origin, with the energies and angles of the flat bands controlled by the geometrical parameters of the lattice and the unit cell. The flat bands extend over all angles, can have linewidths on the order of a few nanometers, and are linearly polarized. We experimentally observe flat bands at predicted energies in lattices of gold nanoparticles at near-infrared frequencies using Fourier spectroscopy. Our results provide a general and efficient design strategy for lattices with flat, polarized dispersions for applications such as flat-band lasing, enhancing light-matter interaction, and controlling the emission or absorption of electromagnetic radiation over a wide spectral range.",

Suitably designed photonic structures give rise to flat (dispersionless) bands, where the density of states diverges, and group velocity goes to zero, allowing light localization. These properties make flat bands attractive for lasing; however, designing photonic structures supporting flat bands suitable for lasing is challenging. Here, we introduce nanoparticle chain lattices. These chain geometries provide long-range coupled systems that support, at predictable wavelengths, bands that are totally flat and extend over the full angular range. We demonstrate lasing in the transverse-magnetic (TM) mode of single chains of nanoparticles and explain the transition from flat band lasing to the single-mode normal-incidence (Gamma-point) lasing as the number of chains is increased. Moreover, we show partially coherent emission from square and triangular two-dimensional chain lattices. The excited modes depend on the pump power and polarization. Our results establish chain lattices as a versatile platform for exploring flat band lasing and suggest new routes toward narrowband, linearly polarized, and bright light sources with tailored coherence.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a novel approach for magnetic modulation of deposition morphology in an evaporating ferrofluid droplet. The magnetic field strength and ferrofluid concentration are kept unchanged, while the actuation frequencies are varied from 0.016 Hz to 5 Hz. In the absence of a magnetic field, a coffee-ring formation is observed and consistent with previous studies\\cite{deegan1997capillary,deegan2000contact,saroj2019drying}. The application of a time-dependent magnetic field significantly modifies the deposition morphology. The periodic magnetic field induces the formation of multiple concentric rings during evaporation. The number of rings initially increases with increasing actuation frequency of the electromagnet. However, beyond a critical actuation frequency ($f_c = 0.2\\,\\text{Hz}$), the number of rings decreases. At higher actuation frequencies, magnetic particles preferentially deposit in the central region of the droplet, resulting in suppression of the coffee-ring effect. Additionally, the thickness of the inner rings and the ring spacing decrease with increasing actuation frequency up to critical actuation frequency. The transition from multi-ring formation to coffee-ring suppression is governed by the competition among magnetic forcing, capillary flow, and particle diffusion. The underlying physical mechanisms responsible for droplet dynamics and deposition morphology under periodic magnetic fields are evaluated using scaling arguments. The results demonstrate that diffusive particle transport plays a dominant role in determining the deposition pattern. A non-dimensional magnetic switching number, based on the magnetic perturbation timescale, is introduced as a control parameter to characterize the frequency-dependent deposition behavior.",

    "abstract": "A new Richardson number formulation, Ri_new, is introduced to improve the diagnosis of turbulence in the stratified free atmosphere, particularly near jet stream regions. The formulation is derived from the turbulent kinetic energy budget and accounts for both vertical wind shear and horizontal shear (deformation and divergence), weighted by the ratio of horizontal to vertical eddy viscosities (Kmh/Kmv). This extends the classical Richardson number Ri_old, which includes only vertical shear, and provides a physically based measure of the balance between stratification and three-dimensional shear production. The diagnostics Ri_new, Ri_old, and the widely used Turbulence Index 1 (TI1), computed from ERA5 reanalysis, are evaluated using more than 247 million automated turbulence reports from commercial aircraft (2017-2024). Across various turbulence intensity thresholds, Ri_new consistently outperforms the other diagnostics, resulting in higher AUC values and improved probability of detection at operationally relevant false-alarm rates. Sensitivity analyses show that the predictive skill of Ri_new is maximized for Kmh/Kmv values in the range 10^3-10^4, with peak performance near 5000 and weak dependence on horizontal resolution. Seasonal and regional evaluations indicate that the added value of Ri_new is largest where turbulence generation involves both vertical and horizontal shear, such as over the contiguous United States and during summer. Over oceans, performance remains high and Ri_new still provides the best overall discrimination skill. These results demonstrate that incorporating horizontal wind shear into the Richardson number yields a physically consistent and statistically robust improvement in turbulence diagnostics, with relevance for research and operational applications.",

    "abstract": "Lying-standing transitions in the first molecular monolayer at organic-inorganic interfaces strongly influence interface dipoles, energy-level alignment, and growth modes, yet their collective kinetics remain difficult to predict. Here, we establish a quantitative adsorbate-to-kinetics relationship using first-principles-based kinetic Monte Carlo simulations combined with a mean-field coarse-graining strategy. Focusing on tetracyanoethylene on Cu(111), we show that the collective transition rate cannot be inferred from any single elementary step but emerges from coupled microscopic processes, including reorientation, adsorption, and diffusion. A local two-step reorientation mechanism captures the diffusion-limited regime, while diffusion of lying molecules accelerates the transition in diffusion-enhanced regimes by suppressing back-reorientation via vacancy-molecule decoupling. This effect is described by a regime-dependent geometric factor accounting for deviations between single-molecule and collective rate constants. By varying molecular size and footprint ratio, we demonstrate that geometry is an intrinsic control parameter. While the collective rate scales approximately with molecular area, increasing the footprint ratio between lying and standing configurations yields order-of-magnitude accelerations due to enhanced vacancy creation and diffusion-assisted stabilization. Finally, we derive an analytical expression for the collective reorientation rate constant linking temperature- and pressure-dependent microscopic rate constants to geometric parameters. The formulation reproduces the simulations across kinetic regimes and provides transferable design principles for engineering lying-standing transition timescales at organic-inorganic interfaces.",

With the rapid advancement of wearable devices capable of acquiring various types of physiological and environmental information, research on electronic textiles (e-textiles)-in which electronic components are integrated into fabrics and clothing-has progressed considerably. However, integrating high-performance, rigid electronic components onto textiles remains challenging: the diameter of textile fibers limits the formation of fine wiring, making reliable mounting of such components difficult. To address these challenges, we devised the UT-Laser technique, in which thin foil or film materials are laser vector-cut on UV tape, and the adhesive strength is controlled through UV exposure. The unnecessary portions are selectively and collectively peeled away to form fine wiring, which is subsequently transferred onto the textile substrate. This approach enables facile fabrication of fine wiring with line widths below 200 $μ$m on textiles. Furthermore, by forming fine wiring from a flexible copper clad laminate and transferring it onto heat-resistant glass cloth, electronic components can be soldered directly, allowing the fabrication of e-textile devices capable of withstanding more than 10,000 bending cycles. The prototype e-textile device fabricated using the proposed method integrates a microcontroller, USB connector, battery holder, flash memory, inertial measurement unit, and environmental sensors, and successfully acquires data related to stair climbing, respiration, and changes in body temperature during sleep.",

The metasurface consists of a square array of Mie-resonant elliptical a-Si:H dimers situated on an SiO$_2$ substrate and embedded in a PMMA film containing Eu(TTA)$_3$. Based on reciprocity principle, it was designed to achieve maximum electric (magnetic) field enhancement in the dimer gap at 610 nm (590 nm) for $x$-polarized ($y$-polarized) normally incident light in order to selectively enhance the electric dipole (magnetic dipole) emission into the $x$-polarized ($y$-polarized) emission channel, respectively. Momentum-resolved spectroscopy and back-focal plane imaging of emission of the fabricated light-emitting metasurface clearly reveal the intended polarization-dependent emission behaviour, with the $x$-polarized ($y$-polarized) emission showing a reduced (enhanced) ratio of the magnetic-/electric dipole emission intensity, correspondingly where the magnetic dipole emission is enhanced with a magnetic field enhancement from the nanostructures. The demonstrated polarization-dependent interaction of a designed nanostructure with the electric- and magnetic dipolar transitions of trivalent lanthanide ions opens an avenue towards routing of emission of different multipolar orders into different polarization channels.",

In recent years, frameworks that explicitly model such higher-order interactions in the interaction backbone (i.e. hypergraphs) have been advanced, somehow shifting the imputation of the effective nonlinearity from the dynamics to the interaction structure. In this short note we discuss such structural-dynamical representation duality, and investigate how and when a nonlinear dynamics defined on the vertex set of a graph allows an equivalent representation in terms of a linear dynamics defined on the state space of a sufficiently richer, higher-order interaction structure. We show that multilinear dynamics defined in the vertices of a graph admit an exact finite realizations as linear dynamics on the state space of a hypergraph. For other high-order interactions involving more general analytic nonlinearities, using Carleman linearization theory we discuss how that the required state space liftings necessary to linearize the dynamics cannot be accomodated to the simple structure of a hypergraph, and a richer combinatorial architecture such as a hb-graph is needed.",

In this work, we present the first comprehensive study of integrated III-V heterostructures operating at cryogenic temperatures down to 5K. Using an integrated n-InP/i-InGaAs/p-InP/p-InGaAs stack monolithically grown on silicon, we identify a temperature-dependent current-lowering mechanism arising from trap states becoming increasingly active below 140K. We demonstrate for the first time that these traps can be equivalently excited and controlled through either thermal or optical energy, revealing a dual modulation mechanism. These findings provide new insights into carrier transport and defect behavior in III-V heterostructures at cryogenic temperatures, advancing the field of cryogenic photonics and offering a non-destructive approach for identifying and characterizing material impurities in integrated quantum and optoelectronic devices.",

    "title": "Self-avoiding tethered surfaces are always flat",
    "abstract": "The scaling behavior of fully flexible elastic tethered surfaces has been debated for decades. Some theories predict that self-avoiding surfaces would crumple in the absence of bending rigidity, while most simulations suggested that they would remain flat. Recent simulations on ideal membranes with lattice perforations suggest that systematically removing surface area from a membrane may provide an alternative way to crumpling self-avoiding surfaces. We perform extensive numerical simulations of two models of fully flexible elastic tethered surfaces in which self-avoidance can be systematically and continuously tuned to the ideal limit. We show that in the thermodynamic limit, these surfaces remain flat with a size exponent $ν=1$ for any finite degree of self-avoidance, with or without membrane perforations.",

    "abstract": "An extended formulation of out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs), which quantify noncommutative operator growth and information scrambling in quantum many-body systems, is developed for turbulence dynamics as a representative of non-canonical Hamiltonian systems. Based on the Wigner-Weyl transform and the Moyal bracket formalism, the semiclassical limit of OTOC for turbulent plasmas governed by the Hasegawa-Mima equation is derived as an ensemble-averaged squared Lie-Poisson bracket between two chosen functionals of the turbulent fields. The classical-limit OTOC provides a quantitative measure of how a variational perturbation applied to one functional propagates across scales in the turbulent dynamics and how it affects another functional at a later time, thereby capturing scale-dependent or field-dependent transfer processes. In a quasilinear approximation with a strong zonal flow, we derive an inverse-square decay of the OTOC with the time lag, indicating an algebraic suppression of the zonal-mode response to perturbations of the non-zonal fields. This behavior is attributed to zonal-flow shearing, which rapidly scrambles the non-zonal perturbation toward higher wavenumbers, and consequently reduces the low-wavenumber non-zonal content that can feed back onto large-scale zonal modes.",

    "abstract": "We present a study of the energy resolution of transition-edge sensors (TESs) for the detection of electrons in the 100 eV kinetic energy range. The TES is a Ti-Au bilayer with an active area of $(60 \\times 60)$ $μ\\text{m}^2$ and a critical temperature of $\\sim$ 80 mK. The electron source is based on vertically-aligned multiwall carbon nanotubes located inside the cryostat, with electrons generated via field emission. For electrons in the (92 - 99) eV kinetic energy range, we obtain a Gaussian energy resolution for fully-absorbed electrons of (0.479 $\\pm$ 0.041 $\\pm$ 0.055) eV. When considering the full-width at half-maximum of the peak, the corresponding resolution is of (1.44 $\\pm$ 0.17 $\\pm$ 0.27) eV. The former represents an improvement of (46 - 60)% with respect to previous results, and is mainly attributed to the reduction in the TES active area. The latter is instead an improvement of over a factor of 20, and is mainly due to the reduction in the emitting area of the electron source, which significantly suppresses electron back-scattering in proximity of the TES. These results represent a major milestone toward high-precision spectroscopy on low-energy electrons, which is a key objective for the PTOLEMY experiment.",

    "abstract": "This paper explores the thermodynamics of fluctuating polytropic processes and their connection to turbulence. It is shown that random fluctuations of polytropic processes produce a nonzero overall heating of a particle system, e.g., solar wind plasma flowing out through the heliosphere; while any nonturbulent heating can be thermodynamically described by typical nonfluctuating polytropic processes, turbulent heating can be thermodynamically described through fluctuating polytropic processes. First, we derive the expression of the overall process and find that polytropic fluctuations lead to heat entering the system even if the respective nonfluctuating process is adiabatic. The temperature of the solar wind plasma protons decreases with heliospheric distance less than the adiabatic cooling, again, similar to when heating enters the system; this subadiabatic cooling is proportional to the variance of the fluctuations. We derive the heliospheric radial profiles of the thermodynamic expressions of the polytropic index, temperature, and heating rates. Then, we show that the analytical profiles of heating of fluctuating polytropic processes and of turbulent heating are identical, suggesting that turbulence heats plasma particle populations by fluctuating their polytropic processes. We apply the thermodynamics of fluctuating polytropic processes to the energy transfer from pickup ions (PUIs) to solar wind plasma protons, and derive the analytical expressions of PUI turbulent and nonturbulent heating rates, which are well fitted to the respective observations. Finally, we apply the thermodynamic model to the radial profile of PUI energy transfer to the solar wind plasma protons, where we derive the portion of PUI turbulent vs. nonturbulent heating rates.",

    "abstract": "This study introduces a pure-amplitude hologram (PAH) for generating radial carpet beams (RCBs), which are conventionally produced using pure phase radial gratings (PRGs). The hologram is designed by embedding the transmission function of a binary PRG into the phase argument of the cosine term(s) of an amplitude linear grating. When illuminated with a plane wave, this hologram generates RCBs in the non-zero diffraction orders, and when illuminated with a Gaussian beam, it generates RCB-like patterns at specific propagation distances. This method entirely eliminates the need for complex and expensive spatial light modulators (SLMs). The study presents a theory of diffraction for plane and Gaussian beams from such holograms, including a specific theoretical treatment of Gaussian beam diffraction from PRGs. Through theoretical analysis and experiments, we demonstrate how different RCBs can be generated at different diffraction orders due to the phase-amplitude enhancement resulting from multiplying the diffraction order number by the phase amplitude of the embedded base PRG, when the illuminating beam is a plane wave. For the Gaussian beam case, we show how different RCB-like patterns can be generated at different diffraction orders for the same reason, though only at specific propagation distances. Experimental and numerical results indicate that this technique yields RCBs and RCB-like patterns with approximately five times the useful power of their SLM-generated counterparts, demonstrating significantly higher power efficiency. This advantage renders the proposed method highly suitable for applications such as multiple optical trapping and free-space optical communication.",

    "abstract": "Wave--particle duality is a hallmark of quantum mechanics. For bosonic systems, there exists a continuum of intermediate states bridging wave-like Schrödinger cat states and particle-like Fock states. Such states have recently been recognized as valuable resources for enhancing fault-tolerant quantum computation (FTQC) with propagating light. Here we experimentally demonstrate tunable generation of these intermediate states by employing generalized photon subtraction (GPS). By detecting up to three photons from squeezed-light sources with a photon-number-resolving detector, we continuously control the balance between wave- and particle-like features. This approach allows us to construct a spectral family of quantum states with high generation rates, optimized according to the required fault-tolerance threshold. Our results establish GPS as a versatile toolbox for tailoring non-Gaussian resources, opening a pathway to efficient Gottesman--Kitaev--Preskill (GKP) qubit generation and addressing a central bottleneck in optical quantum computing.",

    "abstract": "Effective tokamak disruption mitigation is crucial for ensuring the safety and integrity of fusion power reactors. Accurate collisional-radiative (CR) modeling of a radiative plasma is a critical component in predictive disruption mitigation design. In this paper, we focus on quasi-steady-state CR modeling applicable to the current quench phase of a tokamak disruption. We employ the ATOMIC collisional-radiative code from the Los Alamos suite and the newly developed Fusion Collisional-Radiative (FCR) code to model the atomic processes, providing high-fidelity data for radiative power loss, as well as average and effective charge states for hydrogen, helium, neon, and argon plasma species over a wide range of tokamak-relevant electron temperatures and electron densities. Fine-structure-resolved CR models are used for hydrogen and helium plasma species, while configuration-average CR models are implemented for neon and argon plasma species. The calculated values are compared with the superconfiguration CR model (FLYCHK) and the commonly used coronal equilibrium approximation to demonstrate the advantages and limitations of each model. To facilitate coupling of high-fidelity CR data to plasma simulation models, we represent the ATOMIC/FCR results over the relevant plasma parameter range using a smooth tensor product B-spline surface in electron temperature and electron density. This approach yields compact coefficient tables that can be evaluated efficiently while preserving spline smoothness across the domain. These data were previously used to examine ways to minimize runaway electrons in a tokamak current quench, and they are now made available in easy-to-use forms for community use and benchmarking.",

For large tessellations, the Miura-ori sheet generally exhibits a negative in-plane Poisson's ratio, whereas if the size of the Miura-ori tessellations becomes small, the transition between positive and negative Poisson's ratio emerges in the middle of the folding process. Here, we show that such a transitioning point, i.e., zero Poisson's ratio, yields a kinematic locking state. We also experimentally demonstrate the tunable locking behavior altered by tessellation sizes. Extending the analysis to three-dimensional origami tessellations, we find that the direction of kinematic locking changes depending on the tessellation size. Varying tessellation size thus enables control over both the onset and the direction of locking in origami metamaterials.",

    "abstract": "Spatiotemporal modulation approaches have been often employed as alternatives for producing optical non-reciprocity without magneto-optic materials. Unidirectional inter-modal scattering, enabled by either acousto-optic or electro-optic (EO) modulation, is a promising method in this category as it can directly modify optical dispersions and even enables linear non-reciprocal photonic devices in the strong coupling limit. While EO approaches are often preferred for their practicality, it is challenging to generate the large spatiotemporal momentum required for inter-modal phase matching without EO drive schemes involving multiple drive stimuli. Here, we demonstrate highly selective non-reciprocal inter-modal EO scattering enabled by a single high-index radiofrequency (RF) traveling wave stimulus. Our experimental demonstration is performed on a thin-film lithium niobate integrated photonics platform, in which we engineer a slow-wave radiofrequency (SWRF) transmission line with an effective RF index > 9 that natively generates the required RF momentum while simultaneously maintaining strong RF-optical mode overlap. By additionally engineering the interaction length, we achieve a directional ~20 dB non-reciprocal scattering contrast. The SWRF architecture provides a scalable route to magnetic-free non-reciprocity and establishes momentum-engineered RF waves as a powerful tool for next-generation, fully integrated non-reciprocal photonic systems.",

Here, we use nanophotonic structures, specifically micro-pillar and micro-disk resonators, to enhance optical collection and spin-readout. The micro-pillar geometry yields a 4-fold increase in photon collection, accompanied by a 2.4-fold reduction in spectral noise in optically detected magnetic resonance measurements. Consequently, the magnetic field sensitivity is improved by 24%. The large mode volume of the micro-disk supports resonances spanning 1150-1250 nm, enabling broadband coupling to nitrogen vacancy emission lines. Our results demonstrate that fabrication of scalable photonic structures efficiently improves performance of silicon carbide color centers for integrated quantum light generation and sensing.",

    "abstract": "Crystal electromagnetic calorimeters (ECALs) are essential for high-precision measurements of electrons and photons in particle physics experiments. However, the conventional design, in which long crystal bars point radially toward the interaction region and lack longitudinal segmentation, is incompatible with the three-dimensional shower imaging required by Particle Flow Approach (PFA). We propose a novel perspective on crystal ECAL design to address this limitation. The key innovation is a geometric reconfiguration in which crystal bars are oriented to face the interaction region and arranged orthogonally in adjacent longitudinal layers. This layout achieves fine spatial segmentation of energy deposits by correlating measurements of orthogonal crystal bars. An interleaved structure of regular and inverted trapezoidal modules is incorporated to maximize structural uniformity and detector hermeticity. This design is engineered to preserve the excellent intrinsic energy resolution of crystal ECALs while simultaneously providing the detailed three-dimensional shower imaging essential for PFA. Simulation results confirm the feasibility of achieving excellent energy resolution of $1.14\\%/\\sqrt{E} \\oplus 0.44\\%$. Consequently, the proposed design repositions crystal ECAL as a foundational component for PFA-oriented detector systems at facilities such as the Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC), offering a new technical pathway to advance the physics goals of future colliders.",

    "title": "Maximum Likelihood Particle Tracking in Turbulent Flows via Sparse Optimization",
    "abstract": "Lagrangian particle tracking is essential for characterizing turbulent flows, but inferring particle acceleration from inherently noisy position data remains a significant challenge. Fluid particles in turbulence experience extreme, intermittent accelerations, resulting in heavy-tailed probability density functions (PDFs) that deviate strongly from Gaussian predictions. Existing filtering techniques, such as Gaussian kernels and penalized B-splines, implicitly assume Gaussian-distributed jerk, thereby penalizing sparse, high-magnitude acceleration changes and artificially suppressing the intermittent tails. In this work, we develop a novel maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) framework that explicitly accounts for this non-Gaussian intermittency. By formulating a modified Gaussian process to model the random incremental forcing, we introduce a sparse optimization scheme utilizing a convex 1-norm relaxation. To overcome the numerical stiffness associated with high-order difference operators, the problem is efficiently solved using an iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) algorithm. The proposed filter is evaluated against direct numerical simulation (DNS) data of homogeneous, isotropic turbulence (Re approx. 310). Results demonstrate that the IRLS approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art discrete MLE, continuous MLE, and B-spline methods, yielding systematic reductions in root-mean-squared error (RMSE) across position, velocity, and acceleration. Most importantly, the proposed framework succeeds in better recovering the heavy-tailed statistical structure of both acceleration and acceleration differences (jerk) across temporal scales, preserving the physical intermittency characteristic of high-Reynoldsnumber turbulent flows that baseline methods severely attenuate.",

    "abstract": "Over the past few decades, data from leading neutrino experiments have firmly established neutrino oscillation, implying non-zero neutrino masses and leptonic mixing and thereby providing confirmed evidence of physics beyond the Standard Model. On the backdrop of the precision era of neutrino oscillation, this thesis underscores its relevance by demonstrating the physics reach of the forthcoming long-baseline experiments -- Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) and Hyper-Kamiokande (Hyper-K) -- to establish non-maximal $θ_{23}$, resolve the correct $θ_{23}$ octant, and improve the precision on $θ_{23}$ and $Δm^2_{31}$ by efficiently breaking parameter degeneracies. This is enabled by DUNE's high-resolution LArTPC detector and its wide-band beam, achieving sensitivity at a high confidence level compared to the global fits of world neutrino data. The combined analysis of DUNE and Hyper-K not only significantly enhances sensitivity to these phenomenological studies but also demonstrates their capabilities at lower exposures when operated together, relative to their nominal individual exposures. In addition, we investigate the impact of flavor-dependent long-range interactions arising from anomaly-free U(1)' extensions of the Standard Model, showing that although subdominant long-range interactions can substantially influence the sensitivity and precision of oscillation parameter measurements, the complementary strengths of DUNE and Hyper-K mitigate these challenges to a large extent.",

    "title": "Respiratory Motion Management in Abdominal MRI: Revisiting the Gap Between Technical Advances and Clinical Translation",
    "abstract": "The inherently slow acquisition speed of MRI makes abdominal imaging highly sensitive to respiratory motion artifacts. Since the early days of MRI, the development of respiratory motion compensation has been an active research topic, and this field has achieved substantial technical progress. Despite these advances, majority of these techniques are not clinically available, and motion management methods used in clinical abdominal MRI today have changed little over the past decades. This observation is striking and points to a significant gap between technical innovation and clinical translation in this area.   This review is motivated by this question: why have so many motion management techniques not been adopted into routine clinical workflows? Unlike conventional survey-style reviews that focus on summarizing emerging methods, this article takes a different, and perhaps opposite, perspective to investigate why those technologically sophisticated innovations are misaligned with practical clinical needs. Specifically, we discuss the barriers behind the gap between research advances and clinical practice, clarify the clinical requirements for effective respiratory motion management in abdominal MRI, and highlight research directions with stronger relevance to routine workflows.   The review begins with an overview of the clinical impact of respiratory motion in abdominal MRI, followed by a discussion of standard abdominal MRI sequences and their motion sensitivity. We then summarize current clinical strategies and advanced approaches, along with the barriers that hinder their clinical adoption. The article concludes with future directions and broader lessons learned from this translational gap, with the goal of guiding future developments towards improved clinical integration.",

Despite the anisotropic and long-range nature of the interaction, shielding enables a regime in which universality emerges already at the two-body level and extends to the three-body sector, where Efimov physics emerges. On the negative side of the scattering-length resonance, computed trimer binding energies display the characteristic scaling expected for Efimov resonances. Finally, the sudden approximation can be used to create trimer bound states, starting from positive energy trap states as a way to create or detect these molecular trimers.

Using an ensemble of high-resolution three-dimensional direct numerical simulations of an unstable magnetised jet with an initially weak mean field, we demonstrate a self-sustained transition from laminar reconnection to fully developed turbulence in the absence of external forcing. We show that a three-dimensional current-sheet instability triggers stochastic reconnection, leading to persistent turbulent energy injection. Energy-budget analysis reveals that the coupling between the turbulent electromotive force and the magnetic mean shear dominates turbulent production, with magnetic fluctuations subsequently transferring energy to the kinetic field through a nonlinear cascade.",

    "abstract": "The relationship between vascular morphology and hemodynamics is fundamental to understanding the natural history of cerebral aneurysms (CAs). While global geometric indices have been widely studied, the local interaction between luminal curvature and wall shear stress (WSS) remains poorly characterized. This study analyzed a large cohort of CAs to investigate how local surface morphology relates to hemodynamics. This was performed via CFD flow simulations of a set of 76 patient-specific CA geometries using the OpenFOAM library. Geometry and pulsatile inflow conditions were modeled based on patient arterial diameter and age. Blood was assumed to be a Newtonian incompressible fluid flowing in a laminar regime. We utilized a geometric framework to classify the aneurysm lumen into spherical-like and saddle-like patches based on Gaussian curvature. Our results demonstrate a robust, statistically significant correlation between these curvature types and hemodynamic metrics, regardless of rupture status or aneurysm type. Specifically, saddle-like patches, predominantly found at the aneurysm neck, are associated with high time-averaged WSS, a low oscillatory shear index, and intense near-wall vortical activity as identified by the lambda2-criterion. In contrast, spherical-like patches, dominant at the dome, correspond to regions of flow impingement characterized by lower time-averaged WSS and an elevated oscillatory shear index. These findings suggest that wall curvature is a primary determinant of local hemodynamics. By bridging the gap between local wall morphology and pathological wall markers, this work suggests that curvature-based mapping can serve as a powerful tool for identifying vulnerable regions susceptible to thinning and rupture. This objective geometric assessment offers valuable insights for risk stratification and the precision planning of endovascular interventions.",

    "abstract": "Thermophotovoltaic (TPV) cells are increasingly attractive for applications in industrial waste heat harvesting, aerospace energy management, and compact power generation. Deploying midwave-infrared (MWIR) TPV in practical applications requires narrow-bandgap semiconductors that not only absorb low-energy photons but also integrate with scalable, low-cost platforms. Although high-performance TPV devices have been demonstrated using III-V materials such as InAs, GaSb, and InGaAs(P), their use remains limited by cost and substrate size. With this perspective, narrow bandgap GeSn alloys are a promising alternative that extend group-IV absorption into the MWIR while being silicon-compatible. Although the potential of GeSn TPV cells has been predicted, no experimental demonstration has been reported. Here, proof-of-concept Ge$_{0.91}$Sn$_{0.09}$ p-i-n TPV diodes (1 mm diameter) grown on silicon were fabricated and their performance was benchmarked against commercial InAs and extended-InGaAs devices. Measurements at 300 K under 2.33 $μ$m laser and $\\sim$1500 K SiC Globar illumination revealed peak responsivity of $\\sim$ 0.2 A/W at $\\sim$ 1.7 $μ$m, and an output power of $\\sim$ 0.41 mW/cm$^2$. These devices show trends comparable to those of the InAs diode under identical conditions, although at reduced absolute levels. To assess the intrinsic performance potential, Poisson-drift-diffusion modeling incorporating experimentally calibrated emitter emissivity predicts power densities exceeding 1 W/cm$^2$ under moderate MWIR thermal illumination, indicating that the present devices operate far below their fundamental limits and are primarily constrained by defect-assisted recombination and transport losses. These results establish GeSn as a scalable, silicon-compatible MWIR TPV platform and highlight a larger performance potential achievable through material and device optimization.",

Among the seven π* resonances we identified in the guanine-cytosine (GC) anion radical, three were centered on cytosine, and the remaining were guanine-centered. Relative to the isolated bases, upon base pair formation, the cytosine resonances were red shifted, while the guanine-centered states showed an opposite trend - where their energy was blue shifted. In addition to the electronic interactions, geometric distortion and basis set superposition error plays a crucial role in the resonance positions and widths of the GC radical anion. The electronic interaction from the complementary base seems to have a larger effect on the stabilization of the anionic resonances than the surrounding environment.",

We report the first experimental observation of passive freeze-out of RMI in a low-pressure surrogate regime; an instability stagnation effect induced without modifying the driving pressure pulse or the target surface geometry. Using additively manufactured sub-surface voids in a sinusoidal target, we convert a single shock into a sequence of weaker shocks that suppress instability growth upstream of the surface by over 70%. High-speed X-ray imaging and hydrodynamic simulations suggest that this suppression arises primarily from temporal shaping, with lesser contributions from spatial curvature and shock weakening. Our results demonstrate a driver-independent pathway for controlling shock-driven hydrodynamic instabilities relevant to ICF and other high energy density systems.",

    "title": "Structurally Conditioned Diffusion Reproduces Skills-Based Stratification",
    "abstract": "Occupational hierarchies remain strikingly stable even as job content changes rapidly. We ask whether skill requirements propagate directionally along the wage hierarchy or follow symmetric diffusion. Using O*NET 2015-2024, we analyze 17.3 million directed diffusion opportunities linking 873 occupations and 161 skills. We show that propagation obeys an Asymmetric Trajectory Channeling (ATC) rule: the same requirement spreads differently upward and downward, and the asymmetry depends on skill domain and on the architecture of skill dependencies. Two mechanisms generate ATC. Directional incorporation asymmetry implies that wage gradients create distinct receiving environments: upward-moving socio-cognitive requirements encounter complementary infrastructure, whereas upward-moving sensory/physical requirements face structural indifference. Structural portability constraints imply that dependency position governs portability: requirements anchoring long prerequisite chains carry co-adoption burdens that restrict diffusion regardless of destination. Consistent with these mechanisms, socio-cognitive requirements propagate upward more often than downward (20.7% vs 14.9%), while sensory/physical requirements exhibit the mirror pattern (19.5% downward vs 10.3% upward). Nestedness amplifies these asymmetries in opposite directions: scaffolding capabilities ascend most readily, whereas structurally embedded physical requirements are most tightly confined. Identification leverages within-occupation variation in propagation direction, and results are robust to origin- and destination-side specifications. Together, these findings reveal a directional architecture of occupational change that can reproduce hierarchy through ongoing reconfiguration, even absent assortative preferences or coordinated action.",

    "abstract": "Objective. This study investigates the best achievable performance of a brain-dedicated PET system with high resolution and sensitivity by evaluating different detector configurations, while maintaining a practical system design suitable for dynamic brain Imaging. Approach. Monte Carlo simulations were performed to evaluate system sensitivity and image quality under various timing resolutions (200 ps, 100 ps and 50 ps). The PET scanner geometry was optimized for human head imaging, featuring an elliptical cylindrical configuration with a neck cut-out, and front/back panels to enhance sensitivity and line of response (LOR) sampling. Detector configurations using LYSO:Ce crystals of varying thicknesses (15 mm and 20 mm) and depth of interaction (DOI) levels were simulated. Sensitivity was calculated using a point-like 511 keV back-to-back gamma source simulated at multiple locations within the field of view (FOV). Image reconstruction was conducted using list mode Maximum Likelihood Expectation Maximization (MLEM), assessing both a Derenzo-type phantom and a voxelated digital brain phantom. Main results. A location-dependent sensitivity ranging from 35.04% to 13.59% was achieved using a 20 mm thick LYSO:Ce crystal. Spatial resolution ranged from 0.8 mm to 1.5 mm within the FOV without applying resolution recovery techniques, measured using the FWHM of reconstructed hot rods. Previous results using 15 mm crystals with three DOI levels showed sensitivity between 23.42% and 15.99%, confirming the performance benefits of increased detector thickness and DOI capability. Significance. This study demonstrates the potential of a practical, brain-optimized PET system to achieve superior resolution and sensitivity for brain imaging. The findings offer valuable insights into optimal detector configurations, supporting the development of next-generation high-performance brain PET technologies.",

Beyond the conventional magnetic monopoles of spin-1/2 ice, the system hosts additional low-energy crystal-field excitations, whose interplay with monopoles significantly modifies both equilibrium and non-equilibrium properties. Following a thermal quench, we find a pronounced dynamical arrest manifested in an exponentially long-lived {athermal} plateau in spin autocorrelations. This constitutes a rare example of dynamical arrest in a short-range interacting, disorder-free system. We demonstrate that the arrested dynamics originate from novel composite excitation structures unique to spin-3/2 ice and from kinetically constrained relaxation pathways that require activated processes. Our results establish higher-spin ice as a fertile platform for realising unconventional Coulomb spin liquids and dynamical arrest without quenched disorder.",

Hence, developing a mature synthesis technique to obtain wafer-scale, high-quality ultrathin SnSe layers is crucial. In this work, we present a comprehensive study on the effect of growth parameters on the material quality of ultrathin SnSe thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy. A growth window including substrate temperature of 210-270°C and low Se/Sn flux ratio with Se valve position of 10-30 mils has been identified which results in SnSe films with root-mean-square (RMS) roughness as low as 0.6 nm and full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) of 0.1° in SnSe (400) x-ray diffraction (XRD) rocking curve. Finally, using a three-step growth approach, we demonstrate wafer-scale coalesced ultrathin SnSe layers with thicknesses from 20 nm down to 5 nm, with good crystallinity, structural quality, and surface morphology. This work establishes a growth condition framework for MBE-grown SnSe and presents a viable route for developing wafer-scale single-layer films, unlocking the potential of this highly promising material for advanced device integration.",

There is no external potential but the reorientation mechanism generates a non-zero current from asymmetry in the forward and backward waiting-time distributions (even when they have the same mean); the system can therefore can be considered as a type of active particle ratchet. We derive an explicit expression for the mean ratchet current with exponentially distributed reorientation times and also develop a general renewal-theory framework to obtain the full large deviations, using this to comment on the possibility of dynamical phase transitions.",

    "abstract": "Operational probes of the interface between quantum mechanics and general relativity in the Newtonian regime -- via mass-energy equivalence in clocks or spatial superpositions in interferometers -- share a common description in terms of an effective qubit-qubit Ising coupling. Here we generalize both paradigms to interacting $(N+1)$-level effective qudits made of atomic ensembles with particle number, $N$. The many-body enhancement boosts the signal-to-noise and increases the effective interaction rate, facilitating the observation of gravitationally induced entanglement and decoherence, certified by metrological witnesses based on local and collective measurements. Furthermore, we show that quantum effects induced by gravitational interaction can be simulated by trapped bimodal Bose-Einstein condensates with long-range (e.g. dipolar) coupling, providing a programmable analogue platform to explore gravitating quantum dynamics at accessible time and energy scales. Finally, extending the protocol to a sensor network broadens the entanglement-detection window.",

    "abstract": "The R3MBi5 rare-earth intermetallics (R = rare earth, M = Ti, Zr, Sc) provide a versatile platform to explore how Kondo hybridization, RKKY exchange, magnetic frustration, and broken inversion symmetry may cooperate to generate unusual magnetic behavior. We present a comprehensive neutron scattering investigation of the magnetic structure, crystal electric field (CEF), and low-energy excitations in the locally noncentrosymmetric Kondo-lattice compounds Ce3TiBi5 and Ce3ZrBi5. Powder and single-crystal neutron diffraction reveals incommensurate cycloidal antiferromagnetic order in Ce3TiBi5 with propagation vector k = (0, 0, 0.388) and a reduced ordered moment of m = 0.53(3)$μ_{B}$. Ce3ZrBi5 exhibits a qualitatively similar magnetic diffraction profile, with k $\\simeq$ (0, 0, 0.37). Inelastic neutron scattering measurements resolve two clear, well-separated CEF excitations in both compounds with nearly the same profile, confirming a well-isolated Kramers doublet ground state. At low energies, a broad, quasi-elastic magnetic response is observed at T $\\simeq$ TN, whose momentum-dependence is inconsistent with that expected from conventional collective excitations of localized moments. This discrepancy, along with a Kondo temperature estimate TK ~ 3--5 K -- comparable to TN -- indicates sizable Kondo hybridization, which accounts for the moment reduction and the spiral magnetic order that appears to involve the magnetic hard direction. Our results place these compounds in a regime where local inversion symmetry breaking, anisotropic CEF effects, and competing Kondo and RKKY interactions collectively give rise to unconventional magnetic order.",

We show how the discrepancy between laser flash analysis (LFA) and TGS-measured thermal diffusivity varies with grain-boundary density, temperature, and defect concentration. We introduce a dimensionless suppression factor that accounts for this discrepancy and demonstrate its utility by using it to show an agreement between the thermal defect resistance of neutron irradiated 3C-SiC (measured using LFA) and ion irradiated 3C-SiC (measured using TGS).

We find that the stacking geometry plays a decisive role in stabilizing CDW order away from half filling. In particular, parallel-coupled chains exhibit a bistable regime where the normal and dimerized states coexist as local minima of the total energy, while skew-coupled chains display reentrant CDW order upon doping. Our results demonstrate that even minimal models of coupled atomic chains host rich phase diagrams controlled by doping, lattice rigidity, and interchain coupling geometry.",

A particular feature of the phase diagram is the extended quantum phase transition in the Ashkin-Teller universality class that separates the plaquette phase, which spontaneously breaks translation symmetry, and the uniform disordered phase. The former is connected to the Haldane phase, stabilized by large inter-chain coupling, via the topological Gaussian transition. Upon decreasing the inter-chain interactions, this intermediate disorder phase vanishes, giving place to a dimerized phase separated from the plaquette phase on one side via a non-magnetic Ising transition and from the Haldane phase on the other side by a topological weak first-order transition. Finally, in the limit of two decoupled chains, we recover a quantum critical point that corresponds to two copies of the Wess-Zumino-Witten $\\mathrm{SU(2)}_2$ criticality with a total central charge $c=3$.",

Yet it remains unclear whether increasing persistence simply amplifies this effective melting or instead reorganizes the fluidization mechanism itself. Here we show that, in a minimal active-passive mixture, increasing persistence drives a crossover from homogeneous fluidization to a localized mechanical instability, demonstrating that sustained active forcing restructures relaxation in space rather than merely strengthening it. Persistent dopants accumulate stress and nucleate voids as their mechanically perturbed regions overlap. In this regime, rearrangements localize at void boundaries, and active and passive particles exhibit comparable mobility, producing dynamics reminiscent of crowd mosh pits. Persistence therefore reorganizes fluidization through stress accumulation and confinement, revealing a distinct nonequilibrium localization mechanism in disordered solids.",

    "abstract": "We investigate a three-dimensional lattice model of two flavors of massless staggered fermions coupled through two independent four-fermion interactions, $U_I$ and $U_B$. Using large-scale fermion-bag Monte Carlo simulations, we map out the phase diagram in the $(U_I, U_B)$ parameter space and identify three distinct phases: a massless fermion phase, a symmetry-broken massive phase, and a symmetric massive phase. When one of the interactions is absent ($U_B=0$), the system undergoes a single continuous transition directly connecting the massless and symmetric massive phases, a feature previously associated with unconventional fermion mass generation. We find that turning on a nonzero $U_B$ separates this direct transition into two successive transitions with an intermediate symmetry-broken phase. The transition from the massless to the broken phase belongs to the Gross-Neveu universality class, while the transition from the broken to the symmetric massive phase falls into the three-dimensional XY universality class. Our results indicate that the special point at vanishing coupling, where the direct transition occurs, plays the role of a multicritical point organizing the surrounding phase structure. These findings provide a unified lattice perspective on conventional and unconventional mechanisms of fermion mass generation within a single model.",

Furthermore, some fluorinated variants displayed strongly polarized absorption and luminescence, accompanied by a 10x enhancement in photoluminescence quantum yield.

Using molecular dynamics simulations of freestanding glass-forming polymer films, we resolve how depth-dependent variations in segmental relaxation shape chain dynamics across a wide range of displacement scales. Near the free surface, accelerated segmental mobility suppresses Rouse-regime scaling exponents to values as low as gamma = 0.4, reflecting transient localization induced by interfacial mobility gradients rather than topological entanglement. In contrast, the film interior exhibits enhanced Rouse scaling exponents consistent with predictions of the Heterogeneous Rouse Model (HRM), indicating that bulk dynamic heterogeneity compresses the Rouse regime. Mapping the minimum scaling exponent gamma_min across depth reveals a linear gradient that separates the bulk-like enhancement regime from the surface-induced suppression regime of chain dynamical scaling. Together, these results demonstrate that bulk and interfacial dynamic heterogeneity modify chain relaxation in opposite ways and establish Rouse scaling as a sensitive, spatially resolved probe of glassy dynamical heterogeneity and interfacial dynamical gradients in polymers.",

Among various approaches, the finite difference method offers a direct route to capture higher-order EPIs and is compatible with diverse electronic structure solvers. However, its considerable computational cost limits its broader application. To overcome this bottleneck, we present a machine learning electron-phonon interaction (MLEPI) pipeline that predicts force constants and electronic Hamiltonians for modeling EPIs from finite difference calculations, improving efficiency by orders of magnitude without compromising accuracy. The performance of MLEPI is validated by studying the temperature dependence of the electronic band properties in bilayer graphene, where both first- and second order EPIs are treated on an equal footing. Using a heterogeneous edge network, the pipeline integrates both interlayer and intralayer interactions, making it particularly suitable for studying multilayer materials. With its inherent adaptability and ease of transfer to other applications, our methodology provides a robust tool with a very favorable accuracy/efficiency balance for investigating EPIs in large-scale material systems.",

We find that despite mass transfer and sound excitations, the protocol achieves successful cooling during consecutive cycles: the first cycle lowers its temperature by ~20%, and a second cycle yields additional, though reduced, cooling, reaching a final ~27% cooling from the initial state. Our results show that interacting BECs can sustain finite-time quantum thermal cycles under realistic conditions, and provide a platform for exploring different refrigeration schemes, optimized control protocols, and shortcuts to adiabaticity.",

    "abstract": "Training large neural networks exposes neural scaling laws for the generalization error, which points to a universal behavior across network architectures of learning in high dimensions. It was also shown that this effect persists in the limit of highly overparametrized networks as well as the Neural network Gaussian process limit. We here develop a principled understanding of the typical behavior of generalization in Neural Network Gaussian process regression dynamics. We derive a dynamical mean-field theory that captures the typical case learning dynamics: This allows us to unify multiple existing regimes of learning studied in the current literature, namely Bayesian inference on Gaussian processes, gradient flow with or without weight-decay, and stochastic Langevin training dynamics. Employing tools from statistical physics, the unified framework we derive in either of these cases yields an effective description of the high-dimensional microscopic behavior of networks dynamics in terms of lower dimensional order parameters. We show that collective training dynamics may be separated into the dynamics of N independent eigenmodes, those evolution equations are only coupled through collective response functions and a common statistics of an effective, independent noise. Our approach allows us to quantitatively explain the dynamics of the generalization error by linking spectral and dynamical properties of learning on data with power law spectra, including phenomena such as neural scaling laws and the effect of early stopping.",

Silicon based anodes represent a paradigmatic example in Li batteries, as (de)lithiation proceeds through the formation of strongly disordered Li$_x$Si phases and crystal-amorphous transformations that are hard to characterize. Here, we introduce a computational framework that combines machine-learning (ML) prediction of core-level binding energies to large-scale atomistic simulations -- Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) complemented with molecular dynamics (MD), driven by a ML potential -- for a systematic sampling of lithiation states and local atomic environments.

Here we investigate the superconducting, transport,and structural properties of the misfit compound $\\mathrm{(SnS)_{1.15}(TaS_2)}$ under pressures up to 150 GPa. The low-pressure superconducting phase is gradually suppressed and disappears near 14.7 GPa,accompanied by increasing residual resistance. Remarkably, a distinct superconducting phase reemerges above 80 GPa and persists to the highest pressures achieved. This reentrant superconductivity follows a pressure-induced sign reversal of the Hall coefficient near 60 GPa and a nonmonotonic evolution of the normal-state resistance, indicating an electronic reconstruction. No structural phase transition is detected over the entire pressure range. Our results demonstrate a pressure-driven electronic reconstruction leading to reentrant superconductivity in a misfit layered compound, establishing pressure as an effective route to engineer superconductivity and electronic states in natural van der Waals heterostructures.",

    "abstract": "In this study, the influence of pure dislocation and hydrogen-dislocation interactions on anelastic response or internal friction relaxation peaks in bcc-iron was investigated. These relaxations are primarily governed by thermally activated kink nucleation and kink migration events. An atomistic multiscale framework, coupling molecular dynamics (MD) and kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations, was developed to investigate the underlying atomistic mechanisms behind dislocation-relaxation peaks. MD simulations revealed that the presence of hydrogen atoms near the dislocation core facilitates the kink nucleation process by reducing the nucleation barrier while enhancing the barrier for dislocation migration. The KMC model captured Snoek-Koster peaks arising from the Cottrell atmosphere formed by hydrogen atoms and clusters around the dislocation core, providing insights into the atomistic mechanisms controlling these relaxations. Furthermore, the proposed computational scheme elucidated a unique linear relationship between hydrogen content and the internal friction loss factor, offering a methodology for hydrogen detection and quantification.",

Using ab initio molecular dynamics, we investigate Li-ion diffusion in Li3PS4 glass, demonstrating that our structural model reproduces experimental neutron and X-ray diffraction patterns and conductivity measurements. Importantly, we identify a previously unrecognized diffusion mechanism: Li+ ions near isolated sulfur species (Sn with n = 1, 3) display significantly enhanced mobility, with atomic displacements up to 1.7 greater than those associated with bulkier polyhedral units. These results highlight the critical role of free sulfur species in promoting fast ionic transport, providing insights for the rational design of glass compositions with optimized conductivity for solid-state battery applications",

    "abstract": "Adequate characterization of two-dimensional materials with low energy barriers for impurity adsorption is key for advancing applications based on catalysis, sensing, and surface functionalization. However, first-principles methods, such as DFT, are often computationally extremely expensive for feasible large-scale screenings. Given such a scenario, we address a data-driven approach which integrates the semi-empirical Extended Huckel Method with machine learning techniques to estimate adsorption energy barriers in the case of three relevant chalcogen impurities, S, Se and Te. With this aim, we consider the 4036 2D materials found in the C2DB. The scheme employs the EHM to compute energy profiles along three in-plane migration paths, from which average barriers can be derived. The equilibrium distance between the impurity and the 2D surface is not calculated from a tie-consuming geometry optimization. Instead, it is estimated from a simple effective phenomenological expression. Physicochemical descriptors are then obtained from the Matminer library for curated features. Four different ML models are tested, with the XGBoost leading to the highest performance. We further use SHAP to verify the resulting predictions, focusing on the $\\sim1,500$ materials displaying the lowest barrier values. As it could be anticipated, we establish that the average valence electron count, electronegativity, and atomic number are typically the most relevant attributes to validate the ML model. But we also are able to determine, for the different chalcogen atoms, which other few descriptors likewise considerably influence the adsorption properties. Our results show that when combined with interpretable ML protocols, EHM can produce a scalable framework for choosing 2D structures that exhibit the desired capture/release dynamics pertinent in a variety of utilization.",

    "abstract": "In materials science, the selection of structural descriptors for machine learning protocols strongly influences predictive performance and the degree of physical interpretability that can be achieved from the derived models. Although more complex descriptors may improve numerical accuracy, they often represent extra computational load, also reducing transparency into the underlying structural information. A framework called the Dynamic Collision Fingerprint (DCF) was recently proposed with the goal of producing concise, physically significant representations, generating descriptors via dynamical probing of atomic structures. In this work, we benchmark DCF using a dataset composed of 120 two-dimensional carbon allotropes and compare its performance with the widely considered Matminer library. The analysis employs three regression models, linear regression, decision tree, and XGBoost, evaluated over train and test partitions ranging from 10\\% to 90\\% and repeated over multiple random seeds in order to characterize statistical variability. The obtained results demonstrate that DCF easily matches Matminer in terms of predicting accuracy across all learning algorithms. However, it accomplishes this using descriptors that are significantly lower dimensional, pointing to manageable computing costs. Moreover, compared to the rather technical Matminer descriptions, the DCF exhibits considerably clearer physical interpretability. These findings suggest that DCF is a significant substitute for high-dimensional descriptor libraries as structural representation since it is both computationally flexible and physically grounded.",

The rotational-to-translational temperature ratio and the proportionality between the spin-spin and stress tensors are shown to be independent of the coefficient of normal restitution and determined solely by roughness and moment of inertia. The reduced normal stresses, shear stress, and shear rate are obtained explicitly in terms of two effective parameters generalizing the cooling and stress relaxation rates of the smooth model. From these results we derive exact expressions for the non-Newtonian shear viscosity, the first viscometric function, and the friction coefficient. The dependence of the rheological properties on the normal and tangential restitution coefficients is analyzed in detail, revealing strong non-Newtonian behavior and nonmonotonic effects of roughness. The results reduce, in the appropriate limits, to those of the inelastic Maxwell model for smooth particles and to the Pidduck gas in the elastic perfectly rough case.",

In this work, we report the emergence of metastable confinement dynamics in a U(1) lattice gauge theory, originating from the competition between string tension and four-Fermi coupling - a competition that naturally arises in Rydberg atom arrays. We show that the initial string state can be resonantly melted through controlled energy matching, a phenomenon we identify as resonant string breaking. We demonstrate this mechanism for both static and Floquet-driven systems, where periodic modulation generates a spectrum of tunable sideband resonances.

For a single linear defect of strength $ε$, we obtain an exact analytical description of the system spectrum and formulate the dephasing-induced dynamics in the eigenstate basis. We derive an approximate kinetic equation for mode populations that describes a continuous-time random walk in action space. The walk transition rates are defined by the overlap matrix encoding the spatial structure of eigenstates that can be computed exactly. Analyzing the spectral properties of the equation, we show that defect-induced localized modes act as bottlenecks that strongly slow down relaxation, with rates scaling as $ε^{-2}$ for strong defects. Using large-deviation theory, we characterize rare dynamical trajectories and identify distinct relaxation pathways associated with low- and high-activity regimes in action space. We provide numerical evidence that the large-deviation function exhibits a dynamical phase transition in the limit $ε\\to \\infty$. We then extend our analysis to the nonlinear case, considering a single nonlinear defect embedded in either a linear or a fully nonlinear discrete Schrödinger equation. Numerical simulations reveal a qualitatively faster approach to equilibrium driven by the amplitude-dependent weakening of the defect. Our results provide a unified framework for understanding thermalization, rare fluctuations, and relaxation pathways in stochastic tight-binding systems.",

In particular, in order to study the substrate influence on the stabilization of different polymorphic MoS2 phases, the films are synthesised using pulsed laser deposition on substrates with different crystal symmetries and lattice parameters. All the deposited samples are characterized by X-Ray Diffraction, Raman Spectroscopy, Linear Sweep Voltammetry and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy analyses. The films grown on Al2O3 substrates exhibit the best HER performance, likely due to the stabilization of the metastable 1T phase through the interfacial interactions between film and substrate. Presence of the 1T phase in the samples grown on Al2O3 improves the charge transfer efficiency and the electrochemically active surface with a better response to the applied potential, demonstrating their enhanced catalytic behaviour for hydrogen evolution.",

These features allow us to distinguish two clearly different dynamical regimes and to elucidate the mechanism leading to the emergence of a quasi-MQST regime for large particle numbers. These findings bridge the gap between mean-field predictions and exact quantum dynamics and provide insight into the emergence of classical nonlinear behavior from finite quantum many-body systems.",

    "abstract": "We theoretically study surface superconductivity in a nodal-line semimetal by combining a minimal tight-binding model with a layer-resolved Bogoliubov-de Gennes approach. In the normal state, the model realizes a bulk nodal loop and an associated drumhead surface band in a slab geometry with open boundaries in the $z$ direction: the central layers reproduce the bulk-like density of states, whereas the surface layer exhibits a sharp zero-energy peak originating from the drumhead states. On top of this band structure we introduce chiral $p$-wave and $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave superconducting channels and determine the layer-dependent gap amplitudes self-consistently. The chiral $p$-wave order parameter is strongly enhanced at the outermost layers and decays within only a few layers towards the interior, while the $d$-wave order parameter is more than an order of magnitude smaller on all layers. The quasiparticle dispersion and surface local density of states in the chiral $p$-wave state show that the drumhead band is efficiently gapped out and that the zero-energy peak in the normal surface spectrum is split into two coherence peaks, directly reflecting the induced superconducting gap. These results demonstrate that superconductivity driven by drumhead surface states is naturally biased toward a surface-localized chiral $p$-wave pairing symmetry and may offer qualitative guidance for interpreting surface-sensitive experiments on Pd-doped CaAgP.",

    "abstract": "H2-H2O redox cycling of iron powder beds at 650-800 °C offers a compact, safe, economical hydrogen storage method, but sintering-induced capacity loss has stalled its scalability for decades. Here, we show that adding redox-active tungsten to Fe powders solves this problem in static powder beds: Fe-25W (at%) alloyed powder self-foams during redox cycling via W gas-phase transport, increasing porosity and preserving capacity. In a custom automated reactor, a kilogram-scale powder bed reversibly stores 42g H2 and sustains 96+/-3% capacity utilization over 30 redox cycles. Temperature-resolved in-situ X-ray diffraction reveals a chemical-vapor-transport-mediated self-foaming mechanism that redistributes W to refine the microstructure, complemented by a contact-barrier stabilization mechanism during high-temperature holds. Partial-capacity cycling up to 90 cycles further confirms sintering resistance under incomplete redox conditions. These results establish Fe-W powder beds as a robust, scalable, and compact platform for safe, stationary hydrogen storage.",

While the $Λ$CDM paradigm successfully explains structure formation on large scales, its small-scale predictions remain in tension with observations. FDM offers an alternative framework, where local self-interactions can further influence the formation and evolution of structures. We explore both attractive and repulsive contact interactions in static and expanding backgrounds. Using numerical simulations, we examine their impact on three key scenarios: the properties of the lowest-energy stationary solution, the relaxation of localized initial states, and the gravitational collapse of nonlocalized states. Our results show that contact interactions modify the density profile of the stationary solution and affect the onset of characteristic stages of gravitational collapse, particularly the shell-crossing event. In the (1+1) model, we confirm that relaxation does not converge to the lowest-energy stationary solution, even when local self-interactions are included. Taken together, local self-interactions play a relevant role in shaping the nonlinear dynamics of FDM and motivate further studies in higher-dimensional and cosmologically realistic settings.",

Based on Bogoliubov de Gennes calculations, we further demonstrate that this state supports Majorana surface modes, establishing its intrinsically topological nature.

    "abstract": "Employing a renormalization group analysis that allows for an unbiased treatment of competing physical ingredients, we systematically trace how the interplay between Cooper pairing and disorder scatterings governs the emergence or suppression of Cooper instability in the low-energy regime of fractional Dirac semimetals.In the clean limit, we find that the emergence of Cooper instability requires surpassing a finite interaction threshold $|λ_c|$, and depends sensitively on both the fractional exponent $α$ and the transfer momentum $\\mathbf{Q}=(Q,φ)$. Specifically, bigger values of $α$ enhance the tendency toward BCS instability. For $α\\in(0.001,0.61)$, the $(Q,φ)$ parameter space separates into two distinct regions: Zone-\\uppercase\\expandafter{\\romannumeral1}, where Cooper instability is suppressed, and Zone-\\uppercase\\expandafter{\\romannumeral2}, where it is allowed. In the presence of disorders, we demonstrate that they can either promote or suppress Cooper instability. Disorder of type $Δ_1$ or $Δ_2$ enhances superconductivity by reducing the critical interaction threshold $|λ_c|$ and expanding the superconducting phase space (Zone-\\uppercase\\expandafter{\\romannumeral2}). In sharp contrast, either $Δ_0$ or $Δ_3$ suppresses Cooper pairing by increasing $|λ_c|$ and shrinking the available phase space (Zone-\\uppercase\\expandafter{\\romannumeral1}). Although Cooper instability can be enhanced when promotive disorders ($Δ_1$, $Δ_2$) coexist with a single suppressive disorder ($Δ_0$ or $Δ_3$), the suppressive influence of $Δ_{0,3}$ generally dominates the promotive effects of $Δ_{1,2}$ in the presence of all sorts of disorders. These results would be helpful for further studies of fractional Dirac semimetals and alike materials.",

    "abstract": "Thermal quenching (TQ) generally occurs in phosphors and is ascribed to the activation of non-radiative transitions at elevated temperatures. This effect limits the use of most phosphors in high-power/high-temperature applications, such as outdoor lighting and laser systems. To achieve anti-TQ properties, structural design of phosphors is required. This usually follows two guidelines: (1) increasing lattice rigidity to minimize thermal expansion; (2) converting thermal energy into radiative transitions to compensate for the non-radiative losses. While metal oxides and metal nitrides dominate the field of commercial anti-TQ phosphors, metal halides - despite their inherently soft lattices - have shown remarkable progress as anti-TQ phosphors in recent years. Here, we review the advances in anti-TQ metal halides (covering the time span from 2017, when first reports have appeared, till today) and discuss their mechanisms and applications. We argue that the low synthesis temperatures of metal halides and their high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) make them promising candidates as anti-TQ phosphors. Furthermore, since the rich optical-physical processes underlying the anti-TQ effect in soft-lattice in metal halides are only now beginning to be unraveled, this creates opportunities for many fundamental investigations.",

Recent experiments have uncovered a novel form of altermagnetism with distinctive $g$-wave symmetry in CrSb. However, the potential for unconventional superconductivity arising from $g$-wave altermagnetism in such systems remains largely unexplored. In this study, we discover the emergence of chiral superconducting states in three-dimensional $g$-wave altermagnetic metals. Through systematic self-consistent mean-field analysis on the extended attractive Hubbard model combined with $g$-wave altermagnetic exchange fields in a three-dimensional hexagonal lattice, as observed in CrSb, we find that the altermagnetic spin splitting of Fermi surfaces favors chiral $p$-wave states as the dominant pairing channel under strong altermagnetic fields and high electron densities, while chiral $d$-wave states become predominant under weak altermagnetic fields and intermediate electron densities. Conversely, at weak altermagnetic fields and typical electron densities, non-chiral $s$-, extended $s$-, or $f$-wave states become stabilized. We also showcase the possible experimental detection using the quasiparticle energy dispersions and the density of states to distinguish different pairing symmetries. These findings underscore the potential of $g$-wave altermagnets to host sought-after chiral and gapless superconductivity.",

    "abstract": "Although the considerable potential of luminescence thermometry based on emission kinetics has been widely demonstrated, reliable tools for the intentional prediction of thermometric performance remain limited. To address this challenge, the present work introduces an approach that enables a theoretical description of the 2E state lifetime of Mn4+ ions, as well as the absolute and relative sensitivities, in terms of the nephelauxetic effect within the group of double perovskites: Sr2InNbO6, Sr2InTaO6, Ba2InTaO6, and Ba2InNbO6. Our results clearly show that, contrary to common assumptions, the Dq/B ratio is not the primary factor governing either the spectroscopic behavior of Mn4+ ions or the thermometric performance of Mn4+-doped phosphors. Instead, the nephelauxetic beta1 parameter plays the dominant role. The empirical analysis carried out in this study led to the development of a predictive model that enables estimation of SAMAX and SRMAX values based exclusively on beta1. This methodology represents a significant step toward the rational design of lifetime-based luminescence thermometers with predefined thermometric characteristics tailored to the requirements of specific applications.",

    "abstract": "The discovery of novel carbon allotropes with tailored thermal and mechanical properties is critical for advanced thermal management. However, exploring the vast configurational space of carbon using \\textit{ab initio} calculations remains computationally prohibitive. Driven by the rich topological landscape of carbon, where the competition between $sp, sp^2,$ and $sp^3$ hybridization states dictates material performance, we establish a closed-loop AI framework to explore this complex configurational space. We introduce a hybridization entropy descriptor to guide the search beyond conventional forms. Here, we establish a closed-loop AI framework that synergizes a Large Language Model (LLM) for structural generation with a Machine Learning Potential (MLP) for accelerated evaluation. Leveraging CrystaLLM to generate candidates and an iteratively refined MLP for high-fidelity validation, we screened thousands of structures to identify several stable allotropes with exotic properties. Specifically, we report ``yne-diamond C$_{12}$'' and ``yne-hex-diamond C$_{8}$'', which exhibit extreme thermal anisotropy and ultralow in-plane shear stiffness arising from their mixed $sp$-$sp^3$ hybridization. Furthermore, we discovered a complex $sp$-$sp^2$-$sp^3$ hybridized C$_{12}$ phase that combines metallic conductivity with an anomalous negative Poisson's ratio. Notably, we identified a superhard phase (C16_3) possessing a calculated Vickers hardness (103.3 GPa) exceeding that of diamond 96 GPa). Microscopic analysis reveals that thermal transport in these materials is governed by the interplay between rigid frameworks and flexible linkers.

Furthermore, we investigate the temperature dependence of several commonly used observables in the model. As representative results, we achieve an accurate map of the thermal entropy across the crossover diagram, and identify the parameter regions in which the model exhibits the Pomeranchuk cooling, characterized by an adiabatic cooling with increasing $U$.

Here, we report a biomimetic regime of directron dynamics in achiral nematic liquid crystals, in which coherent, directed motion collectively evolves into chaos. Driven by multi-directron interactions, the system develops coexisting directron families with competing trajectories, displaying randomized motion, dynamic assembly formation and spontaneous fission of high energy to low energy daughter directrons - all of which mimics the phenotypic diversity observed in biological groups. Above a critical electric field, these interactions drive the system into a chaotic state that is distinct from the directed behaviours reported previously. We further introduce a minimal dipole-based model that qualitatively captures the underlying physics of this transition. Together, our results establish an artificial active system in which chaos emerges intrinsically from interactions, offering a versatile platform to study biological dynamics and opening new avenues for liquid-crystal-based soft-matter applications involving adaptive transport, cargo delivery, and energy transduction",

For this model, we prove that physical quantities on the Nishimori line (NL) can be expressed exactly in terms of those of the pure Ising model at an effective temperature on any lattice in any dimension. For example, the energy on the NL is equal to the energy of the pure Ising model at the effective temperature up to a constant and a trivial factor. More remarkably, the specific heat on the NL equals the energy, not the specific heat, of the pure Ising model at the effective temperature, again up to a constant and a trivial factor. Gauge-noninvariant quantities such as the magnetization and correlation functions are exactly equal to the corresponding quantities of the pure Ising model at the effective temperature. These exact relations imply that the leading critical behavior at that multicritical point for the disorder-correlated model is pure-Ising-like, in contrast to the conventional multicritical universality class of the standard Edwards-Anderson model. Our results motivate further investigations of the relatively unexplored topic of correlations in disorder in spin glasses and related problems.",

    "abstract": "Fluctuations are intrinsic to microscopic systems and impose fundamental limits on nonequilibrium precision, as captured by the thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR), which links current fluctuations to entropy production. While feedback control is expected to further suppress fluctuations, its role within the TUR framework has remained unclear, particularly in quantum systems where control is inherently information-driven. In this Letter, we consider open quantum systems weakly coupled to a thermal environment, in which quantum jumps are continuously monitored, and Markovian feedback is applied. Using quantum mutual information to quantify the information contribution induced by feedback, we derive a finite-time TUR for arbitrary time-integrated currents in terms of entropy production and mutual information. Our results uncover how feedback control suppresses fluctuations together with thermodynamic cost and establishes a fundamental precision bound imposed by information-based control. As an application, we analyze a quantum clock model and demonstrate that the clock precision can be enhanced by feedback control in the presence of a single thermal reservoir.",

    "abstract": "Cooper-pair density modulation (CPDM) states are superconducting phases in which the order parameter varies periodically in real space without breaking translational symmetry. Recently, moire superlattices in layered materials have emerged as powerful platforms for engineering charge density with tunable lattice symmetry, offering a new route to creating and controlling CPDM states. In this work, we demonstrate moire-induced CPDM states in a bilayer heterostructure formed by epitaxially stacking one quintuple layer (1 QL) of topological insulator Sb2Te3 on a six-unit-cell (6 UC) antiferromagnetic FeTe layer. Scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/S) measurements reveal a moiré superlattice formed between the hexagonal Te lattice of Sb2Te3 and the square Te lattice of FeTe, which spatially modulates the two superconducting gaps of the 1 QL Sb2Te3/6 UC FeTe bilayer. Our Josephson STM/S measurements provide direct real-space imaging of the CPDM states with a wavelength corresponding to the periodicity of the moire superlattice. By substituting Sb2Te3 with Bi2Te3, we achieve control over both the periodicity and magnitude of the CPDM states. Our work demonstrates an epitaxial strategy for synthesizing moire superlattices from materials with different crystal symmetries and reveals a new mechanism for engineering CPDM states in designer bilayer heterostructures.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the dynamical origin of high--temperature superconductivity remains a central challenge of strongly correlated quantum matter. Conventional approaches to quantum criticality assume overdamped Markovian dissipation governed by Ohmic Landau damping. Here we show that infrared collective dynamics is instead generically controlled by the time--scale density of states (TDOS) of relaxation modes. Within the Martin--Siggia--Rose--Janssen--De Dominicis formalism, we derive an exact spectral representation of the collective susceptibility in terms of the TDOS. A finite infrared TDOS defines a new universality class of memory--dominated critical dynamics characterized by long--time kernels $K(t)\\sim1/t$ and nonanalytic dynamical response. This spectral reorganization produces a strong infrared amplification of the particle--particle channel, converting the marginal instabilities of BCS and Eliashberg theories into algebraic superconducting transitions. As a result, the transition temperature scales linearly with the infrared spectral weight of slow collective modes, naturally yielding superconducting domes and Uemura scaling without invoking bosonic glue or fine tuning. The same slow--mode reservoir governs anomalous normal--state dynamics, including long--time correlations and strange--metal behavior, providing a unified description of thermodynamic and dynamical phenomena in correlated superconductors. Our results establish dynamical spectral organization as a fundamental principle of quantum critical matter and identify memory--dominated criticality as a generic route to high--temperature superconductivity.",

Here, combining first-principles calculations with symmetry analysis, we identify two stable boron allotropes, chiral HDSBC-B$_{20}$ and cage-like CR-B$_{12}$, as the first nonmagnetic electronic materials realizing a single pair of WPs in the spinless regime. We show that the interplay between time-reversal symmetry and crystallographic rotation symmetry ($C_4$ or $C_3$) stabilizes exactly one pair of $C=2$ WPs pinned at time-reversal-invariant momenta, thereby circumventing the conventional node-quartet constraint. These double-WPs exhibit linear dispersion along the rotation axis and quadratic dispersion in the perpendicular plane. In HDSBC-B$_{20}$, the sign of the topological charge is directly correlated with structural chirality. Both materials host exceptionally long double Fermi arcs spanning the surface Brillouin zone, providing experimentally accessible signatures. Our findings establish nonmagnetic material platforms for minimal double-Weyl fermions and broaden the landscape of unconventional WSMs.",

    "abstract": "We study when a density-matching Kohn--Sham (KS) description can reproduce a many-body Berry phase in a correlated insulator, despite the fact that geometric phases are functionals of the wave function. Focusing on the one-dimensional SSH--Hubbard chain on a ring as a controlled interacting topological model, we introduce a $U(1)$ twist $θ$ (flux insertion). The many-body ground state along the full twist cycle is computed by the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG), while the onsite interaction $U$ is tuned from the noninteracting to the strong-coupling regime. At half filling in the inversion-symmetric gapped regime, our DMRG calculations show that the density remains constant within numerical accuracy over the entire $(θ,U)$ range studied. Thus, the density has no dependence on either the flux $θ$ or the interaction strength $U$. Accordingly, the symmetry-preserving density constraint collapses the KS reference to an SSH-type quadratic representative with $U$-independent geometric diagnostics. Nevertheless, the many-body wave function exhibits a nontrivial geometric response: the quantum metric associated with the $θ$-parametrized ground-state manifold depends on $θ$ at intermediate $U$ and is strongly suppressed at large $U$, consistent with the charge fluctuation freezing. Intriguingly, the KS and many-body Berry phases coincide throughout the gapped regime as $U$ is tuned from weak to strong coupling. We show that this agreement is best understood as symmetry-enforced $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ sector matching, rather than as evidence that the density encodes the many-body Berry connection.",

Notably, the WPs in P6-B$_{48}$ are pinned to high-symmetry points, while those in TBIN-B$_{48}$ lie along high-symmetry lines, leading to distinct and experimentally accessible surface states, including single and double Fermi arcs.

In multi-orbital systems where bands have strongly mixed orbital composition, quantum geometry plays a vital role in determining the ground state and low-energy properties of interacting electronic systems. In this work, we show that Mott metal-insulator transitions, as well as transitions between different magnetic orders within the Mott insulating phase, can be driven by the quantum geometry of the underlying Bloch band, thereby providing a mechanism complementary to conventional bandwidth-tuned Mott transitions. By studying the Kane-Mele-Hubbard model using exact diagonalization, we demonstrate that in in half-filled and topologically-trivial bands, quantum geometric properties of the Bloch states alone can act as a tuning knob for Mott metal-to-insulator and affect the competition between ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. We show that both transitions may be heuristically understood via non-local Coulomb scattering in a basis of exponentially localized Wannier functions. These results highlight the role of quantum geometry beyond topological settings as a governing principle for conventional Mott and magnetic physics in multi-orbital and moiré materials.",

Here, we demonstrate an interpretable self-driving laboratory framework that transforms autonomous optimization into human-usable growth rules. As a stringent benchmark, we apply this framework to RF magnetron sputtering, addressing a long-standing challenge of achieving high-quality beta-Ga2O3 heteroepitaxy and single-crystalline beta-Ga2O3 homoepitaxy via sputtering. By combining Bayesian optimization with automated optical evaluation of the Urbach energy as a metric of sub-bandgap disorder, the self-driving system efficiently identifies heteroepitaxial growth conditions yielding a minimum Urbach energy of 182 meV, the lowest value for sputtered beta-Ga2O3 films. Importantly, the optimized growth window is transferable, realizing single-crystalline beta-Ga2O3 homoepitaxy without further optimization, corroborated by scanning transmission electron microscopy. To convert the closed-loop dataset into interpretable growth rules, we train a random forest surrogate and distill it into response curves and quantified pairwise interactions across the four-dimensional growth-parameter space. This analysis identifies substrate temperature as the primary control knob, with RF power and gas flows acting largely additively and only a modest temperature-oxygen coupling delineating the narrow window for high-quality growth, establishing a general route from autonomous experimentation to transferable growth rules.",

This was accomplished using two different approaches, by changing the number and location of layers that can generate SHG computationally and by exploiting the symmetry of a crystal, a similar pattern emerged. We find that by 1000 eV, well above the ~285 eV of the C $K$-edge, the SHG of diamond is dominated by the bulk, quadrupole response, in agreement with our analytic calculations. The bulk response continues to grow as the energy is increased, becoming overwhelming by 7000 eV. Near the C $K$-edge the measurement is quite surface sensitive, however, this surface sensitivity reduces as the energy increases such that by 1000 eV (and certainly by 3500 eV) SHG is largely bulk sensitive. Moreover, we find that the specific details of the crystal orientation (i.e., comparing a (001)-terminated and (111)-terminated surface) appear to have significant effects on the surface sensitivity.",

Stealthy hyperuniform configurations are generated using generalized cost functions that interpolate between square-lattice-like and triangular-lattice-like arrangements. Using linear spin-wave theory for the mixed-spin model, we demonstrate that triangular-lattice-like arrangements yield a larger average staggered magnetization than both random and square-lattice-like cases. This enhancement originates from sublattice effects: while the square-lattice-like configuration enforces nearest-neighbor impurities to occupy opposite sublattices due to its bipartite structure, the triangular-lattice-like arrangement allows same-sublattice nearest-neighbor pairs, thereby strengthening cooperative magnetic enhancement.",

However, the realization of these phases remains limited in van der Waals materials, and the full landscape of strong correlations remains uncharted in any context. While interactions between conduction electrons and localized spins yield a well-known competition between heavy fermions (Kondo hybridization) and magnetic order (RKKY exchange), such spin-driven competition represents only part of the correlated electron phase diagram. Here we demonstrate that a heavy-fermion state can also compete with charge order, such as the charge density wave (CDW) state typical in the van der Waals $4f$ rare-earth tritellurides (RTe$_3$). We exploit the spatially-extended $5f$ orbitals of $β$-UTe$_3$ to enhance Kondo hybridization compared to its isostructural RTe$_3$ cousins. Our scanning tunneling spectroscopy on $β$-UTe$_3$ shows Fano resonances characteristic of the heavy fermion state, while our quasiparticle interference imaging reveals the disappearance of Fermi-level nesting and the appearance of flat bands. We extend the tritelluride tight-binding model to include Kondo coupling and quantify the Fermi surface reconstruction. Consistent with the destruction of nesting, we observe no CDW in $β$-UTe$_3$. Our expansion of the Kondo phase diagram beyond spin-mediated competition opens new possibilities for proximity-induced phase engineering in correlated van der Waals heterostructures.",

Here, we investigate the role of substitutional disorder in Remeika-type quasiskutterudites $R_3M_4$Sn$_{13}$ and $R_5M_6$Sn$_{18}$ ($R=$ Y, La, Lu; $M=$ Co, Rh, Ru) by combining measurements of magnetic susceptibility, electrical resistivity, and heat capacity with microscopic modeling. We demonstrate that increasing disorder leads to the emergence of locally superconducting regions characterized by an enhanced critical temperature $T_c^{\\ast}$, exceeding the bulk transition temperature $T_c$.   Both $T_c^\\ast$ and $T_c$ exhibit a nonmonotonic dependence on dopant concentration and show a strong correlation with entropy isotherms measured as a function of disorder. The pronounced entropy maxima coincide with the largest separation between $T_c^{\\ast}$ and $T_c$, establishing disorder as a thermodynamically controlled parameter governing superconductivity in these materials. Measurements of the upper critical field reveal distinct $H_{c2}(T)$ branches associated with the bulk and locally superconducting phases, providing direct experimental evidence for a percolative superconducting state.   To interpret these observations, we propose a microscopic model that captures the interplay between the impurity-induced enhancement of local pairing and the disorder-driven suppression of global superconducting coherence. The model reproduces the experimentally observed nonmonotonic evolution of $T_c^{\\ast}$ with disorder and supports a percolation-based interpretation of the superconducting transition. Our results demonstrate that controlled atomic disorder can serve as an effective materials-design parameter for tuning superconductivity in complex correlated systems.",

A complementary understanding of the stability of the scars under different perturbations is obtained by analyzing the Loschmidt echo and Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) of the scars. Finite-size scaling analysis of the QFI reveals that the scars are much more sensitive to perturbations as compared to the nearby thermal states.

By employing a mean-field approach and Monte Carlo simulations for self-avoiding walks on the cubic lattice, we investigate the system's response to an external magnetic field. We discover a rich phase diagram that includes: a swollen phase with both filaments magnetically disordered and spatially extended; a mixed compact phase characterized by a single globule in which the two filaments are strongly intertwined; a segregated compact phase composed of two globular, magnetically ordered, and spatially separated blocks. Further, if the magnitude of the intra-block ferromagnetic interaction differs between the two blocks, we observe a hybrid segregated (``tadpole'') phase where one extended block coexists with a collapsed one. Mean-field predictions are in quantitative agreement with Monte Carlo results for the location of the phase boundaries. These findings provide a minimal statistical-mechanical framework for field-controlled self-assembly of tunable patterns by magnetically heterogeneous polymers. They may also serve as a simple platform to investigate the coupling between internal epigenetic-like states and chromatin folding.",

    "abstract": "We numerically investigate quantum circuit elementary-gate level instantiations of the standard Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) algorithm for the task of computing the ground-state energy of a quantum magnet; the disordered fully-connected quantum Heisenberg spin glass model. We consider (classical simulations of) QPE circuit computations on relatively small quantum Hamiltonians ($3$ qubits) with up to $10$ phase bits of precision, using up to Trotter order $10$. We systematically study the inputs of QPE, specifically time evolution, Trotter order, Trotter steps, and initial state, and illustrate how these inputs practically determine how QPE operates. From this we outline a coherent set of quantum algorithm input and tuning guidelines. One of the notable properties we characterize is that QPE sampling of the optimal digitized phase converges to a fixed rate. This results in strong diminishing returns of optimal phase sampling rates which can occur when the Trotter error is surprisingly high.",

    "abstract": "Metric networks are network-shaped, one-dimensional structures on which one can solve differential equations to simulate a wide range of physical systems including conjugated molecules, photonic crystals, quantum mechanics in waveguide networks, and acoustic metamaterials. More concretely, a metric network is a network whose edges are each assigned a notion of length and a coordinate describing position. One can then define function spaces and differential operators on these objects to model the aforementioned systems. Recent software advancements have made it feasible to analyze partial differential equations on large, compact metric networks with a vast array of structures. Here, we generate compact metric network structures using the spatial tessellations of two-dimensional hyperuniform point patterns, which have suppressed large-scale density fluctuations relative to typical disordered point patterns. This choice of structure is inspired by the exotic physical properties of network materials with these structures in other contexts. Then, we characterize the eigenvalue spectrum structure of the differential Laplace operator on these networks. In particular, we find that gaps can form in the eigenvalue spectra of these networks whose widths increase when the distribution of edge lengths is narrow and as the number of triangular faces increases. Importantly, many of the structures we consider are realizable in Euclidean space, meaning they are well-suited for practical applications in, e.g., metamaterial design. This work can thus be used to inform the design of metric network-based systems with spectral gaps with tunable widths and locations.",

    "abstract": "The notion of operator growth in quantum systems furnishes a bridge between transport and the generation of entanglement between different parts of the system under quantum dynamics. We define a measure of operator growth in terms of subsystem operator Rényi entropy, which provides a state-independent measure of operator growth, unlike entanglement entropies, and the usual measures of operator growth like out-of-time-order correlators. We show that the subsystem operator Rényi entropy encodes both spatial and temporal information, and thus can directly connect to transport for a local operator related to a conserved quantity. We construct a unified Schwinger-Keldysh (SK) field theory formalism for the time evolution of operator Rényi entropy and entanglement entropies of initial pure states. We use the SK field theory to obtain the operator Rényi and state entanglement entropies in terms of infinite-temperature and vacuum Keldysh Green's functions, respectively, for non-interacting systems. We apply the method to explore the connection between operator and entanglement growth, and transport in non-interacting systems with quasiperiodic and random disorder, like the one- and two-dimensional Aubry-André models and the two-dimensional Anderson model. In particular, we show that the growth of subsystem operator Rényi entropy and state von Neumann and Rényi entanglement entropies can capture both ballistic and sub-ballistic transport behaviors, like diffusive and anomalous diffusive transport, as well as localization in these systems.",

For parabolic-band bilayers, we identify two characteristic signatures which are observable in lateral conductance: Landau-Zener-Stuckelberg oscillations in the band-overlap regime periodic in $1/F$ at small fields, resembling electric-field induced quantum oscillations, and a pronounced resonance at $F\\propto T_0^{3/2}$ set by the interlayer tunneling $T_0$. These features provide a directly accessible probe of coherent interferometric dynamics in van der Waals heterostructures, and could be harnessed for more precise engineering and characterization.",

This allows the Hamiltonian topology to act as a knob for controlling Liouvillian topology and corresponding non-equilibrium dynamics, rather than being passively manipulated by system-environment exchanges. In particular, by exactly solving the Liouvillian spectrum in a class of one-dimensional dissipative lattices, we find that the Hamiltonian band topology constrains the Liouvillian spectral winding and determines the Liouvillian skin effect, provided the Hamiltonian and quantum jump operators respect the same chiral symmetry. We further demonstrate that lattice parity controls the associated bulk-boundary correspondence and the coherence properties of the steady state. Our results unveil a symmetry-enforced topological control of spectral and spatial organization in open quantum systems, providing a unified perspective on topology in Hamiltonian and dissipative dynamics.",

We show that detecting this phase in a fractional quantum Hall interference experiment results in a quantum Zeno effect: a localized anyon is trapped by constant observation from a stream of anyons supplied by the measurement current. Interferometers with an embedded antidot are ideal for accessing the Zeno regime, where the bare tunneling rate of localized anyons is much lower than the measurement rate. The Zeno-suppressed tunneling rate of the trapped anyon depends on the braiding phase and the transmission of the quantum point contacts. Our primary prediction is that the autocorrelation time of the conductance through the interferometer increases with the bias current. This effect may be used to experimentally control the anyon dynamics, in particular to increase the lifetime of localized anyons.",

Our results provide a microscopic explanation for the experimentally observed orientation dependence of superconductivity at KTO-based interfaces.",

Reversibility in the thermodynamic sense is understood as entropy-preserving processes, such as in the idealized Carnot engine, whereas in integrable dynamical systems it is understood as the conservation of the action variables. Between these two idealized limits, however, where the phase space can become mixed, things are much less clear. In this work, we first determine the extent to which reversible processes are even possible in this regime. We then explore how the dissipative losses resulting from rapidly driving these kinds of systems can be fought by approximate counterdiabatic driving. Finally, we argue that much of the phenomenology should be the same for quantum many-body systems with large degeneracy in the presence of integrability breaking perturbations.",

By combining perturbation theory, exact diagonalization, and a classical energy-minimization method, we show that an effective staggered magnetic field originating from the vdW antiferromagnet can drive a monolayer of a Kitaev material into various novel phases, including an antichiral Kitaev spin liquid, a nonmagnetic nematic phase, and different types of skyrmion crystals. We then apply first-principle simulations to assess the prospect of concretely realizing this setup in a heterobilayer of $α$-RuCl$_3$ and the easy-axis antiferromagnet MnPS$_3$.",

    "abstract": "We investigate thermal avalanche dynamics in amorphous solids using elastoplastic models with local activation rules and no external driving. Dynamical heterogeneities, quantified through persistence measurements and the associated four-point susceptibility $χ_4$, reveal the emergence of correlated spatiotemporal rearrangements as temperature is varied. As temperature increases, avalanche statistics evolve from scale-free behavior with exponential cutoffs to regimes dominated by system-spanning runaway events. We identify a system-size-dependent critical temperature $T_c(L)$ that separates intermittent avalanche dynamics from thermally assisted flow, where self-sustained avalanches transiently fluidize the system. We show that $T_c(L)$ decreases algebraically with increasing system size, suggesting that in the thermodynamic limit arbitrarily small but finite temperatures may destabilize the intermittent regime. The relation between avalanche size and duration resembles that in sheared systems, whereas the statistics of minimal distances to yielding reveal a temperature-driven reorganization of marginal stability absent in strictly driven overdamped dynamics. Our results demonstrate that thermal activation alone can generate a finite-size-controlled instability scale in disordered elastic media.",

An exemplary framework is provided by Weyl-Kondo semimetals, in which Weyl fermions develop through crystalline symmetry constraints on the emergent low-energy heavy-fermion excitations. This paradigm has opened up new opportunities to explore correlated topologies without a noninteracting counterpart, but fully realizing this potential requires a large base of candidate materials. Here we confront the challenge on both fronts by studying heavy fermion systems with hexagonal space groups. This family contains a large number of chiral nonsymmorphic crystal structures that promote Weyl degeneracies and, in addition, feature geometric frustration in the $f$-electron magnetism. Our calculations for the heavy fermion states identify Weyl-Kondo semimetals with chiral or achiral Weyl nodes in the respective structural classes. We also develop a new search strategy for the difficult case of strongly correlated materials, using a combination of materials database, symmetry classification and experiments, and propose as candidate topological heavy fermion systems the chiral CePt$_2$B and achiral Ce$_2$NiGe$_3$ and Ce$_6$Co$_{2-δ}$Si$_3$.

    "abstract": "Circuit quantum acoustodynamics (cQAD) devices have a wide range of applications in quantum science, all of which depend crucially on the quantum coherence of the mechanical subsystem. In this context, high-overtone bulk acoustic-wave resonators (HBARs) are particularly promising, since they have shown very high quality factors with negligible dephasing. However, the introduction of piezoelectric films, which are necessary for coupling to a superconducting circuit, can lead to additional loss channels, such as surface scattering and two-level systems (TLS). Here, we study the acoustic dissipation of HBAR resonators in cQAD systems and find that the defect density of the piezoelectric material and its interface with the bulk are limiting factors for the coherence. We measure acoustic modes with phonon lifetimes up to 400 $μ$s and lifetime-limited coherence times approaching one millisecond in the quantum regime. When coupled to a superconducting qubit, this leads to a hybrid system with a large quantum coherence cooperativity of $C_{T_2}=1.1\\times10^5$. These results represent a new milestone for the performance of cQAD devices and offer concrete paths forward for further improvements.",

For a Hamiltonian composed of strictly short-ranged interactions, the Suzuki-Trotter decomposition is the main technique for obtaining such a representation. In [B.~Vanhecke, L.~Vanderstraeten and F.~Verstraete, Physical Review A, L020402 (2021)], an alternative strategy, the cluster expansion, was introduced. This approach naturally preserves internal and lattice symmetries and can more easily be extended to higher-order representations or longer-ranged interactions. We extend the cluster expansion to two-dimensional fermionic systems, and employ it to construct projected entangled-pair operator (PEPO) approximations of Gibbs states. We also discuss and benchmark different truncation schemes for multiplying layers of PEPOs together. Applying the resulting framework to a two-dimensional spinless fermion model with attractive interactions, we resolve a clear phase boundary at finite temperature.",

Even more debated is whether a true phase-coexistence regime survives in the relevant parameter range, or whether apparent inhomogeneity is merely extrinsic. Here we address these questions by moving beyond temperature sweeps and probe charge transport in the time domain. Near $T=T_{\\mathrm{max}}$, we find that the resistance of a model system, a quasi-two-dimensional Mott spin liquid material, exhibits clear random-telegraph switching between discrete levels over long timescales. The statistics of the switching - sharp two-level behavior with thermally activated dwell times - point to a mesoscopic \"current-controlling\" region that dynamically toggles between metallic and insulating states, intermittently opening and closing the dominant conduction channel. This characteristic fluctuating dynamics provides direct evidence for intrinsic metal-insulator coexistence and establishes $T\\sim T_{\\mathrm{max}}$ as the regime of Mott intermittency, where transport is governed by stochastic domain switching rather than quasiparticle decoherence.",

    "abstract": "Temperature has a crucial influence on rubber friction and tire dynamics. The temperature field in a rubber tread block is the sum of the background temperature $T_0({\\bf x},t)$, which varies slowly in time and space, and the flash temperature $ΔT({\\bf x},t)$, which in nonzero only close to the macroasperity contact regions, and which varies rapidly in time often on the millisecond time scale. Here we study the motion of a single tire tread block and how it is influenced by the flash temperature. We also present a theory and experimental results for the size of the macroasperity contact regions. In particular, we show that for a large enough nominal contact area, in most cases the diameter $D$ of the macroasperity contact regions are nearly independent of the elastic modulus and the nominal contact pressure.",

    "abstract": "Ultra-stable glasses prepared from the physical vapor deposition of organic molecules present a very low density of two-level states, the kind of glass defects that determine their peculiar low temperature thermal properties. Numerical simulations suggest that quasi-localized harmonic vibrational modes emerge in the soft regions associated with two-level states. However, the connection between the low frequency vibrational modes and the local structural instabilities of glasses remains unexplained. Here we exploit a recently developed spectrograph for nuclear resonant analysis of inelastic X-ray scattering to probe the density of vibrational states of amorphous thin films of ultra-stable and conventional glasses down to an exceptionally low frequency of $\\sim 70$ GHz. We show that the glass stability does not affect the harmonic vibrational modes at the lowest frequencies, despite a reduction of almost an order of magnitude in the density of two-level states. At the same time, the vibrational modes at higher frequencies, around the boson peak maximum, are extremely sensitive to the glass stability. Although we cannot exclude the possible existence of quasi-localized modes in glasses, we show that their presence is not strictly necessary to describe the measured density of low frequency vibrations. The experimental developments here presented pave the way to the solution to the long-standing debate on the low frequency vibrations in glasses.",

In this work, we present a quantitative theoretical description of the matter-wave dynamics based on a tailored implementation of the self-consistent theory of localization, which incorporates both the spectral and spatial properties of the state prepared in the disorder. We benchmark this theoretical approach against ab initio numerical simulations, and use it to analyze the atom density profiles observed experimentally in the localized, diffusive, and critical regimes. Particular emphasis is placed on the key role of the atomic energy distribution, especially on the distinct contributions of Bose-condensed and thermal atoms to interpret the experimental profiles.

    "abstract": "Ostwald ripening in O/W emulsions in presence of solubilizing micelles is theoretically studied. At small average sizes, the kinetics is predicted to follow the classical Lifshits-Slezov-Wagner cubic law, with the rate proportional to the molecular solubility of the oil in water, as if no micelles were present. At larger particle sizes the kinetics transitions to the Wagner's quadratic law. The crossover point for the kinetics depends on the dynamics of the oil solubilizate-micelle exchange; it is set by the value of the oil atmosphere distribution parameter, kappa, which, somewhat like Debye length, is proportional to the square root of the micellar concentration. It should be noted that in the range when 1/kappa is close to the particle average radius, the ripening kinetics still nearly follows the cubic law, with only moderate deviations; in this case, the micellar effects are experimentally seen not as the deviations from the linearity, but as an apparent increase in the cubic rate. The increase is predicted to be larger in case of nonionic micelles of ethylene oxide type compared to ionic ones.",

    "abstract": "Searching by chemical and structural analogy is one of the most commonly used and successful approaches to materials discovery. However, formulating this task for algorithmic implementation raises the question of how we define similar materials. Methods have been proposed for searching materials space using vectors based on chemical composition and functional fragments in the material. Descriptors for structural similarity have also been proposed. However, the question of how to incorporate and balance structural and compositional similarity measures in a single metric remains open. Here, we adapt methods developed for calculating distances between undirected graphs and apply them to crystalline materials similarity. The Fused Gromov-Wasserstein (FGW) metric uses optimal transport theory to map between two graphs considering a balance of the graph structure and the information present at the nodes of the graph (atoms in crystals). We apply the method to exploring new photovoltaic materials. We demonstrate that FGW is competitive with embeddings from an equivariant graph neural network, trained on $> 10^6$ materials, despite minimal training. We then apply FGW to a discovery campaign to identify materials from the Materials Project database that have not previously been explored as photovoltaics, but have similarities to known high-efficiency materials. After validating predictions with hybrid density functional theory, we identify seven previously unexplored high-efficiency photovoltaic absorber candidates, including Cs$_5$Sb$_8$, which is found to have a predicted SLME of $> 30\\%$ and to be thermodynamically stable. The FGW approach demonstrates the power of strong inductive biases for developing metrics for materials exploration with minimal training data.",

Motivated by the desire for a strongly-coupled description, we employ holography to analyze the formation and stability of a NESS in a Weyl semi-metal induced by an external circularly polarized electric field. A time-periodic steady-state solution is constructed and its stability is determined from the spectrum of out-of-equilibrium quasinormal modes (Floquet exponents). A stable region in the drive parameter space is identified; beyond a critical curve, the Floquet exponents enter the upper half of the complex plane, leading to a superharmonic response. At sufficiently strong driving, chaotic time evolution emerges in the fully nonlinear initial-boundary value problem. The anomaly-induced response of the NESS to an external magnetic field is also computed, and the resulting behavior is related to the previously proposed chiral pumping effect.",

We establish an exact, universal relationship between components of the Drude weight matrix and fundamental thermodynamic quantities (e.g., particle, enthalpy, and entropy densities) for the constituent particles with distinct statistics undergo dynamic coupling. For both models, we further derive analytical approximations of the Drude weight in distinct physical regimes and identify universal scaling laws for the Drude weight near quantum phase transitions.Finally, to connect theory with experiment, we propose and simulate two feasible measurement protocols--a linear potential quench and a bipartitioning setup-verifying that they can reliably extract the Drude weights.

    "abstract": "Large-spin two-dimensional magnets are generally expected to develop conventional long-range order once the dominant exchange scale becomes appreciable. The layered spin-$3/2$ maple-leaf compound Na$_2$Mn$_3$O$_7$ defies this expectation: despite sizable antiferromagnetic interactions and no evident disorder, it exhibits no magnetic ordering and displays two well-separated thermodynamic crossover scales. We show that this behavior originates from a crystallography-driven molecularization of the magnetic degrees of freedom. The low-symmetry structure partitions the Mn sublattice into inequivalent exchange pathways, generating a pronounced hierarchy that nearly isolates antiferromagnetic hexagons. Magnetic correlations therefore develop in two stages: first within individual hexagons at a scale set by the dominant exchange, and only at much lower temperatures do frustrated inter-hexagon couplings attempt to establish coherence across the lattice. While isolated hexagons reproduce the two-step thermodynamic structure, the experimentally relevant temperature scales emerge only once the hexagons are embedded in the frustrated two-dimensional network. The resulting quantum ground state is magnetically disordered, characterized by strong intra-hexagon correlations and rapidly decaying inter-hexagon correlations. These results identify crystallographic inequivalence as a materials-level mechanism for stabilizing molecularized and quantum-disordered states even in large-spin two-dimensional magnets.",

    "abstract": "Halide perovskites have been extensively studied owing to their excellent optoelectronic properties and their unique lattice characteristics, that are very soft and anharmonic. Recent studies indicate the importance of a deep understanding of their surfaces and, in the limit, the properties of low-dimensional structures based on these materials. To investigate the structural and electronic properties of halide perovskite monolayers (i.e., perovskenes), this work uses first-principles simulations. We have studied three different stoichiometries (ABX3, ABX4, and A2BX4) and structural phases for iodide, bromide, and chloride perovskite monolayers. Their thermodynamic behavior was evaluated through the construction of phase diagrams, highlighting the instability of the ABX4 stoichiometry, which was further supported by its mechanical instability. Structurally, the covalent characteristics of the Pb--X bond, in contrast to the Cs--X bonds, induce a strong anisotropy in the Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio along different crystallographic directions, and also account for the lower stiffness observed in the phases where the octahedra are not aligned. The electronic properties are somewhat similar to those of their 3D counterparts, but with a slightly larger band gap; in the monolayers, the band gap increases with halogen electronegativity (I, Br, Cl) and octahedral tilting. Moreover, the non-symmetric ABX3 stoichiometry exhibited a spin splitting due to the internal dipole moment in these layers. Overall, our work lays the groundwork for a deeper understanding of low-dimensional structures based on halide perovskites.",

Although quantum conductance (QC) phenomena have been demonstrated in various metal oxide memristors, achieving reliable and precise control over quantized states remains in its infancy. Here, we demonstrate bidirectional quantum conductance states in multifunctional BiFeO3 (BFO) perovskite memristors integrated with multilayer-graphene contacts, enabling higher-order tunability and revealing the potential of perovskite-2D heterostructures for quantum-engineered memory and computing devices. XPS analysis provides detailed insights into oxygen vacancy dynamics in BFO, whereas first-principles density functional theory calculations clearly reveal a strong localized electric field at the graphene-BFO interface. Our devices exhibit current-controlled higher-order QC transitions facilitated by quantum point contact formation, giving rise to quantized conductance states during both SET and RESET processes. Time-lag correlation maps quantify the stochastic evolution of QC states under dynamic voltage-pulse tuning schemes. Notably, the quantized conductance states effectively emulate synaptic potentiation and depression, enabling precise weight modulation for high-accuracy image and digit recognition in convolutional neural networks. These findings establish perovskite-2D heterostructures as promising candidates for QC-driven resistive switching and demonstrate their potential for developing controllable quantum memristors.",

In this work, we introduce a purification-based framework that systematically characterizes all mixed-state phases in one-dimensional systems with $\\mathbb{Z}_2^σ \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2^τ$ symmetry. By introducing an ancillary $κ$ chain and employing decorated domain-wall constructions, we derive eight purified fixed-point Hamiltonians labeled by topological indices $(μ_{στ},μ_{τκ},μ_{κσ}) \\in \\{\\pm1\\}^3$. Tracing out the ancilla recovers the full structure of mixed-state phases, including symmetric, strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking, average symmetry-protected topological phases, and their nontrivial combinations. Interpolations between the eight fixed points naturally define a three-dimensional phase diagram with a cube geometry. The edges correspond to elementary transitions associated with single topological indices, while the faces host intermediate phases arising from competing domain-wall decorations. Along the edges, we identify a class of critical behavior that connects distinct strong-to-weak symmetry-breaking patterns associated with distinct strong subgroups, highlighting a mechanism unique to mixed-state settings. Large-scale tensor-network simulations reveal a rich phase structure, including pyramid-shaped symmetry-breaking regions and a fully symmetry-broken phase at the cube center.

However, their stability under perturbations remains inadequately understood. In this work, we derive improved lower bounds on the thermalization time of QMBS under local perturbations with strength $λ$. Using both numerical simulations and analytical reasoning, we show that exact QMBS exhibit slow thermalization, with a timescale scaling as $τ\\sim \\mathcal{O}(λ^{-1/d})$ owing to the stabilizing restricted spectrum-generating algebra (RSGA), which is a significant improvement over previous bounds (e.g., $τ\\sim \\mathcal{O}(λ^{-1/(d+1)})$). Counterintuitively, approximate QMBS can thermalize even more slowly under generic perturbations, exhibiting $τ\\sim \\mathcal{O}(λ^{-2})$ scaling due to second-order perturbative effects in the absence of such protective structure. These distinct thermalization behaviors clarify how exact and approximate scars maintain coherence. Our work advances previous findings by establishing a tighter bound on the thermalization time, clarifying when scarred dynamics remain long-lived under weak but generic perturbations.",

Using the Büttiker-Landauer formalism, we analytically obtain the local Hall and Nernst coefficients in the weak-field ballistic regime.

The oscillations originate from the discrete set of skipping orbits that geometrically connect the contacts, with resonances occurring when the angular separation between contacts times the radius of the disk equals an integer number of cyclotron diameters. Unlike conventional quantum oscillations in conductivity, this effect is robust at room temperature and can dominate local thermoelectric signals. This geometric control of ballistic flow provides a platform for studying electron hydrodynamics and engineering phase-coherent devices, with potential applications in sensitive terahertz detectors and thermal management systems.",

The model establishes a direct connection between microscopic relaxation processes and Gilbert damping, and reveals how magnon decay evolves from bulk systems to the monolayer limit. We find that magnon-phonon coupling produces Gilbert damping of comparable magnitude in three- and two-dimensional magnets, with qualitative differences between flexural phonons in free-standing monolayers and three-dimensional phonons in substrate-supported layers. By contrast, non-Gilbert damping due to four-magnon scattering is strongly enhanced in two dimensions, where it becomes independent of spin-orbit coupling. To benchmark the model against real materials, we introduce a numerical approach for computing magnon damping from ab initio-derived spin Hamiltonians. We demonstrate that the central conclusions of the model remain valid for magnons in bulk YIG and in a monolayer of the van der Waals magnetic insulator CrSBr.",

For each model, multiple chain lengths were simulated, spanning a range of $N/N_e = 5$-$50$ entanglements per chain. We observe that in all cases the behavior of $G(t)$, beyond the short-time Rouse regime, is accurately described by $G^0_{\\mathrm{N}}[P(t)]^2$, where the chain-length-independent prefactor $G^0_{\\mathrm{N}}$ denotes the plateau modulus. This correlation is consistent with both double reptation and dynamic tube dilation models of polymer relaxation, although the two models are based on different physical pictures. The double reptation model represents the melt as a transient network in which stress relaxation is governed by the survival probability of pairwise entanglements. The dynamic tube dilation model, however, assumes that the tube of constraints surrounding a polymer chain progressively enlarges as relaxation proceeds. The relation $G(t) = G^0_\\mathrm{N}[P(t)]^2$ can serve as a basis for determining the plateau modulus and the corresponding entanglement length. It also simplifies the modeling of $G(t)$, since an accurate analytical expression for $P(t)$ is sufficient to describe the long-time behavior of $G(t)$. We further compare the simulation data for $P(t)$ and $G(t)$ with theoretical predictions.",

    "abstract": "The position noise spectra of six drums on a single chip were measured on a single cooldown below 1.3 kelvin. Cryostat temperatures as low as 0.7 mK were achieved. The temperature dependence of the resonance frequency and linewidth of the drum modes was analyzed in the framework of the tunneling two level system (TLS) model. Departures of the resonance frequency and the position noise power from the expected logarithmic and linear temperature dependences, respectively, were interpreted as indications of thermal decoupling from the cryostat. This previously unexplored measurement configuration revealed that similar neighboring drums on a single chip may be at different temperatures. At the lowest temperatures, some drums exhibited excess damping that decreased with temperature. The magnitude of the excess damping of the drums was correlated with the thermal coupling of their TLS to the cryostat. In the case of one drum, a temporary increase in its damping coincided with a decrease in its mode temperature. The thermalization of the TLS to the cold finger was independent of pump power, pulse tube state and temperature of the pre-cooling stages of the cryostat. These results reveal an interplay between TLS damping and thermalization of nanomechanics that motivates further theoretical work and may impact efforts to extend the coherence of mechanical resonators.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the interplay between relativistic spin-momentum locking arising from altermagnetism and various forms of inversion symmetry breaking. Depending on the symmetry breaking, this can give rise to Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling (SOC), Weyl-type SOC, or the coexistence of two distinct spin-momentum lockings. We focus on the altermagnetic Ca2RuO4 as a testbed material. Our results reproduce the experimentally observed ground state, which is an A-centered magnetic order with the Neel vector along the b-axis, hosting spin cantings along the a- and c-axes but without weak ferromagnetism. Ca2RuO4 exhibits relativistic spin-momentum locking, with different even-parity wave orders for the three spin components. We interpret the experimental results on doped samples as evidence for a transition from a pure altermagnetic phase to a weak ferromagnetic phase. Under ferroelectric- and antiferroelectric-like distortions, there are no qualitative changes in the non-relativistic spin-momentum locking and in the weak ferromagnetism. However, we observe the rise of the Rashba or Weyl-type SOC. Using numerical and analytical models, we investigate which nodal planes persist when inversion symmetry is broken in the relativistic case. The spin-momentum locking of the other components adopt a p-wave character in the case of Rashba; in contrast, Weyl-type SOC disrupts all nodal planes, leaving only nodal lines. Finally, to simulate a stripe phase with structural distortions along the z-axis, we studied a modulated electric field inducing atomic displacements within one Ca2RuO4 layer. This produces a magnetic phase transition to an exotic altermagnetic state with two non-relativistic spin-momentum lockings hosting weak ferromagnetism. Our research presents a comprehensive analysis of various possible scenarios in altermagnets with breaking of inversion symmetries under relativistic effects",

However, strain induced during mechanical exfoliation and assembly of van der Waals heterostructures may lead to plastic deformations of the hBN surface, injecting dislocation lines between the topmost layer and the underlying film. Since a monolayer of hBN is non-centrosymmetric and exhibits a piezoelectric response to deformation, individual dislocations and, in particular their networks, can generate electrostatic potential modulations in the encapsulated 2D material. Here, we examine scenarios in which the top hBN layer is uniaxially strained and/or twisted, and show how lattice reconstruction into dislocation networks leads to the formation of piezoelectric charge hotspots that effectively behave as charged defects.",

We propose a novel method to detect this elusive order in quantum magnets with an illustration in the spin-1 triangular lattice Mott insulator. By integrating out the phonon degrees of freedom, we obtain a phase diagram with substantially enlarged regions for the spin-nematic and spin-nematic-supersolid phases. We then demonstrate that through the spin-lattice coupling, the emergence of spin nematic order imprints a distinctive signature onto the phonon spectra, providing a clear spectroscopic signature for the quadrupolar order accessible via Raman or inelastic X-ray scattering.

    "abstract": "Chalcogenide perovskites have emerged as promising absorber materials for next-generation photovoltaic devices, yet their experimental realization remains limited by competing phases, structural polymorphism, and synthetic challenges. Here, we present a fully data-driven and experimentally grounded screening and ranking framework to assess the stability and experimental feasibility of chalcogenide perovskites, integrating interpretable analytical descriptors, machine-learning models, and sustainability metrics. Using a curated experimental dataset of halide and chalcogenide compounds, we derive a new tolerance factor via the SISSO (sure independence screening and sparsifying operator) algorithm that more accurately distinguishes perovskite-forming compositions than established tolerance-factor-based screening criteria. This descriptor is combined with generative crystal structure prediction, composition-based bandgap estimation, and machine-learning-based feasibility assessment to systematically explore a wide chemical space of hypothetical chalcogenide perovskites. The resulting candidates are further evaluated using sustainability indicators, enabling multi-objective ranking tailored to both single-junction and tandem photovoltaic architectures. Beyond identifying several promising and previously unexplored chalcogenide perovskites, this work demonstrates a transferable screening strategy for chemically constrained materials spaces that balances optoelectronic performance, experimental viability, and long-term sustainability.",

    "abstract": "Fatigue failure occurs when a solid is subjected to repeated, cyclic loading. Glasses subjected to cyclic to shear deformation have recently been investigated using computer simulations and theoretical models, to characterize and rationalize the dependence of the number of cycles to failure, depending on the properties of the glasses, and the deformation amplitude. The average number of cycles to failure has been observed to diverge as the strain amplitude approaches the so-called fatigue limit from above. In this work, rather than the average times themselves, we investigate by computer simulations the distribution of fatigue failure times, in model glasses subjected to cyclic shear deformation and in an elasto-plastic model. In particular, we observe in atomistic simulations that the standard deviation of the logarithm of failure times are proportional to their mean values, with the proportionality constant decreasing as the system size increases, indicating a sharper distribution of failure times. Using a finite-element-based elasto-plastic model, we observe similar behavior and perform a system-size analysis showing that the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean tends toward zero in the thermodynamic limit. Such distributions, rather than arising solely from the distribution of disorder in the samples that have been subjected to cyclic deformation, appear to arise from the intrinsic stochasticity of the failure process, which we analyze through a stochastic damage accumulation model.",

We investigate nonlinear magnetization dynamics in a thin epitaxial iron film driven by femtosecond laser pulses in regimes of homogeneous precession and propagating magnetostatic spin wave packets. The magnetization precession anharmonicity, the generation of higher-order harmonics, and the dynamical rectification are experimentally demonstrated. The numerical solution of the non-linearized Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation reveals that these effects stem from the asymmetry in the energy potential. This asymmetry is readily achievable when an external magnetic field with a strength comparable to the magnetic anisotropy field is applied close to the hard axis. This work establishes a connection between the geometry of the energy profile and nonlinear responses, paving the way for designing magnonic devices with controlled harmonic generation and nonlinear spin wave interaction.",

    "abstract": "Chemical bonding governs how atoms interact to form compounds, thereby determining their physicochemical properties. Despite being an elusive concept, chemical bonding has led to the development of models and tools to explain and predict the behavior of chemical species. This perspective addresses the adoption of chemical bonding analysis to the study of optoelectronic materials, emphasizing the im-portance of its predictive aspect. After reviewing the evolution of chemical bonding models from the first Lewis formulation to the present day, the perspective discusses material classes and chemical bonding phenomena most relevant for light harvesting and emission. We delve into metal halide perovskites and structurally related materials, given their central role in optoelectronic research. Various aspects of chemical bonding in these materials are surveyed, from the structure-property relationship to the rationalization of their electronic properties through molecular orbital diagrams. Two chemical bonding features are particularly important for optoelectronic materials: the ns2 lone pairs of the cations typically found in these materials (e.g. Pb, Sb, Bi) and the antibonding nature of valence and/or conduction bands. We discuss in depth the models to predict the implications of these two phenomena on optoelectronic properties. We also explore chalcohal-ides, a class of materials whose optoelectronic properties are recently emerging. From the chemical bonding perspective, these materials display intriguing phenomena due to the interplay of various types of chemical bonds. Finally, we discuss our vision on the role of chemical bonding analysis in the future of materials science, including synergies and antitheses with machine learning.",

We investigate the phase diagram by varying the fermion mass and the four-fermion coupling, using the pseudoscalar condensate as an order parameter for the $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ parity symmetry breaking phase. The universality classes of the phase boundaries are identified through the central charge $c$ obtained via scaling analysis of the entanglement entropy. Furthermore, we extract the quantity related to the entanglement spectrum from the converged CTMRG environments, allowing us to distinguish the topological insulator phase and the trivial phase. The resulting phase structure suggests that the Aoki phase is separated from the other phases by critical lines characterized by $c=1/2$, while the critical lines with $c=1$ separate the topological insulating and trivial phases. Our numerical results also indicate that the Aoki phase does not persist in the strong-coupling regime for the single-flavor theory.",

The downfolding procedure yields effective multiband Hubbard models that capture the competition between electron hopping and local Coulomb interactions relevant to the system's low-energy properties. The resulting multiband Hubbard models are solved using matrix product states. Applied to Sr$_2$CuO$_3$, SrBaCuO$_3$, and Ba$_2$CuO$_3$, this purely one-dimensional treatment yields no long-range magnetic order, in contrast to the magnetic ordering observed experimentally. To account for this behavior, we extend the multi-step approach by incorporating interchain couplings through a self-consistent mean-field scheme. This combined approach stabilizes finite staggered magnetizations, providing a consistent description of magnetic order in agreement with experiment. For Sr$_2$CuO$_{3.5}$ and SrCuO$_2$, we also tested an approach proposed for ladder materials, however, we find that these materials are not well suited for this approach due to the small magnitude of the intraladder hopping parameters.",

    "abstract": "We develop a diffusion approximation for systems subject to fast random resetting by small amplitudes. Equivalently, this describes systems with frequent but small catastrophes. We demonstrate the validity of the approximation by computing the stationary distribution and mean first-passage times of simple one-dimensional systems. The approximation captures dynamically induced correlations in multi-particle systems, and it can be used to generalise the conditionally independent and identically distributed structure recently found in systems with full resetting. Finally, we show that resetting can induce cycles and patterns, which can be characterised using the diffusion approximation.",

    "abstract": "Magnetic skyrmions are nanoscale, topologically protected spin textures with exceptional potential for high density data storage and energy efficient computing. Among various skyrmion hosting systems, rare earth transition metal ferrimagnets offer a promising platform due to their tunable magnetic properties and intrinsically low net magnetization. Despite this, the fundamental control of ferrimagnetic skyrmions in single layer films remains unexplored. Here, we demonstrate a viable route for engineering room temperature skyrmions in GdFe single layers through precise control of film thickness (60 to 80 nm). Thickness variation enables the systematic tuning of key magnetic parameters, including perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and saturation magnetization, thereby allowing precise control over skyrmion size and density. Magnetic force microscopy (MFM) reveals a clear thickness dependent evolution of isolated skyrmion characteristics, where skyrmion size decreases while skyrmion density increases with increasing GdFe film thickness, in agreement with micromagnetic simulations. At the same time, magnetotransport measurements show a systematic enhancement in the topological Hall resistivity with thickness, further corroborating the increased skyrmion density observed in MFM. Scanning transmission electron microscopy reveals a compositional gradient across the film thickness, indicative of structural asymmetry and potential inversion symmetry breaking, contributing to the emergence of a bulk Dzyaloshinskii Moriya interaction. Notably, sub 60nm skyrmions with high areal density are stabilized at room temperature. This work provides a viable route to tailor the properties of ferrimagnetic skyrmions in single-layer GdFe films, paving the way for the development of high-density ferrimagnetic skyrmionic devices.",

A large anomalous Hall component is present along the easy-magnetization axis (H|| [0001]), and the Hall resistivity shows very complex temperature- and field-dependence, with a sign reversal at low temperatures. The Hall resistivity exhibits a nonlinear and unusual field-dependence.

    "abstract": "Interfacial engineering enables various emergent effects such as spin reorientations and transport anisotropy. Noncollinear spin textures are essential for realizing many emergent quantum transport phenomena. However, driving such spin structures requires precise control of the interfacial magnetic coupling in complex oxide heterostructures. Here, by utilizing competing exchange interactions at the interface between ferromagnetic metal SrRuO3 and ferromagnetic insulator LaCoO3, we discovered a noncollinear spin configuration in SrRuO3 sublayers. Magnetic stripes were induced by out-of-plane rather than in-plane magnetic fields, indicating strong anisotropy pinning in our superlattices. The observed magneto-transport anisotropy is well explained by our proposed spin configurations, accounting for contributions from both bulk and interface of the SrRuO3 layers. More interestingly, magnetic skymionic textures were absent even at high magnetic fields. The interfacial exchange interaction overwhelms the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) that stabilizes skyrmions, featuring a higher exchange coupling energy than that for the topological spin textures. Our work highlights the potential of interfacial engineering in tuning the spintronic properties by designing proper interfacial interactions.",

    "abstract": "Patterned two-dimensional (2D) magnetic nanostructures constitute geometry-engineered spin systems in which exchange, anisotropy, dipolar coupling, and finite-size effects operate on comparable energy scales. Spatial modulation of continuous magnetic films produces confinement-driven critical behavior, compensation phenomena, metastable switching pathways, and topologically non-trivial textures such as vortices and skyrmions. Computational modeling plays a central role in resolving this complexity, enabling quantitative construction of thermodynamic phase diagrams and analysis of geometry-dependent stability regimes. This review synthesizes theoretical and numerical frameworks for patterned 2D magnetism, including classical spin models, stochastic spin dynamics, rare-event methods, and multiscale parameterization informed by first-principles calculations. Representative systems-nanodot and antidot arrays, artificial spin-ice lattices, exchange-modulated heterostructures, and patterned van der Waals magnets- illustrate how geometry functions as an effective thermodynamic control parameter. Emerging directions in nonequilibrium modeling, multiphysics coupling, and scalable data-centric workflows are discussed in the context of predictive phase mapping. Patterned 2D magnetism thus exemplifies the convergence of geometry-controlled materials engineering and computational statistical physics, with phase stability and controlled spin textures at the core of next-generation spintronic architectures.",

    "abstract": "Solid-state refrigeration technologies, represented by electrocaloric effect (ECE), are renowned for zero global-warming-potential and high cooling efficiency. Synergistically achieving high electrocaloric effect (ΔT) and wide temperature span (ΔTspan) for EC materials takes a leapfrog toward practical cooling applications, typical for integrated circuits. Guided by phase-field simulation, Ba(Ti, Hf)O3 dubbed as a polar wrench, establishes polar frustration by setting up local stress field and manipulating octahedral oxygen tilt (OOT) in NaNbO3-based relaxor. The resultant P4bm framework entails short-range and highly-polar ferrodistortive nanodomains, i.e., the abundant highly-polar nanodomains facilitate to increase entropy change and robust OOT enables to impede thermal perturbations. Consequently, a large ΔT of 0.85 K and 0.70 K with an ultrawide ΔTspan of 118 K and 130 K is obtained, contributing to an ultrahigh figure of merit of > 90 K2 in NaNbO3-Ba(Ti, Hf)O3, significantly outperforms its counterparts. The local structure responsible for robust EC performances are decrypted through 2D information from atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscope, 3D big-box model constructed from neutron total scattering and DFT calculations. These findings highlight that polar frustration strategy in ferrodistortive relaxor enables to pioneer emergent EC performances, and also unearth potential entropy-change-based ferroelectric and ferromagnetic materials beyond.",

Here, a series of high-entropy perovskite OTMs based on La0.5Sr0.5CoO3 were designed and synthesized by the simple sol-gel method. The impact of varying doping ratios on the structure, surface morphology, oxygen permeability, and stability of these high-entropy OTMs was thoroughly examined. At 950 °C, the optimal composition, La0.25Sr0.25Gd0.2Nd0.2Pr0.1CoO3, achieved oxygen permeation fluxes of 1.62 mL min-1 cm-2 under air/He gradient and 1.46 mL min-1 cm-2 under air/CO2, respectively. Remarkably, all high-entropy OTMs demonstrated stable operation for over 100 h in a pure CO2 environment without a significant decline in performance. This finding paves a new way to enhance the structural and oxygen permeation stability of OTMs, and further promotes the application of OTMs in oxy-fuel combustion technologies aimed at improving CO2 capture and storage efficiency.",

However, the ultrafast, nanoscale carrier dynamics at these interfaces, crucial for device performance, have remained experimentally elusive. Here, we introduce optical pump-probe time-resolved atomic force microscopy to directly visualize, in real space, the nanosecond-scale modulation of the Schottky barrier potential at a van der Waals junction formed by point contact between WSe2 and a PtIr tip. Complementary analyses using transient absorption spectroscopy and light-modulated current-voltage characteristics together with model simulations reveal that time-resolved currents originate from the concerted temporal evolution of photoexcited carriers and the subsequent barrier response, processes that also define the rate-limiting steps of the photocurrent. Our results uncover the essential interfacial dynamics that underpin TMDC-based photodetectors and photovoltaic elements, while establishing a new measurement paradigm that complements and extends existing spectroscopic techniques. This approach provides direct access to nonequilibrium processes hidden at nanoscale interfaces, offering a powerful route to rational design of high-performance optoelectronic devices.",

We implement this mechanism in a lattice-matched KV2Se2O/Bi2O2Se/KV2Se2O magnetic tunnel junction, which achieves a robust half-metallic transport regime. The symmetry-protected spectral gap in the parallel/anti-parallel configuration ensures a high tunneling magnetoresistance ratio, resulting in substantial tunneling magnetoresistance, robust thermally driven spin filtering, and spin Seebeck effect at room temperature. These findings provide a path of altermagnetic heterostructures as a high-performance platform for scalable, field-free, and thermally stable spin logic.",

In practical applications, hydrogels operate in aqueous environments containing dissolved ionic species, where swelling and elastic behaviour depend sensitively on ionic conditions. In this study, an experimental setup is developed to measure elastic responses of granular hydrogels under wet conditions. This setup directly observes liquid bridges formation and its evolution during compression. Our results show that neglecting capillary contributions leads to a systematic underestimation of the Young's modulus of hydrogels. Such an underestimation due to the capillary interaction increases as the sample size or its intrinsic stiffness decreases. In addition to the swelling ratio, the tested samples were also prepared under controlled salinity levels. The experimentally observed dependence of stiffness on swelling and salinity conditions is well captured by a modified constitutive model. The development of this study offers a robust testing protocol for measuring elastic properties of hydrogels under various environmental conditions.",

Degradation in SrFeO3 manifests mainly as a crossover from metallic to insulating behavior.

We further demonstrate that high quality SrFeO3 thin films can be stabilized long-term by combining a nanoscale band insulator capping layer with an ex situ ozone anneal. We show that this produces a nearly-pristine cation sublattice and preserves metallicity for at least several weeks. These results establish a reliable pathway for producing chemically stable SrFeO3 thin films, enabling reproducible studies of its unusual helimagnetism.",

This extension gives rise to unique topological features such as winding-number quantization, discontinuous phase-slip transitions, and hysteretic and non-reciprocal phase dynamics. We further extend the analysis to the quantum regime, where we find a counterintuitive result: the breakdown of winding-number quantization. This arises from the superposition of different winding-number states in a closed-space Thouless pump. Moreover, hysteretic dynamics, once eliminated in quantum adiabatic approximation, is recovered in non-adiabatic calculations, as the superposition of two Floquet states with different PT eigenvalues becomes the quantum counterpart of phase trajectory.",

We introduce a new toolkit, the Simulator Collection for Atomic-to-Continuum Scales (SCACS), which uses a graph neural network to predict SPTC on large atomic structures, coarse-grain these fields into anisotropic conductivity tensors, and embeds them into the heat-flow FE equation with a customized, anisotropy-aware adaptive mesh refinement scheme. Applied to silicon nanostructures, the resulting FE models act as representative volume elements, reproduce bulk conductivities, and capture interfacial and defect-driven anisotropy while maintaining thermodynamic consistency. Additionally, SCACS predicts experimental conductance trends and fields.

    "abstract": "Nanofluidic ionic transistors typically require gate voltages above 1 V and operate only at sub millimolar ionic strengths, limiting their biocompatible applications. We demonstrate ionic transistors consisting of single sub 10 nm nanopores drilled in van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures with internal gate electrodes made of few layer graphene. These devices deliver up to 10fold current modulation at gate voltages as low as 0.3 V in 10 mM KCl, and 2fold modulation at near physiological 100 mM KCl. Baseline conductance with no gate shows surface charge dominated transport below 100 mM KCl consistent with negatively charged hBN walls and 5 nm opening of the pores. The surface charge and the electrochemical asymmetry introduced by the three electrode configuration govern the device behavior: negative gate voltage (VG) enriches ionic concentrations and enhances current, whereas positive VG induces a local depletion zone that suppresses transport. The current modulation by VG is dependent on the polarity of the transmembrane potential and leads to ion current rectification. Molecular dynamics simulations of a nanopore in a hBN graphene hBN stack reveal confinement and surface charge dependent suppression of relative permittivity of interfacial water. Continuum modeling with radially varying interfacial water permittivity reproduces the asymmetric IV characteristics and explains how the embedded gate sculpts local potential and ion concentrations. By enabling sub 0.5 V control of ionic transport at up to 100 mM salt concentrations, these devices address a key barrier in nanofluidics and open the pathway to low power ionic circuits and biosensing.",

    "abstract": "We report an ambient-pressure Dirac electron (DE) state in a new organic conductor, $α$-(BETS)$_2$AuCl$_2$ (BETS = bis(ethylenedithio)tetraselenafulvalene). This salt exhibits characteristic transport properties, including large positive in-plane and anomalous negative interlayer magnetoresistance. These signatures closely resemble the high-pressure DE states of $α$-(ET)$_2$I$_3$ (ET = bis(ethylenedithio)tetrathiafulvalene). First-principles calculations including spin-orbit coupling identify the electronic state as a quasi-three-dimensional massive Dirac semimetal with residual Fermi pockets. This discovery provides a valuable platform for exploring bulk Dirac fermions without the complexity of high-pressure measurements.",

    "abstract": "Phonon modes within pristine crystalline resonators now routinely reach the quantum ground state. Such systems are attractive for quantum information science applications, as advanced fabrication and processing can enable relatively long quantum coherence times, and precision control can be realized through optical, electrical, or qubit coupling. In many state-of-the-art systems, the phonon lifetime is limited by disorder. In particular, native oxides or damaged `dead layers' at surfaces can host two-level tunneling states that lead to a particularly problematic form of dissipation that increases at lower temperatures. As mechanical losses are driven down in systems such as micro-fabricated bulk acoustic wave resonators, tunneling states are expected to emerge as the dominant mechanism for phonon decoherence. A quantitative description of these mesoscopic systems therefore requires a framework that captures interactions between a selected phonon mode and a large ensemble of TLS. Here, we derive a quantum master equation for this coupled system, permitting the phonon decoherence produced by two-level tunneling states to be calculated. As an example, we estimate the lifetime of a variety of quantum states within quartz micro-resonators hosting a thin surface layer of tunneling states. We find that the phonon coherence time is maximized at low temperatures, in spite of increased mechanical dissipation, and that phonon-TLS coupling can be reduced for modes with strain nodes at the surfaces.",

They can be combined using thin films and in-plane magnetic fields, an approach that enabled the pursuit of Majorana zero modes, Kitaev chains, and Andreev spin qubits (ASQs), but remains challenging for materials with small in-plane g-factors. Here we show that granular aluminum (grAl), composed of nanometer-scale aluminum grains embedded in an amorphous oxide matrix, can overcome this limitation. By depositing grAl on Ge/SiGe heterostructures, we induce a hard superconducting gap with BCS peaks at 305 $μ$eV and magnetic-field resilience for both the in-plane and out-of-plane directions, allowing Zeeman splitting of Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states beyond 50 $μ$eV (12 GHz).

Recent research into spin qubits in Ge/SiGe heterostructures has focused on increasing the thickness of the SiGe capping layer, reporting improvements in the electrostatic noise levels.

Here, we study a Ge/SiGe heterostructure with a thin SiGe cap $d \\approx 4\\ \\mathrm{nm}$ and investigate its viability to host low-noise quantum dots.

    "abstract": "Demonstrating genuine many-body quantum coherence in large-scale quantum processors remains a central challenge for near-term quantum technologies. Recent experiments on D-Wave quantum annealers have investigated quenches of Ising chains and observed defect densities that show Kibble-Zurek scaling, consistent with coherent quantum dynamics. However, identical scaling can arise from classical or thermal processes. Here we propose the use of many-body coherent oscillations (MBCO) as a diagnostic for the identification of system-wide coherence in analog quantum simulators. Solving the time-dependent Schrodinger equation, we show that quenches of a staggered one-dimensional Ising chain across a quantum critical point produce oscillatory signatures in defect observables. We implement this model on the D-Wave Advantage quantum annealer. Using fast-anneal protocols, we find that, although defect densities follow Kibble-Zurek scaling, the expected oscillatory behavior is absent. We demonstrate that static disorder associated with individual qubits is not likely responsible for the absence of MBCO. Modest modifications to annealing schedules can dramatically enhance oscillation visibility. This work gives a general roadmap for the search for quantum coherence in noisy, large-scale quantum platforms.",

In particular, while adiabatic growth of the supermassive black hole Sgr A$^\\ast$ at the Galactic Center (GC) can induce a 'spike' in central DM density, the existence of such a spike is still under debate. Here we present new constraints on the spike slope $γ_{\\rm sp}$ using conventional DM indirect detection searches. We first recast existing photon and neutrino line searches, which include the contribution from the GC region, into constraints on the thermally-averaged DM annihilation cross section $\\langleσv\\rangle$ in the presence of a DM spike. We then derive new bounds on the spike profile for a generic Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) DM scenario, where the thermal freeze-out mechanism fixes the annihilation cross-section at $\\langleσv\\rangle\\sim (2-3) \\times 10^{-26}~{\\rm cm}^3~{\\rm s}^{-1}$. We find that for DM annihilation to photons, constraints from Fermi-LAT and MAGIC rule out spike profiles at the GC for a broad range of WIMP DM masses from 10 GeV to 100 TeV. Our result holds even if the photon channel constitutes only $1\\%$ of the total annihilation rate. For the neutrino channel, we use the IceCube data to constrain the existence of an extremely steep spike in the $\\mathscr{O}(1-10)$ TeV DM mass range.

For constant fields, we derive exact probabilities and identify a perturbative plateau regime where photon survival scales as quartic order of magnetic field, isolating the four-point magnetic correlation as a sensitive probe of non-Gaussianity. For Gaussian stochastic fields, we obtain--for the first time--analytical formulas for non-exponential-decay components in the strong-attenuation regime. Contrary to the widely used domain-like model, photon survival is suppressed by 4-6 orders of magnitude, while both conversion and survival probabilities exhibit distinct multi-peak structures from mass-equal resonance, stochastic resonance, and EBL attenuation. Extending to non-Gaussian fields, we show that non-Gaussianity can enhance photon survival by several orders of magnitude relative to the Gaussian case, potentially explaining the unexpectedly VHE photon event observed by LHAASO. Our results demonstrate that stochastic magnetic fields cannot be reduced to domain-like coherence without losing essential physics, and that VHE gamma-ray spectra encode observable information about both the power spectrum and non-Gaussian structure of intergalactic magnetic fields--critical as next-generation observatories push toward PeV sensitivities.",

This mixed phase simultaneously contains regions of both confining and deconfining states in thermal equilibrium, separated by a spatial transition. The position of the boundary between the two phases is determined by the local critical temperature. We calculate the critical temperature of the local transition as a function of angular velocity and radius for a full (imaginary) rotating system and within a local thermalization approximation, and find an excellent agreement between these approaches. An analytic continuation of the results to the domain of real angular frequencies indicates that the confinement phase localizes at the periphery of the rotating system and the deconfinement phase appears closer to the rotation axis. We argue that the anisotropy of the gluon action in the curved co-rotating background can quantitatively explain the remarkable property that the spatial structure of this inhomogeneous phase disobeys the picture based on a straightforward implementation of the Tolman-Ehrenfest law. We also perform the first lattice simulation of rotating $N_f=2$ QCD which confirms that a similar picture is expected for theory with dynamical quarks.",

The modular transformation properties of the Yukawa couplings under $A_4$ symmetry lead to a highly constrained neutrino mass matrix with a distinctive flavor structure. After presenting the general theoretical framework, we perform a systematic numerical analysis of neutrino phenomenology by restricting the modulus parameter $τ$ to the fundamental domain and scanning the allowed parameter space. We identify regions consistent with current neutrino oscillation data at the $3σ$ level and obtain predictions for currently unknown observables, including the absolute neutrino mass scale and leptonic CP-violating phases. We further examine the implications for neutrinoless double beta decay, highlighting testable signatures in upcoming precision oscillation and rare-process experiments.

    "abstract": "We investigate Bogomolnyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) topological configurations in the $CP^1$ model minimally coupled to a Maxwell gauge field. Starting from the nonlinear $O(3)$ sigma model, we explicitly construct its classical mapping to the $CP^1$ formulation, emphasizing the emergence of a local $U(1)$ gauge symmetry intrinsically linked to the Fubini-Study target-space geometry. Focusing on the static sector, we analyze magnetized BPS lump configurations. By examining the topological boundary conditions, we show that the magnetic flux is quantized and fully determined by the asymptotic behavior of the gauge field. Within the BPS framework, we identify the specific self-interaction potential required for the existence of self-dual configurations. A detailed analysis of the asymptotic behavior, both near the lump core and at spatial infinity, demonstrates that finite-energy solutions necessarily correspond to lump-like BPS configurations in the $CP^1$ target space, with the scalar field vanishing asymptotically. The resulting BPS equations are solved numerically, and the main physical properties of the solutions are presented. We find that these configurations are regular, magnetically localized, and energetically stable, with their internal structure rigidly controlled by the geometry of the $CP^1$ target space. In contrast to Abelian Higgs vortices, the configurations discussed here do not rely on spontaneous symmetry breaking but arise purely from the geometry of the $CP^1$ target space.",

    "abstract": "The topology of the ground state of QCD manifests itself through the dependence of its potential energy density on the CP-violating angle $Θ$. This is computed in the present note within a three-flavor linear meson model. It is shown that the isospin symmetry breaking condensate leads to a 5\\% shift in the scale of topological fluctuations, due to which a value emerges in close agreement with lattice QCD determinations. Transparent analytical computation makes explicit the physical content of each step significantly correcting the starting crude estimate of topological susceptibility and eventually achieving the quite accurate final result. This clear physical interpretation lends also a certain pedagogical value to the proposed treatment.",

In this framework, conventional QCD sum rules are recast as an inverse problem, allowing for the direct reconstruction of hadronic spectral densities from first principles without invoking phenomenological continuum parametrizations or quark-hadron duality assumptions. We compute the masses and decay constants of conventional $B_c$ mesons with quantum numbers $J^P = 0^-$, $1^-$, $0^+$, and $1^+$. The obtained results are in close agreement with available experimental measurements and are consistent with predictions from various theoretical and phenomenological approaches.

The calculations are performed for central Au+Au collisions at energies $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 3 -- 19.6 GeV. These $V_4$ indicate optimal collision-energy ranges for realizing macroscopic high baryon-density matter. It is found that the 3FD four-volumes noticeably exceed those in the JAM, which indicates a stronger baryon stopping in the 3FD model as compared to that JAM. It is argued that this difference in the baryon stopping correlates with stiffness of the EoS implemented in these models. Contrary to JAM, the four-volume, where a baryon density ($n_B$) exceeds three times the normal nuclear density ($n_0$), does not exhibit a maximum as a function of $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$. It decreases monotonically with increasing $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$, remaining at a fairly macroscopic level (i.e. $V_4\\geq 5.5^4$ fm$^4$/c). For higher baryon densities, $V_4$ exhibits maxima in its dependence on $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$. The optimal energy range for densities $n_B/n_0>$ 4 is located at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=$ 3.2--8 GeV.

We study its sensitivity to each of 17 model parameters in the context of 4 different models for particlization when switching from the hydro description to the kinetic theory afterburner. We find that the strongest sensitivity is to parameters relating to bulk viscosity, free-streaming time, and the $\\texttt{T$_\\mathrm{R}$ENTo}$ nucleon width parameter $w$. However, we find that the model generally has surprisingly little flexibility in describing the scaled spectrum observable, despite the large number of parameters.   Within this small range of parameter dependence, we further find significant tension in a simultaneous description of momentum-integrated observables. In particular, while the mean transverse momentum prefers a large value of the nucleon width parameter $w$, a small value is required to obtain scaled spectra that are consistent with experimental measurements. We speculate on the origin of these model tensions and possible missing physics in the commonly-used $\\texttt{T$_\\mathrm{R}$ENTo}$+free streaming+hydro+afterburner simulation model.",

Consistency with the ACT data is achieved by considering a fractional shift-symmetric Kaehler potential which includes two free parameters (p,N) constrained in the ranges 1.355<p<6.7 and 6x10^-5<N<0.7. An explanation of the mu term of the MSSM is also provided, under the condition that a related parameter in the superpotential is somewhat small.

    "abstract": "This paper investigates the physical and kinematic properties of dust-rich regions in a small sample of group-centered elliptical galaxies, emphasizing their connection with the hot X-ray emitting gas and detailed dust grain characteristics. Comprehensive multi-wavelength data, including H-alpha and CO emission detected by MUSE and ALMA, demonstrate the presence of dust clouds embedded within complex, hot X-ray atmospheres shaped by AGN feedback. X-ray images show bubbles and cavities surrounded by bright rims. We find that dust regions containing molecular gas traced by CO are preferentially located at the rims of these X-ray cavities, suggesting that AGN-driven outflows enhance the condensation of cold, dusty gas at these compressive interfaces. Kinematic measurements indicate that molecular and ionized gas phases are dynamically and spatially linked, supporting the framework of a multiphase medium arising from the top-down condensation rain in the hot plasma and related chaotic cold accretion. Crucially, spatial variations in the total-to-selective extinction ratio Rv show that regions where dust, CO, and H-alpha emission coincide exhibit notably smaller Rv values, implying steeper extinction curves and the predominance of smaller or less evolved dust grains within these mixed-phase environments. This contrasts with larger Rv values found elsewhere in the dust clouds, suggesting grain growth or survival mechanisms within shielded cold gas.",

    "abstract": "Cosmic strings are topological defects arising in a variety of cosmological scenarios, as the Universe undergoes symmetry-breaking phase transitions, whose discovery would offer valuable insight into the high-energy physics that shaped the early Universe. To interpret such a detection, robust theoretical models are essential. The Velocity-dependent One-Scale (VOS) model is particularly prominent: it self-consistently treats the network as a thermodynamic system, characterizing its key properties, and predicting its large-scale evolution. This has recently been extended to include superconducting cosmic strings, which carry additional degrees of freedom, giving rise to the Charge-Velocity dependent One-Scale (CVOS) model. One limitation of the latter model is that it only included loss mechanisms for the charge and current. Here, we extend this model by phenomenologically including a possible energy source mechanism, specifically by allowing current-carrying strings interactions with an external magnetic field. We discuss how this coupling impacts the network's evolution, present and classify the physically allowed scaling solutions for this extended CVOS model, and comment on the different impacts of the external magnetic field on the evolution of the network's charge and current. Under our modeling assumptions, one of the ten physically plausible scaling solution enables the network to gain energy by this mechanism.",

We study kinematic distributions for signal and backgrounds, including hadronization and detector effects, and suggest a set of cuts to minimize backgrounds. In the mass range considered, we find that the EIC with muon detection capabilities and an integrated luminosity of $100~\\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ can reach sensitivities comparable to the strongest direct (LHC) and indirect constraints, and is especially relevant in the $ν$SMEFT framework beyond dimension four.

Evaluating these in the deep Euclidean momentum region enables their expression in terms of local operators. Using contour-integration techniques, we relate these local operators, after vacuum subtraction, to the physical transport coefficients that arise along a branch cut, close to light-like dispersion.

    "abstract": "Assuming that dark matter is an ultralight pseudoscalar particle which couples to electromagnetism like an axion (an ALP), we demonstrate that the coupling of the cosmological magnetic field produced by the ALP field oscillations to the primordial dark matter fluctuations yields a spectrum of gauge field fluctuations which can produce a sufficient flux of Lyman-Werner photons to enable the Direct Collapse Black Hole formation scenario. The induced flux is consistent with the bounds on the excess flux of radio photons from ARCADE2 and EDGES measurements.",

    "abstract": "Hyperon physics offers a distinctive laboratory for probing the intensity frontier and searching for physics beyond the Standard Model. This review summarizes recent results from the BESIII experiment, including pioneering studies of dark baryons, massless BSM particles, and invisible decay modes, together with investigations of baryon- and lepton-number violation. A central highlight is the determination of the $Λ$ electric dipole moment using quantum-entangled hyperon-antihyperon pairs, achieving a sensitivity three orders of magnitude beyond previous limits. These measurements provide world-leading constraints on new physics scenarios and establish a robust foundation for next-generation precision studies. By integrating experimental progress with theoretical developments and future facility prospects, this review emphasizes the critical role of hyperon probes in testing the fundamental laws of nature.",

Within the Starobinsky inflationary model, we compute and compare the scalar spectral index, its running, and the running of the running arising from different choices of the initial vacuum state. We further examine the energy scales associated with $α$-vacua and argue that, for any number of extra spatial dimensions, the relevant scale can be truncated at the Hubble scale, $\\sim$$\\mathcal{O}(10^{13})\\,\\mathrm{GeV}$, without conflict with current Cavendish-type experimental bounds on sub-millimeter gravity ($\\sim$$250\\,μ\\mathrm{m}$).

This imprint reflects the stochasticity in the partition of the primary energy among secondary particles in the first interaction. We show that these fluctuations can be accessed through a probabilistic description that isolates sensitivity to hadronic physics in the initial collision, while treating the subsequent shower development as effectively universal. The uncertainties resulting from this universality are smaller than the spread among current hadronic interaction models and comparable to current experimental uncertainties. Consequently, the joint observable space defined by these two quantities provides a new probe of hadron production in kinematic regimes far beyond the reach of human-made accelerators.",

The reconstructed model functions are then parametrized and kept fixed across thermodynamic states. Next, viewing the EMD sector as an effective description of pure Yang--Mills theory, we fix its parameters by fitting the $μ_B=0$ lattice pure-glue EoS using a hybrid optimization strategy. Finally, we go beyond the probe limit and solve the coupled EMD$+$KKSS equations with back-reaction, using the pure-glue-calibrated EMD sector as a fixed input and varying the KKSS couplings to compare with the $μ_B=0$ two-flavor lattice EoS. We find a visible mismatch and a high-temperature behavior in which the back-reacted dimensionless ratios approach a nearly $β_1$-insensitive plateau close to the pure-glue baseline, providing a simple structural diagnostic for the present flavor-sector truncation.",

The basic fields are formulated in terms of two-component spin-tensors in (A)dS space where the tracelessness conditions are automatically fulfilled. The mass shell of partially massless fields is reformulated in terms of constraints on Fock space vectors including the second-class constraints. A conversion procedure for transforming second-class constraints into first-class ones is developed, allowing one to construct a Hermitian and nilpotent BRST charge in the Fock space under consideration. It is proven that the hermiticity and nilpotency restrict the conditions on the theory parameters, which are fulfilled only in dS space. The hermiticity of the BRST charge is incompatible with AdS space. The gauge invariant Lagrangian is constructed on the basis of the BRST charge, and for spin $s$ and depth $t$ the allowed states in the Lagrangian include only $(s-t)$ Stückelberg fields. Their exclusion leads to gauge transformations of degree $(s-t)$ for the physical fields. The Lagrangian equations of motion exactly reproduce the mass shell conditions. The Lagrangian in terms of conventional spin-tensor fields is also presented.",

To this end, we first derive the equations of motion for both fields on the aforementioned background; these equations are then reformulated uniformly into the Teukolsky equation. Since the Teukolsky equation in asymptotically de Sitter spacetimes can be mapped into the Heun equation, we are able to solve quasinormal spectra by employing the Heun function method, not only for photon sphere modes but also for de Sitter and near-extremal modes. We analyze the spectra of all three types for both fields and, in particular, ascertain the effects of the global monopole. In the near-extremal regime, we find that the presence of a global monopole, on the one hand, leaves the strong cosmic censorship conjecture unaffected for scalar perturbations, while on the other hand, it enhance the violation of strong cosmic censorship for Dirac perturbations. Furthermore, we identify that the impact of the global monopole on both the spectra and the strong cosmic censorship is achieved by a shift in the modified multipole number. Our work demonstrates that the Heun function method is an efficient and robust approach for exploring the interaction between asymptotically de Sitter black holes and perturbing fields.",

We establish a universal entropy--extremality relation that provides thermodynamic evidence for the WGC independently of $f_{R_0}$ and $R_0$. Photon sphere analysis from both geodesic and topological perspectives confirms the simultaneous compatibility of the WGC and WCCC, with the Euler--Heisenberg coupling restoring photon spheres in the naked singularity regime. Gravitational lensing in the strong- and weak-deflection limits reveals that the photon sphere radius is independent of the cosmological background while the critical impact parameter nearly doubles in de Sitter.

The corresponding particle dynamics then acquires an additional term in the geodesic equation that takes the form of a fixed external force $F_{\\text{NC}}^μ= -\\frac{1}{2} g^{μν}\\partial_νM^2(x)$, sourced entirely by the quantum nature of spacetime. We compute this effective mass perturbatively up to fourth order in the noncommutativity parameter for a general metric, proving that all odd-order corrections vanish identically.

The analysis extends the previously considered WKB expansion of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation to modified gravity theories, up to second order. We apply the general method for homogeneous and isotropic FLRW universes, with zero and positive spatial curvature, for any $f(R)$ model. For the flat case we obtain analytic expressions for the transition probabilities for any model if we assume a constant Ricci scalar; this assumption has been considered in previous studies, in the Euclidean approach, from symmetry arguments. On the other hand, we also obtain explicit solutions without this assumption for power-law $f(R)=R^{1+n}$ models. Moreover, in the positive curvature scenario, we obtain that the assumption of a constant Ricci scalar is not consistent, but we are able to find analytical solutions in approximated regimes. In all cases we have found that the general behavior of the probabilities already found for Einstein Gravity is preserved, including the prediction of a non-singular initial state due to quantum corrections, even though the probabilities increase or decrease in a model dependent way.",

    "abstract": "In this letter, we develop a unified semiclassical framework for the thermodynamics and quantization of the Reissner--Nordström (RN) black hole (BH) based on the Misner--Sharp--Hernandez (MSH) mass. Treating the quasi-local horizon energies as the relevant thermodynamic variables, we formulate a horizon-by-horizon first law and Smarr relation. Using a reduced phase-space quantization, we obtain a discrete MSH mass spectrum for both horizons, which reproduces the minimal entropy spacing. Quantum transitions between adjacent levels yield Planck-scale corrections to the Hawking temperatures and a universal logarithmic contribution to the entropy, consistent with independent approaches to quantum gravity. We encode these corrections into a quantum-deformed RN geometry via a simple multiplicative factor that preserves the classical horizon positions while reproducing the corrected surface gravities. The associated effective stress tensor behaves as a conserved vacuum-polarization source with characteristic $r^{-4}$ falloff and a small trace, providing a compact representation of semiclassical backreaction. The deformation slightly lowers both horizon temperatures, weakens the inner-horizon instability, and induces tiny shifts in photon-sphere and shadow observables for macroscopic BHs.",

Starting from the pseudo-Lagrangian, we construct parent actions for all higher gradient dual fields that are associated with the three-form, the six-form, and the dual graviton. We show that the resulting Euler-Lagrange equations constrain the Stueckelberg fields to be pure curls, ensuring that the higher duals propagate the same physical degrees of freedom as the original supergravity fields.

    "abstract": "Doubly Special Relativity (DSR) augments special relativity by introducing, alongside the invariant speed of light $c$, a second observer-independent scale typically associated with the Planck regime. At the level of effective wave equations this principle manifests itself through deformed dispersion relations and energy-dependent spatial operators. Here we quantify such effects in a prototypical exactly solvable bound-state problem: the three-dimensional Klein--Gordon oscillator generated by a non-minimal momentum coupling that yields isotropic harmonic confinement while preserving rotational symmetry. We analyze two standard DSR realizations (Amelino--Camelia and Magueijo--Smolin, parametrized by an invariant energy scale $k$) as well as a generalized DSR framework based on a first-order expansion in the Planck length $l_p$. After stationary reduction and separation in spherical coordinates, the eigenfunctions retain the generalized-Laguerre and spherical-harmonic structure of the undeformed oscillator, whereas DSR deforms the algebraic quantization condition that relates the principal oscillator number $N=2n+\\ell\\in\\mathbb{N}_0$ to the relativistic energy. Closed-form spectra are obtained for the standard DSR cases, and perturbative Planck-suppressed shifts are derived for the generalized model. In all realizations the deformation induces branch-dependent shifts of both positive- and negative-energy solutions, which increase with excitation and vanish smoothly in the limits $k\\to\\infty$ or $l_p\\to0$. The main goal of this paper is to extract analytic spectra and Planck-suppressed shifts that enable a direct comparison between different DSR prescriptions in a fully three-dimensional setting.",

    "abstract": "In this dissertation, we study various aspects of type IIB string theory compactified on freely acting orbifolds. We focus particularly on asymmetric orbifolds, which are examples of non-geometric string compactifications and constitute an intriguing corner in the string landscape. We describe the orbifolds using two complementary approaches; the duality twists and the lattice approach. First, we discuss the general construction of freely acting (asymmetric) orbifolds, focusing on the closed string sector. Afterwards, we present explicit examples of orbifolds preserving $\\mathcal{N} = 6,4,2$ or $0$ supersymmetry in five dimensions and we demonstrate the connection between freely acting orbifolds and Scherk-Schwarz reductions by matching the lightest untwisted orbifold states with those arising form the effective supergravity theory. Regarding the orbifold twisted sectors, we show that at special points in the moduli space, generically massive states can become massless. Furthermore, we show that the spectrum of non-supersymmetric orbifolds can become tachyon-free away from special loci in the moduli space. Next, we turn our attention to the orbifold moduli space, and we focus on orbifolds preserving $\\mathcal{N} = 2$ supersymmetry in five dimensions, for which we determine the classical hypermultiplet and vector multiplet moduli spaces. Moreover, by constructing dual orbifold pairs, we argue that no quantum corrections to the metric on the vector multiplet moduli space arise. Then, we discuss aspects of the swampland program in the context of freely acting asymmetric orbifolds and we verify that the swampland distance conjecture is valid in the non-geometric compactifications of string theory studied in this thesis. Finally, we focus on the D-brane spectrum of freely acting orbifolds and we determine the conditions under which the various D-branes survive the orbifolding.",

As a step towards this goal, we consider the massive Thirring and Gross--Neveu models with arbitrary number of fermion flavors, $N_f$, discretized on a spatial one-dimensional lattice of size $L$ in the Hamiltonian formulation. We compute the gate complexity using the higher-order product formula and using block-encoding/qubitization and quantum singular value transformations in the limit of large $N_f$ and $L$. We also prepare the ground states of both models with excellent fidelity for system sizes up to 20 qubits with $N_f = 1,2,3,4$ using the adaptive-variational quantum imaginary time algorithm. In addition, we also classify the dynamical Lie algebras of these relativistic fermionic models and show that they belong to the same isomorphism class.

One can define a subregion by specifying the value of the dilaton at the boundary of the region. We study conformal matter correlators in such a subregion. There is a gravitational constraint associated with York time evolution within the causal diamond of the subregion. This constraint can be leveraged to construct gauge-invariant observables in quantum gravity, using a crossed product construction. The extrinsic curvature of Cauchy slices acts as the physical clock. This is a simple example of how gauge-invariant observables can be obtained by dressing to features of a spacetime (or other fields), without the need for introducing an external observer. The entropy associated with this algebra of observables is not an area, or any boundary term. We show that gravitational constraints only give boundary formulas for entropy when gauging isometric diffeomorphisms. York time flow is merely a conformal isometry, not an actual isometry, and thus leads to bulk contributions to entropy.

By deriving an extended first law where the central charge \\(C\\) is a thermodynamic variable, we systematically explore both canonical and mixed ensembles. In the canonical ensemble with fixed charges, we identify a van der Waals-like phase transition between small and large black holes, marked by a characteristic swallowtail structure and coexistence curves with a negative slope. In contrast, within the mixed ensemble of fixed electric potential, the system exhibits a Hawking-Page transition between confined and deconfined phases of the boundary CFT. Our key finding is the suppressive role of the non-Abelian Yang-Mills charge \\(\\tilde{q}\\): increasing \\(\\tilde{q}\\) lowers both the minimum and the Hawking-Page transition temperatures, significantly narrowing the stability window of the confined phase. These results, supported by detailed numerical analysis, reveal a rich, ensemble-dependent phase landscape and establish the non-linear Yang-Mills sector as a critical controller of confinement physics in strongly coupled holographic systems.",

Recent studies show that some PBHs can survive to the present epoch by gaining angular momentum through Hawking radiating photons and becoming extremal before complete evaporation. While this provides a plausible model in a two-derivative theory of gravity, additional issues arise in EFT-corrected theories of gravity. In such theories, a rapidly spinning black hole can lead to extremely high tidal forces on a near-horizon observer, with possible observational consequences. In this work, by modeling Hawking radiation as a biased random walk within an EFT of gravity, we show that nearly the same fraction of PBHs survives as in GR. We argue that the resultant near horizon tidal effects should be detectable in future gravitational-wave observables.",

By employing real-space techniques to evaluate graviton interactions with minimally coupled scalar and electromagnetic fields in a de Sitter background, we show that the $1/(D-4)$ pole universally generates a dynamical Gauss-Bonnet term. This confirms that the scaling is not an ad-hoc classical limit but a necessary consequence of quantum field-theoretic renormalization. Furthermore, canceling the remaining divergences strictly requires the inclusion of quadratic curvature counterterms, specifically Weyl-squared and $R^2$ invariants.

A Fefferman-Graham analysis of SDYM is performed to identify its boundary CFT data. We make a proposal for self-dual holography that defines $3d$ ``self-dual CFTs''. The bulk-to-bulk and boundary-to-bulk propagators for SDYM and for Yang-Mills/Chalmers-Siegel theory with mixed boundary conditions are derived in Feynman and axial gauges. Three- and four-point functions are computed in the spinor-helicity formalism, and the relations among the results in the various theories are clarified.

While gravity experiences time-reversal, the Chaplygin gas always evolves forward in time, realizing a transient mismatch in thermodynamic arrows of time. Time-reversal affects the scale-factor, enforcing a non-singular bounce in causal frame that is robust against any additional matter.",

We propose a recursive formula which conveniently expresses the HAB formula. In this formula, gluons are converted into massless scalars. Thus it expresses a YMS amplitude with massive scalars by amplitudes with fewer gluons, massive scalars and massless scalars. We verify this formula by using soft behavior approach. In the massless limit, the HAB formula turns into expressions for YMS amplitudes with massless scalars which was earlier shown to satisfy an alternative recursive expansion formula. In this note, we show the equivalence of these two distinct approaches through explicit calculation on amplitudes with one and two gluons.",

The present paper addresses the inverse problem, for which we consider quadrupole moments of pulsar timings due to GWs from a dominant isolated source such as a binary of supermassive black holes over an isotropic stochastic background. Correlations between the quadrupole moments are discussed, where the correlations between pulsar pairs over the full sky are taken into account. The correlations turn out to be in the form of a three-dimensional traceless matrix with rank 2 that can be closely related with a projection tensor for the GW. Thereby, we demonstrate that the rank-2 matrix allows to estimate the DOA of the GW. In expectation of the forthcoming Square Kilometer Array, angular resolutions as well as DOA estimation errors are also examined.",

We systematically investigate the influence of various parameters on the energy extraction process, comparing the results in two distinct regions: the circular orbit region and the plunging region. {The results reveal that the Lorentz-violating parameter has a significant impact on energy extraction, affecting not only the parameter space where energy extraction is possible, but also the energy extraction power and efficiency.} It is found that the energy extraction process in the circular orbit region can offer a promising avenue for constraining KR gravity. In contrast, although energy extraction from the plunging region remains feasible even for black holes with relatively low spins and takes place nearer to the event horizon, its sensitivity to the Lorentz-violating parameter is significantly reduced. Overall, the Comisso-Asenjo magnetic reconnection mechanism can serve as a probe of the KR field, particularly through the energy extraction process in the circular orbit region.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the thermodynamic evolution and endpoint of black hole evaporation in the framework of metastring theory and its particle excitations, the metaparticles. Metaparticles arise as zero modes of metastrings propagating on modular (doubled) spacetime and obey a modified dispersion relation exhibiting intrinsic UV/IR mixing controlled by a duality scale mu. Using a generalized Bekenstein argument adapted to metaparticles, we derive quantum-corrected entropy contributions associated with geometric and dual (winding-like) sectors of the underlying phase space.   When treated independently, these two entropy branches lead to an incomplete thermodynamic description, exhibiting unphysical behavior at small horizon area. We show that consistently treating the metaparticle as a single entangled quantum object -- rather than as two independent sectors -- naturally resolves these pathologies. We propose a pseudo-entangled total entropy that incorporates correlations between the geometric and dual sectors. The reality requirement of the entropy dynamically enforces a minimal horizon area and, equivalently, a minimal effective length scale associated with modular spacetime.   The resulting black hole thermodynamics exhibits a finite maximal temperature, a divergence of the heat capacity signaling a continuous phase transition, and a shutdown of Hawking radiation through geometric channels, leaving behind a cold, stable remnant. Unlike matter-supported or curvature-bounded regular black holes, the remnant obtained here is non-material and non-geometric in nature, corresponding to a finite modular core of spacetime rather than a dust-filled interior. We compare this scenario with mimetic gravity and other non-singular black hole models, emphasizing the distinct role played by first-class constraints, entropy, and modular geometry in the present framework.",

We also analyze the motion of test particles, focusing on how surrounding matter components affect trajectories, stability conditions, and effective potentials. Scalar field perturbations are considered to investigate the BH response to external excitations and to extract information regarding its dynamical properties. In this case, the thermodynamic behavior of the system is studied, including the role of string clouds and dark matter in modifying BH thermodynamic quantities.

In this framework, the energy exchange between dark energy and dark matter induces a redshift dependence of $H_0$. We evaluate the model against a comprehensive suite of observations, including baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) from DESI DR2 and SDSS, cosmic chronometers, type Ia supernovae from the Pantheon sample, and Planck CMB distance priors. Analysis of late-Universe data yields $α= 0.0107^{+0.0032}_{-0.011}$, with the best-fit value on the order of $10^{-2}$, revealing a decreasing trend of $H_0$ with redshift. This supports a power-law evolution beyond $Λ$CDM. Incorporating CMB data further tightens the constraint to the order of $10^{-5}$, which we attribute to the suppression of dark-sector interactions at high redshifts, a consequence of the strong baryon--photon coupling. These results indicate that the IDE framework provides a theoretically consistent and observationally viable mechanism for describing the redshift evolution of $H_0$, offering a promising avenue toward alleviating the Hubble tension.",

A longstanding question is whether magnetic flux can accumulate near the event horizon to such an extent that it halts accretion entirely, enabling energy extraction purely from spin. Previous studies have shown that accretion persists through instabilities and that jet power only modestly exceeds the accretion energy budget, yet some observational results suggest much higher efficiencies. Here we present state-of-the-art general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations that sustain a quasi-steady magnetically arrested disk state for approximately 10,000 dynamical times, during which accretion is globally suppressed across the full azimuthal extent. In this regime, jet power exceeds the accretion energy input by more than two orders of magnitude, demonstrating a previously unachieved level of efficiency. These results challenge conventional assumptions about the limits of black hole energy extraction and suggest a new framework for interpreting powerful jet systems. Our findings raise important questions about the long-term stability of such states and the fundamental limits of the Blandford-Znajek process.",

If a source mass is prepared in a localized (classical- like) state, it will cause another probe mass to move towards it. Here we consider the situation in which a source mass is prepared in a quantum superposition of distinct spatial states while a probe mass interacts with it. Conditional on the detection of the source mass in a specific state, the probe mass will be found to move away from the source mass (repulsion). This signifies the quantum superposition of gravitational forces acting on the probe mass and thereby the fact that spacetime can exist in quantum superpositions. The technique used is the repulsive effect arising from an anomalous negative weak value. A potential experimental implementation with spin bearing nanocrystals is outlined.",

In fact, the shadow of a SLAB with a fixed mass becomes easier to detect with increasing redshifts past $1.6$. The limits are powerful enough to rule out SLABs of mass $\\gtrsim 10^{17}\\ M_{\\odot}$ within the last scattering surface, and imply $Ω_{BH} \\lesssim 10^{-5}$ for masses $10^{15}$--$10^{18}\\ M_{\\odot}$.

Extending the work of de Gill et al. (A. de Gill, D. Singleton, V. Akhmedova and T. Pilling, Am. J.

We show that the often employed Schwarzschild-like form of the flat metric is not appropriate for the WKB calculation with an arbitrary $a(t)$, and instead derive a generalized Unruh temperature for the generalized Rindler metric where $a_0\\to a(t)$. We derive a generalization of the Rindler coordinates appropriate for arbitrary $a(t)$, and stress the importance of the role of the integrated acceleration $χ(t) = \\int^t dt'\\,a(t')$, which can also act as a temporal coordinate. We explore several non-trivial examples of $a(t)$ and their generalized Unruh temperatures. We additionally develop an approximation to the Unruh temperature for small deviations away from constant acceleration by the standard approach of considering the negative frequency content of a purely positive frequency plane wave of an inertial observer, as measured by the co-moving arbitrarily accelerated observer. Lastly, we develop and explicit coordinate transformation between the arbitrarily accelerated observer and conformal coordinates, where the plane wave structure of the solutions of the wave equation is readily transparent, and analogous to the form for the inertial observer.",

While past results seemed to indicate that graviton-induced decoherence of spatial superpositions happens only for macroscopic systems, recently it was shown that this mechanism can be enhanced through the system's own dynamical internal structure. In this work, we extend this analysis by including the interaction with a classical Newtonian potential. We show that, although the graviton bath alone dominates the mechanism for short times compared to a timescale established by the size of the quantum spatial superposition, the interplay between the gravitons and the internal degrees of freedom of the system renders decoherence inevitable in the long-time limit, even for microscopic masses. We also show that this mechanism is slightly slowed down by the interplay with the classical Newtonian potential, which, for systems without dynamical internal degrees of freedom, can even lead to recoherence, at least in principle.",

    "abstract": "We study the existence and radial stability of static, spherically symmetric thin shells separating two Schwarzschild--de Sitter spacetimes with parameters $(m_\\pm,Λ_\\pm)$. Using the Israel junction formalism and a linear barotropic equation of state $p = λ(σ- σ_1)c^2$, we decouple the sound speed $c_s^2 = λc^2$ from the equilibrium equation-of-state parameter $w_0 \\equiv p_0 / (σ_0 c^2)$ and derive the effective potential governing radial dynamics. For observationally motivated parameters, stable configurations with $σ_0>0$ and $0<λ\\leq1$ exist only when $m_+/m_- > 1$. Three distinct stability windows emerge, when $λ=1$: $-3/7 \\lesssim w_0 \\lesssim 1/2$ for $Λ_+ = Λ_-$, $-2/3 \\lesssim w_0 \\lesssim 1/2$ for $Λ_+ > Λ_-$ and $0 \\lesssim w_0 \\lesssim 1$ for $Λ_+ < Λ_-$. Positive-pressure shells ($w_0>0$) reside near the photon sphere, whereas negative-pressure shells ($w_0<0$) extend outward, reaching either the cosmological horizon or the static radius. Stability relies on the variation of $w(σ)$ with the surface energy density. Negative pressure (tension) stabilizes the system because the tension increases during expansion. Conversely, positive pressure stabilizes the system because the pressure increases during contraction. Finally, a static, stable, dark, fluid thin shell acts as a gravitational refractive layer that enlarges the black hole's shadow for a distant, static observer outside the shell. The effect depends on the shell radius $R_0$, the background parameters $(m_{\\pm}, Λ_{\\pm})$, and the equation-of-state. Dark fluid shells can be considered as theoretical toy models that illustrate qualitative effects. Future high-resolution black hole shadow observations could, in principle, use such models to explore how different equations of state might influence observable signatures.",

    "title": "Beyond Gaussian Assumptions: A new robust statistical framework for gravitational-wave data analysis",
    "abstract": "Many traditional algorithms applied in gravitational-wave astronomy rely on the assumption of Gaussian noise, a condition not always met. To meet this need, this study extends a robust statistical framework, advancing previous work on heavy-tailed likelihoods, that adapts the hyperbolic likelihood method for full frequency domain applications. The framework is designed to maintain high performance under ideal conditions while improving robustness against non-Gaussian noise and outliers in real-world data. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach through two key case studies. The first case study analyzes a massive black hole binary merger in simulated Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) data with Gaussian noise, showing that the extended hyperbolic likelihood method performs comparably to the more commonly used Whittle likelihood. The second case study examines a stellar-mass black hole binary merger using real ground-based gravitational-wave data containing non-Gaussian noise or overlapping signals, where our framework exhibits increased robustness and yields more accurate parameter estimations. Our results show that the hyperbolic likelihood better captures the true noise distribution, providing a flexible and physically motivated alternative for GW data analysis across current and future detectors.",

Following a brief review of the magnetic reconnection process in the plunging region of a Kerr black hole, we introduce the hotspot model and imaging method. Based on numerical simulations, we separately study the hotspot images in the plunging region without magnetic reconnection, with magnetic reconnection, and when the escape condition is not met. We also compare these with hotspot images in the circular orbit region. The results show that for hotspot images without magnetic reconnection, if the plasma follow plunging orbits, the flare intensity gradually decreases, whereas if they follow circular orbits, the flare intensity remains nearly constant. Additionally, we find that in the plunging region, the signal for energy extraction is weaker compared to that in the circular orbit region.",

    "abstract": "We develop a dark-sector selective trace-coupled extension of gravity in which the matter--curvature coupling depends exclusively on the trace of the dark-matter energy--momentum tensor, $T_χ$, defined from a canonical dark-matter field $χ$. This construction provides a microphysically specified trace sector, removes the usual matter-Lagrangian ambiguity of $f(R,T)$-type models, and preserves minimal coupling of visible matter by design. We derive the full field equations, the exact dark-sector exchange structure, and the linear scalar-perturbation system in gauge-ready form. In the sub-horizon regime, we derive effective modified-gravity functions governing structure growth and light deflection, and show that the model generically produces correlated, scale- and time-dependent departures from General Relativity in growth and lensing observables. Building on this structure, we formulate a perturbation-focused multi-probe framework based on redshift-space distortions, weak lensing, and CMB lensing, explicitly targeting degeneracy breaking beyond background-expansion tests. The analysis establishes the action-level and perturbation-level foundations of the model and provides a conservative, reproducible framework for translated linear-regime constraints within a dark-sector selective modified-gravity setting.",

    "abstract": "The authors wished to document the sensitivity improvement that has been contributed to the GW detection rate by detection algorithm research and development efforts, and set about re-analyzing S5 and S6 to determine the sensitive time-volumes of a modern pipeline and compare them to that of analysis algorithms of the day. To our surprise, this effort led to the discovery of GW070605, what at first appeared to be a previously unreported high significance binary neutron star merger at a time when only the Livingston detector (L1) was operating -- data that could not have been analyzed and a signal that could not have been discovered previously because the algorithms of the day required coincidence between two or more detectors. GW070605's end time occurs in LIGO's L1 detector at 2007-06-05 18:37:02 UTC, and is estimated to be a merger with component masses of 1.82$M_\\odot$ and 1.24$M_\\odot$. The GstLAL detection algorithm estimates that noise processes produce false positives at least as significant as GW070605 at a rate of $8.6\\times10^{-10}$ per year. Disappointingly, subsequent investigations revealed the presence of a previously undocumented hardware injection in the L1 detector's Y arm end test mass' excitation channel, whose time and properties match that of GW070605. The injection does not appear in the Gravitational Wave Open Science Center list of hardware injections. We determined that while there is no sensitivity improvement between GstLAL and previous algorithms at the null-result threshold, there is marked improvement at above null-result thresholds; specifically, an approximately 55-times detection rate increase from initial-era algorithms at a FAR threshold of 1 per 7000 years.",

We derive the Hawking temperature and specific heat capacity and examine the thermal stability and phase structure of the black hole. The results reveal non-monotonic temperature behavior and parameter-dependent phase transitions. We further study photon dynamics, including the photon sphere and black hole shadow, and show that both PFDM and string cloud parameters significantly affect the shadow radius and strong-field structure.   Additionally, we investigate the motion of massive test particles, circular orbits, and stability conditions. The corresponding effective potentials, specific energy, and angular momentum are analyzed. Finally, we explore quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) by computing the fundamental epicyclic frequencies and discuss how the model parameters encode observable astrophysical signatures.",

    "abstract": "It is shown that conformal symmetry exists in force-free electrodynamics (FFE) in Minkowski spacetime, a foundational framework for describing magnetospheres around astronomical objects. In force-free magnetospheres, charges are constrained to move along magnetic field lines and experience zero Lorentz force, due to the everywhere perpendicular orientation of electric and magnetic fields. However, a general angle-preserving conformal mapping of force-free fields does not necessarily produce another physically admissible force-free configuration when sources are present. In this work, we demonstrate that such invariance can nevertheless arise for certain choices of the free functions. Specifically, the governing stream equation is shown to be invariant under Möbius transformations. This symmetry reveals a structural linkage between known solutions and, notably, maps the region inside a magnetospheric horizon (the lightsurface) of one solution to the exterior of its dual counterpart, and vice versa.",

    "abstract": "We examine Schwarzschild black holes within the framework of gravitational thermodynamics, introducing an ``energy layer'' picture for black-hole mass-energy and exploring a possible energy-extraction mechanism termed ``quasi-superradiance.'' Building on the standard relations for Hawking temperature and Bekenstein--Hawking entropy, we formalize energy layers via quasi-local radial energy accounting (e.g.\\ integrating an effective local energy density over spherical shells) and connect this bookkeeping to the free energy $\\FHelm=M-Þ\\SBH$. We then extend the entropy correction ansatz with explicit series inversion and derive higher-order expansions for $Þ(M)$ and $\\FHelm(M)$, including logarithmic and inverse-mass terms. To enhance mathematical transparency, we add intermediate derivations, lemma/theorem statements, and appendices. The quasi-superradiant mechanism is framed as a Carnot-like thought experiment powered by the Tolman temperature gradient between the near-horizon region and infinity; we show that the generalized second law enforces the Carnot bound and yields integrated maximum-work inequalities. Throughout, we stress that the proposal is heuristic and intended as a consistency-checked framework for discussion rather than a claim of definitive new physics.",

By perturbing the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for photon null geodesics, we demonstrate that the unique field content of MOG breaks the observational degeneracy with standard General Relativity. We mathematically prove two distinct, time-dependent signatures. First, the massless MOG scalar field induces a volumetric ``breathing mode'' polarization, causing the total apparent area of the shadow to rhythmically expand and contract. Second, the massive MOG vector field undergoes quantum vacuum dispersion, arriving at the observer with a predictable time delay. This delayed massive wave sources secondary longitudinal metric perturbations that manifest as a sudden, asymmetric translational wobble of the shadow on the celestial screen. These dynamic geometric shifts offer a robust observational template for next-generation interferometry to strictly test the existence of massive force carriers and scalar fields in gravity.",

    "abstract": "We present the deepest systematic search for planets around mid-to-late M dwarfs to date. We have surveyed 8134 mid-to-late M dwarfs observed by TESS with a custom built pipeline and recover 77 vetted transiting planet candidates. We characterize the sensitivity of our survey via injection-recovery and measure the occurrence rate of planets as a function of orbital period, instellation, and planet radius. We measure a cumulative occurrence rate of $1.10\\pm0.16$ planets per star with radii $>1\\, R_\\oplus$ orbiting within 30 days. This value is consistent with the cumulative occurrence rate around early M dwarfs, making M dwarfs collectively the most prolific hosts of small close-in planets. Unlike the bimodal Radius Valley exhibited by close-in planet population around FGK and early M dwarfs, we recover a unimodal planet radius distribution peaking at $1.25\\pm0.05 \\, R_\\oplus$. We additionally find $0.954\\pm0.147$ super-Earths and $0.148\\pm0.045$ sub-Neptunes per star, with super-Earths outnumbering sub-Neptunes 5.5:1, firmly demonstrating that the Radius Valley disappears around the lowest mass stars. The dearth of sub-Neptunes around mid-to-late M dwarfs is consistent with predictions from water-rich pebble accretion models that predict a fading Radius Valley with decreasing stellar mass. Our results support the emerging idea that the sub-Neptune population around M dwarfs is composed of water-rich worlds. We find no hot Jupiters in our survey and set an upper limit of 0.012 hot Jupiters per mid-to-late M dwarf within 10 days.",

We show that while the fitting is improved, some features (e.g., Ni/Fe) remain to be improved. In this article, we extend our calculation to an aspherical explosion using the jet-induced explosion mechanism. The detailed pre- and post-explosion chemical profiles are calculated with a large post-processing network to capture the production of odd-number elements (V, Mn, Cu) and iron-group elements. We further explore how the jet-driven explosions create the diversity of models which could be compatible with the observed diversity in terms of $^{56}$Ni-mass vs ejecta mass, Ti-V relation, and stellar abundances. Finally, we apply the new collapsar models in the Galactic Chemical Evolution context. We study how the galactic stars, including the Zn-enriched star HE 1327-2326, can put constraints on the relative rates of collapsar and some of its model parameters. We show that collapsar could lead to significant changes in some elements, e.g., Zn. Our study shows that the collapsar is a necessary component to explain multiple elemental trends observed in the Milky Way Galaxy.",

This master sample allows for performance tests of photometric selections and unveils what types of sources, either AGN or young star formation, were producing excessive ionizing radiation in the early Universe. We identify AGN through broad H alpha emission-lines and report 6 new broad-line AGN at 3.5<z<7 identified by the deep (~8 hr) G395M THRILS survey. We investigate the photometrically selected EELGs in a color-color plot designed for ``Little Red Dot'' selection and demonstrate that it effectively removes AGN with non-extreme lines from the sample. EELGs with and without broad lines show similar optical line ratios. We compare emission-line morphology to EWs and continuum morphologies and find that [OIII] morphology is more compact at higher EW. ~10% of photometrically selected EELGs have broad Balmer lines, jumping to 35% in deep spectroscopy which indicates a significant fraction of photometrically selected EELGs may host AGN. However, many AGN selected as EELGs have incorrectly high photometric EWs. For sources with extreme emission-line EWs that pass our photometric criteria and host an AGN, we find that the narrow H alpha component dominates over the broad, especially in the highest-EW sources. This implies that even when an AGN is present, it does not dominate the extreme emission.",

    "abstract": "The bright gamma-ray blazar S5 1044+71 has been identified as showing very significant quasi-periodic oscillations in the Fermi-LAT data in recent studies, with a periodicity of about 3 years. With the completion of a new gamma-ray cycle, we aim to revisit the periodicity in Fermi-LAT data, and analyze all available multi-wavelength (MWL) data to search for possible correlations and time-lags. These observations will be used to test for the compatibility of the observed periodicity with a precessing jet from the supermassive black hole. We analyze data from Fermi-LAT, NuSTAR, Swift, AstroSat, ASAS-SN, ZTF, Pan-STARRS, and NEOWISE. In addition we present an analysis from historical observations from Palomar and Pulkovo. Single-band spectral variability, MWL correlations, and cross-correlations are computed. We then model the Fermi-LAT light curve with a precessing jet model, providing constraints on the geometry of the system and providing the evolution of the Doppler factor with time. The latter is used as input for MWL fitting of the spectral energy distribution. We confirm previous claims on the existence of a periodic gamma-ray signal. We detect significant spectral variability in gamma-ray, X-rays, and optical/UV data. We detect significant correlation between low-energy (infrared/optical/ultraviolet) data and gamma-rays, with a correlation index of about 1; the correlation between X-rays and gamma-ray is milder, with a correlation index of about 0.3. We do not detect any significant time-lag between bands. The Fermi-LAT light curve is successfully fit by a precessing jet model. The fit to the spectral energy distributions indicate that S5 1044+71 is a typical blazar, in which the gamma-ray emission is located beyond the broad-line region. All MWL observations we present in this work are consistent with the existence of a precessing relativistic jet from the supermassive black hole.",

    "title": "A White Dwarf Tidal Disruption by an Intermediate-Mass Black Hole as the Progenitor of Ultra-long GRB 250702B",
    "abstract": "The recent detection of GRB 250702B, the longest gamma-ray burst observed to date with prompt emission lasting $\\sim 2.5\\times 10^4$ seconds, challenges the conventional collapsar model. Its remarkable features--including an extraordinary X-ray flare at $\\sim 1.3$ days post-detection, a late-time transition from steep to shallow decay in the X-ray afterglow, and hard spectra extending from keV to MeV energies--point to a novel progenitor. Here we show that these multiwavelength signatures can be consistently explained by a relativistic jet powered by successive partial tidal disruptions of a white dwarf (WD) by an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH). By modeling the time-dependent accretion rate from repeated partial disruptions and the resulting jet evolution, we show that the external forward and reverse shocks account for the long-term X-ray, near-infrared, and radio afterglow, whereas the luminous X-ray flare originates from internal energy dissipation caused by collisions between fast and slow relativistic ejecta associated with the final complete disruption. Our findings establish IMBH-WD tidal disruption events as a viable engine for ultra-long GRBs.",

    "abstract": "The construction of Dyson spheres, megastructures designed to capture the total radiative output of stars, can be one of the most compelling techno-signature scenarios for advanced extraterrestrial civilizations. By considering equilibrium temperatures, we investigate the luminosities and fluxes of Dyson spheres built around two promising classes of host stars: white dwarfs and red M-dwarfs. Using radiative balance arguments and representative stellar parameters, we compute the temperature-radius relationship for full energy interception and place these hypothetical structures on the Hertzsprung-Russell (H-R) diagram to assess their observational signatures. Our results show that Dyson spheres around white dwarfs produce cooler and fainter blackbody emissions, peaking in the near- to mid-infrared, while those around M-dwarfs radiate more strongly but at longer wavelengths. In both cases, the equilibrium temperature decreases as R_ D^-1/2, while the total luminosity and observed bolometric flux remain fixed by the stellar output. These findings highlight the astrophysical suitability of low-luminosity stars as Dyson sphere hosts and provide practical constraints for future techno-signature searches using infrared surveys.",

    "abstract": "Transient X-ray obscuration in Seyfert 1 galaxies is thought to arise from clumpy accretion-disk winds near the broad-line region (BLR), but the wind structure and its short-timescale variability are difficult to measure because high-resolution spectra are often suppressed during deep low states. We analyse a coordinated XMM-Newton/NuSTAR campaign on Mrk 335 in June 2021, complemented by long-term Swift monitoring, which captured the source in an intermediate-flux state that preserves strong RGS absorption features. We first model the broadband spectral energy distribution to determine the ionising continuum and then perform self-consistent photoionisation modelling of the RGS spectra. The stacked RGS spectrum requires three photoionised absorbers with time-averaged log xi approx 3.63, 3.10, and 2.01 and outflow velocities |v_out| approx 5820, 3210, and 2140 km/s. Their properties are broadly consistent with the three-phase obscurer reported in the 2009 intermediate state, indicating recurring multi-phase obscuration over decade timescales. Using five consecutive RGS observations, we track the wind evolution on day timescales and find strong variability in column density and ionisation in all phases, together with smaller but coherent changes in outflow velocity. During a flare, the low-ionisation phase shows an extreme drop in N_H, and the subsequent epoch exhibits an increase in outflow velocity in all phases, consistent with rapid restructuring and possible radiative acceleration in a clumpy wind. The high-ionisation phase responds most directly to changes in the ionising luminosity, while the lowest-ionisation phase shows at most a delayed response. Order-of-magnitude constraints place the obscurer at BLR scales (approx 10^3-10^5 R_g), and simple continuity arguments suggest kinetic power that can reach the percent level of L_bol for plausible estimates of geometry and clumpiness.",

    "title": "Tidal Synchronization of Binaries in Pleiades",
    "abstract": "Tidal interactions in close binaries play a key role in the long-term rotational and orbital evolution. The distributions of circularization across open clusters (OCs) place strong observational constraints on tidal dissipation in binaries. However, direct observational constraints on synchronization among binaries in OCs remain limited. For the 125 Myr OC Pleiades, this work combines cluster membership from Gaia Data Release 3, rotation periods from the K2 mission, and orbital solutions of the binary population from a long-term spectroscopic survey, to investigate the degree of tidal synchronization in each binary by comparing the pseudo-synchronization period to the rotation period of the primary stars. Among 42 binaries with reliable orbital periods Porb and rotation periods, we identify seven tidally synchronized systems with Porb < 8.6 days, including one early-type system and six late-type systems. For binaries with longer Porb, primaries generally are super-synchronized, and most systems are eccentric. We find a synchronization transition near Porb ~ 8.6-14 days, comparable to the known circularization period (Porb ~ 7.2 days) in the Pleiades, which suggests similar critical period scales for synchronization and circularization in this coeval population. Synchronization depends much more strongly on mass ratio than on primary mass. Most synchronized systems in Pleiades have high mass ratios and are likely to evolve into double white dwarf systems. Tides likely impose strong rotational braking on close early-type binaries, while their influence on late-type close binaries is weaker, and their spins largely follow the single-star sequence.",

    "title": "Elevated Eccentricities in the Radius Valley Hint at Water-Rich Mini-Neptunes",
    "abstract": "While recent planet-formation models broadly reproduce the observed population of super-Earths and mini-Neptunes, as well as the bimodal radius distribution (the ``radius valley''), it remains unclear whether all these planets share a common rocky composition (a single popoulation of planets) or instead comprise two distinct populations -- rocky planets and icy planets (two populations of planets). The inferred eccentricity-radius relation, which shows a modest peak near the radius valley, provides a useful diagnostic for distinguishing between these scenarios. Here we use N-body simulations to examine how the radii and eccentricities of close-in planets depend on the masses and orbital configurations of their progenitor protoplanets. We find that final planetary eccentricities scale with the system initial Safronov number. In two-population systems, energy equipartition between rocky and relatively more massive icy protoplanets creates a strong eccentricity contrast between the two groups, which appears as a peak near the radius valley. This signature does not appear if planetary systems are composed exclusively of rocky planets (with or without H-rich atmospheres), as assumed in photoevaporation and core-powered mass loss models. Because the eccentricity-radius relation traces a dichotomy in the underlying protoplanet mass distribution -- most plausibly arising from formation at different disk locations -- our results suggest that a significant fraction of mini-Neptunes are water-worlds. The observed radius and eccentricity distributions may reflect a mixture of systems that host exclusively rocky planets, systems dominated by icy planets, and systems with both rocky and icy planets.",

    "abstract": "We present the optical follow-up of SNe 2022ywf and 2023zgx, two examples from the Iax subclass of thermonuclear supernova (SN) events. With peak absolute magnitudes of $M_\\mathrm{V} = -13.7$ and $-14.4$ mag, respectively, both objects belong to the extremely low-luminosity (EL) population of the class. A common origin of SNe in the Iax subclass is still under debate since the distribution of certain observables may indicate that the extremely low-luminosity explosions form a distinct population. We aim to estimate the physical properties of the two EL objects, including mapping the ejecta structure. We perform spectral tomography on the spectral series of SNe 2022ywf and 2023zgx around their maxima to map the physical properties of the ejecta. Together with the analysis of BgVriz photometry, a wide range of observables can be studied to investigate their distribution against luminosity. The constrained chemical abundances of the ejecta are compared to the predictions of the hydrodynamic simulations with similar peak luminosities. Constant abundances provide a good match for the distribution of chemical elements for both SNe 2022ywf and 2023zgx. The discrepancies compared to the least luminous pure deflagration model N5def_hybrid are minor, especially at post-maximum epochs. The two SNe also share similar characteristics in their constrained density structures, as well as the evolution of the photosphere. The analysis supports the assumption that pure deflagration models can reproduce the main characteristics of SNe Iax, even for the EL population. The presented indirect observational evidence indicates that these objects show similar intrinsic properties to the relatively luminous Iax sample and fit into the velocity distribution of the subclass.",

    "title": "Sulfur fractionation in coronal plumes as observed by Solar Orbiter/SPICE",
    "abstract": "Coronal plumes are bright, narrow structures rooted in coronal holes that contribute to the solar wind. Their composition, particularly elemental fractionation as a function of first ionization potential (FIP), provides diagnostics of plasma properties and magnetic connectivity. Earlier plume studies of fractionation using low-FIP elements reached conflicting conclusions. Intermediate-FIP elements may provide additional diagnostic insight, since their fractionation is thought to involve processes beyond those affecting low-FIP species. We investigate sulfur (intermediate-FIP element) in plumes to assess the presence of fractionation, its evolution, and its relation to wave activity. We analyzed Solar Orbiter observations of two plumes in an equatorial coronal hole during March--April 2024, using Spectral Imaging of the Coronal Environment (SPICE) to derive the sulfur-to-nitrogen ratio. EUV imaging and magnetograms provided additional context. Data were processed with the open-source Python tool Spectral Analysis Fitting Framework and Reduction of Noise (SAFFRON). Both plumes showed sulfur fractionation that remained constant within uncertainties. The fractionated plasma was co-located with strong magnetic footpoints, in contrast with the surrounding interplume plasma. These results provide the evidence for sulfur fractionation in plumes and suggest, consistent with the ponderomotive force model, wave dynamics in the chromosphere as a driver.",

    "abstract": "Precise empirical estimates of stellar radii have revealed that the radii of certain low-mass stars are inflated relative to stellar structure predictions: the largest inflations occur in magnetically active stars. Theoretically, the radii of magnetically active stars are in some cases found to be 'hyper-inflated' to roughly double the radius of a non-magnetic star with equal mass. Here we ask, do data exist which could allow us to search for empirical evidence in support of hyper-inflated stars? A photometric study of 44 eclipsing binaries in the Kepler field by Cruz et al. may help us in our search. The Cruz et al. study, although subject to large uncertainties, hints at the presence of hyper-inflation in some of the 88 stars in their sample. Their data enable us to set theoretical limits on the maximum strength Bc of magnetic fields inside their sample stars. According to our magneto-convective model, the average empirical inflations found from analysis of the Cruz et al. data can be replicated if Bc approx. 10 kG inside stars with masses greater than ~ 0.6 MSun. On the other hand, in stars with masses less than about 0.4 MSun, our model predicts that the average empirical inflations of the stars may approach hyper-inflated status. Such stars may require significantly stronger internal fields, i.e. Bc approx. 100-300 kG. High-resolution spectroscopy of the Kepler binaries could help to confirm or refute our conclusions.",

We explain why such models have unphysical velocity distributions unless the DFs of hot components satisfy certain conditions as J_φ-> 0. We show how DFs for both isotropic and radially biased spherical systems can be constructed with specified f(J). We show how to construct DFs for flattened systems with significant velocity anisotropy. Construction of self-consistent models rather than populations that are confined by an external potential leads to the conclusion that radially-biased spherical systems are generically unstable to quadrupolar perturbations. Chaos is likely key to maintenance of these constraints during adiabatic disc growth.",

Gas density ($G$) and star formation rate ($S$) co-evolve through a supercritical Hopf bifurcation, capturing the transition from quiescent stability to merger-driven starbursts. Scatter in dark matter halo properties, modeled as multiplicative noise via the \\textbf{Euler--Maruyama method}, broadens the bifurcation into a regime where noise-induced bursts occur below the deterministic threshold.   Simulations reveal a periodic signature, the \\textbf{Galactic Heartbeat}, emerging as a deterministic limit cycle validated by the \\textbf{data3} resonance peak in the star-formation spectrum. A radial reduction yields an effective \\textbf{Fokker--Planck equation} for burst amplitude; its stationary solution matches numerical PDFs, providing statistical closure.   Including differential shear $Ω(r)$ and spatially varying bifurcation fields reproduces spiral morphologies and AGN-driven quenching. Driving the growth parameter sub-critical ($r_{agn} < 0$) yields ``Red and Dead'' cores via attractor collapse. Dark matter halo scatter suppresses mean star formation while enhancing intermittency, offering a minimal yet interpretable framework linking local feedback and global potentials to macroscopic galactic evolution.",

Using a delay-spectrum-based estimator, we measure the HI power spectrum on sub-megaparsec scales and compare it directly to the power spectrum inferred from a catalogue of individually detected HI galaxies in the same field. After mitigating low-level broadband contamination through conservative outlier flagging in the three-dimensional power spectrum, cross-correlation of time-split visibilities yields a statistically significant detection on scales $3 \\lesssim k \\lesssim 20 \\, \\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ with a total signal-to-noise ratio of $\\sim 13$.

End-to-end validation is performed by propagating detected galaxies through the power spectrum estimator via both direct intensity-field construction and simulated visibilities, demonstrating agreement up to $k \\sim 20 \\ \\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, beyond which measurements become noise-dominated. A statistically significant correlation is also observed between the data and the simulated visibilities from the detected HI galaxies, which should be free of systematics.

    "abstract": "Enhanced inverse Compton (IC) losses at high redshift steepen diffuse radio spectra in galaxy clusters, making low-frequency (~100 MHz) observations favorable. However, low-frequency studies often lack the resolution needed to locate particle acceleration sites or separate diffuse emission from radio galaxies. In this paper, we unveil the properties of the radio relic in the distant cluster PSZ2G091.83+26.11 (z=0.822) by resolving the acceleration site and inspecting the downstream region. Using the European LOFAR (ILT) at 145 MHz, we study a radio relic at (sub-)arcsecond resolution for the first time below 1 GHz, complemented by arcsecond-resolution VLA data at higher frequencies. We confirm the diffuse emission is not a radio galaxy. A spectral index gradient toward the cluster center matches previous 5'' maps. High-resolution 0.4'' and 1.9'' images reveal emission ahead of the shock, connecting the relic to a radio galaxy. 1.9'' profiles across the downstream at 145 MHz and 3.0 GHz follow a log-normal magnetic field distribution. The 145 MHz shock surface shows a sharp discontinuity at the same location of a change in electron density, Rotation Measure, and fractional polarization, likely tied to magnetic field changes. Finally, we find hints of redshift evolution of the radio power versus cluster mass correlation. The impressive angular resolution achievable by the LOFAR long baselines is opening an unprecedented view of the low energetic plasma in galaxy clusters. This is extremely significant in the case of high-redshift clusters, where radio emission at low frequencies is less affected by energy losses but its detection is strongly limited by poor resolution.",

Using the Millennium-TNG hydrodynamical simulation, we assess the accuracy of these methods in the presence of realistic galaxy formation physics. We find that, while the 2-point statistics of velocities are reliably inferred on scales larger than $\\sim10\\,\\hMpc$, significant systematic deviations arise on smaller scales. These deviations originate from spatially correlated residuals in the TF and FP relations, driven by correlations between galaxy structural properties, star-formation history, and the local environment. As a result, TF- and FP-inferred velocity fields exhibit spurious correlations with the galaxy density field that cannot be explained by random scatter alone. We show that extending the TF and FP relations to include additional galaxy properties -- such as star formation rate, gas mass, and stellar mass -- mitigate these environmental correlations, particularly for late-type galaxies. Our results demonstrate that galaxy formation physics induces significant systematics in peculiar velocity measurements on non-linear scales, and that neglecting these effects may bias cosmological analyses.",

    "abstract": "Advancing the technological development of small inner working angle (IWA) coronagraphs is essential to enabling high-contrast imaging of temperate exoplanets with future extremely large telescopes. The PIAACMC has been shown to closely approach the theoretical limit for coronagraphic throughput but its performance has not been fully characterised on-sky. This study serves as the first on-sky characterisation of contrast and IWA performance of the PIAACMC and its first technological demonstration at sub-micron wavelengths. We designed and manufactured phase-shifting focal plane masks optimised for two cases, a narrowband 875 filter (875nm, 3% band) and a broadband z' filter (908nm, 14% band). We tested the coronagraphs both with an internal source and on-sky using MagAOX, the extreme adaptive optics instrument for the Magellan Clay 6.5 m telescope at Las Campanas Observatory. We show good recovery of the off-axis light's PSF shape within 92% and 97% depending on the separation when aligning the inverse set of PIAA lenses. We demonstrate sub-lambda/D IWAs of about 0.74 lambda/D in 875 and 0.76 lambda/D in z'. We reach average raw contrasts within 1 and 5 lambda/D with the internal source of about 1.6e-3 in 875 and 1.3e-3 in z'. These are mainly limited by the focal plane mask manufacturing errors, jitter, and residual quasi-static speckles in MagAO-X. We also show on-sky average raw contrasts within 1 and 5 lambda/D of about 1.4e-2 in 875 and 7.8e-3 in z'. These are likely limited by wavefront control, low-order aberrations, and poor observing conditions. Future work will improve the design and manufacturing processes of the focal plane masks to improve robustness and reach deeper contrast, as well as integrate focal plane wavefront control for non-common path aberrations correction.",

    "title": "Characterising the magnetospheric accretion process of DF Tauri's primary",
    "abstract": "The accretion process in young stellar objects (YSOs) is fundamental to the formation of stellar systems. This process governs the star's mass assembly, the transfer of angular momentum, and the shaping of the protoplanetary disc, thereby influencing planet formation. For classical T Tauri stars (cTTSs), which are low-mass YSOs, accretion is a well-understood process. Their strong, dipolar magnetic field truncates the disc at a few stellar radii. Material is then channelled along these magnetic field lines, creating accretion funnel flows that fall onto the star's surface. However, this paradigm, known as magnetospheric accretion, is limited to isolated stars. The accretion process in multiple systems has not yet been fully understood. This work is part of a series of studies designed to build a framework to understand the accretion process in multiple star systems. The specific goal here is to determine how the magnetospheric accretion model can be used to describe DF Tau, a binary system where only the primary star is accreting material. To investigate how accretion occurs in a system where a single star is orbited by a non-accreting stellar companion, we used a time series of high-resolution spectropolarimetric observations from the ESPaDOnS instrument. This allowed us to study the accretion-related emission line variability, the veiling, and the magnetic field topology of the primary star in the system. Our research concludes that the primary star of the DF Tau system undergoes typical magnetospheric accretion. This process is driven by a strong dipolar magnetic field, which funnels accreting material onto the stellar surface, creating an accretion shock. We also identified a significant difference in the magnetic topology of the two stars querying the influence of accretion of the evolution of the magnetic field, or capture of the secondary star.",

    "abstract": "Warm debris disks around main-sequence stars trace late-stage terrestrial planet formation. Motivated by the need for systematic searches of such systems, we identify debris disk candidates around FGK stars within 150 pc by combining a spectroscopically selected sample from LAMOST DR12 with Gaia astrometry and multi-band infrared photometry. Infrared excesses are identified through SED fitting and validated using conservative, source-by-source checks. This approach yields a final sample of 12 debris disk candidates including ten new detections. Stellar age research indicate that most of the host stars are several billion years old. NEOWISE monitoring reveals no significant W1/W2 variability, consistent with a circumstellar origin of the infrared excess. while a search for co-moving companions using Gaia DR3 reveals possible companions for only two candidates at very large projected separations ($\\gtrsim 10^4$~au). Three candidates exhibit excess emission in both the W3 and W4 bands, allowing estimates of characteristic dust properties. This work establishes a small yet reliable sample of debris disk candidates anchored in homogeneous LAMOST spectroscopy, providing a foundation for future studies of debris disk evolution and stellar activity.",

    "abstract": "Voids are parts of the cosmic web least affected by non-linearities and baryonic feedback. We thus calculate the sensitivity of voids to the nature of dark matter (DM), using ultra-light axions as a concrete model and the ongoing Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and \\textit{Euclid} galaxy surveys as observational settings. We simulate axion effects on voids using mass-peak patch simulations and find that: (i) axions suppress the formation of lower-mass halos leading to the merging of smaller (radius $< 25\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}/h$) voids into fewer larger (radius $> 25\\,\\mathrm{Mpc}/h$) voids; and (ii) voids in the presence of axions are emptier of halos, thereby suppressing the void-halo correlation function. These effects strengthen as axion particle mass $m_\\mathrm{a}$ decreases. We forecast improvements in axion constraints from the void size function (VSF; the void number density as function of their radius). A \\textit{Euclid}-like survey (effective volume of $73\\,\\mathrm{Gpc}^3$ with a prior on the other $Λ$CDM cosmological parameters from the Simons Observatory cosmic microwave background experiment) can limit the axion energy density (for $m_\\mathrm{a} = 10^{-25}\\,\\mathrm{eV}$) to $< 4.6\\%$ of the DM (at $95\\%$ credibility), about two times stronger than current limits. Conversely, we show that a Universe with a dark sector consisting of axions at the $10\\%$ level, as motivated by the string axiverse, can be recovered with $\\sim 2 σ$ preference. A DESI-like survey achieves comparable results. Axion and $Λ$CDM parameters have different degeneracies given VSF and galaxy power spectrum data, indicating future combined analyses will be most powerful in disentangling the DM nature. We anticipate our results will extend to other (e.g., warm or interacting) DM models.",

    "abstract": "We present a Monte Carlo study of galactic cosmic-ray (GCR) energy deposition and its implications for stratospheric chemistry, performed with the Geant4 toolkit. Primary nuclei (protons, $α$, CNO, and Si) were propagated through an atmosphere modeled from 0 to 120~g~cm$^{-2}$, considering both Polar ($R_{\\mathrm{c}}=0.1$~GV) and Equatorial ($R_{\\mathrm{c}}=15$~GV) geomagnetic cutoff conditions. The simulations resolve the variation of energy deposition with altitude for primary and secondary particles, revealing that $\\sim$~96\\% of the stratospheric energy budget arises from cascade secondaries within the 15--35~km domain. By converting layer-resolved energy deposition into ion pair production rates, we quantify the resulting formation of odd nitrogen (NO$_{\\rm x}$) and odd hydrogen (HO$_{\\rm x}$) radicals, which catalyze the destruction of ozone. The modeled production rates peak between 18 and 22~km altitude, leading to an estimated fractional ozone decrease of order $10^{-3}$--$10^{-2}$ under average GCR fluxes, consistent with observed background modulation over the solar cycle. These results establish a physically consistent link between cosmic-ray induced energy deposition and ozone chemistry, providing a benchmark framework for coupling high-energy particle transport to atmospheric photochemical models.",

    "title": "Eating planets makes you younger: The magnetic dynamo rejuvenation of GJ 504 by planetary engulfment",
    "abstract": "With the discovery of a few thousand exoplanets, questions have been raised regarding star-planet interactions and whether the presence of a companion may affect stellar properties. GJ 504 is an evolved (2 Gyr) Sun-like star with a short rotation period (3.4 d) and an intense magnetic activity, which is in stark contrast with what would be expected at such an evolutionary stage. One possible explanation is that a close-in, Jupiter-mass planet was pushed starwards by the action of stellar tides, inducing a stellar spin-up and ultimately a rejuvenation of the stellar magnetic dynamo. By characterising the large-scale magnetic field and magnetised wind of GJ 504, we aim to provide additional observational constraints to test such scenario. We analysed spectropolarimetric observations of GJ 504 collected with ESPaDOnS. Using Zeeman-Doppler imaging, we found a large-scale, dipolar, non-axisymmetric magnetic field with an average strength of 5.3 G, similar to that of evolved early-G type stars. We fed the magnetic field information into our 3D MHD simulation of the stellar wind and space environment of GJ 504, from which we constrained the wind-driven angular momentum loss ($\\rm \\dot{J}$). We then compared $\\rm \\dot{J}$ to rotational evolutionary tracks of GJ 504 for two scenarios: evolution with and without the engulfment of a close-in, Jupiter-mass companion. Between the two scenarios, only the planet engulfment can explain the observational constraints obtained previously in the literature, such as the stellar rotation and X-ray luminosity, and the $\\rm \\dot{J}$ we derived and rescaled to account for underestimated magnetic field strength. Although there are many other stars with similar masses and rotation periods whose rotation evolution does not require planet engulfment, we also identified HD 75332 as a candidate for planet engulfment, suggesting that GJ 504 may not be an isolated case.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the conditions under which $Δ(1232)$ isobars trigger a first-order phase transition within purely hadronic neutron-star matter, using the SW4L relativistic mean-field parametrization. For scalar-vector coupling differences $0.15 \\lesssim x_{σΔ} - x_{ωΔ} \\lesssim 0.2$ and $x_{σΔ} \\gtrsim 1.3$, the onset of $Δ^-$ resonances produces a van der Waals-like instability driven by a self-amplifying feedback in the scalar meson sector, in which the $Δ^-$ particle fraction acts as the order parameter of a Landau-type transition. A Maxwell construction yields a sharp density discontinuity at baryon densities $n_b \\sim (1.3$-$2)\\,n_0$, separating a $Δ$-free outer core from a $Δ$-rich inner core. The resulting neutron-star sequences satisfy all current multimessenger constraints: maximum masses $M_{\\rm max} \\approx 2.15$-$2.25\\,M_\\odot$, radii $R_{1.4} \\approx 11$-$12$ km, and tidal deformabilities $Λ_{1.4} \\approx 190$-$480$, compatible with NICER observations and GW170817.

These frequencies overlap quantitatively with those predicted for hadron-quark phase-transition interfaces, demonstrating that the mass-radius ``knee'', reduced tidal deformability, and $g$-mode spectrum conventionally regarded as signatures of quark deconfinement can be reproduced by a purely intrahadronic mechanism. This extends the masquerade problem from static observables to the domain of gravitational-wave asteroseismology, implying that a future detection of a discontinuity $g$-mode alone would not suffice to identify quark matter in neutron-star cores.",

    "title": "The Evolution of Nulling in Pulsars",
    "abstract": "Nulling is a phenomenon where the emission from a pulsar becomes undetectable (or significantly weaker) for a relatively short period of time, followed by a return to a normal emission state. The timescale of nulling ranges from a few pulse periods to many hours or even days. The fraction of time a nulling pulsar spends in a null state varies across the population of canonical pulsars, from 0 to 95 per cent. The long-term behaviour of a pulsar's nulling fraction, however, is currently unknown, as published values have typically been obtained through single observations. Here, we present the first long-term analysis of nulling behaviour in eight pulsars observed in the Parkes Multibeam Pulsar Survey over the course of eight to ten years. We also apply a new Bayesian method for pulse-energy analysis, yielding posterior estimates of the nulling fraction per observation. In several cases, the nulling affects only specific components of the pulse profile, rather than the entirety of the emission. Our analysis reveals that, while most pulsars show no significant trend in their nulling fraction over time, a subset exhibit some evidence for non-zero gradients in nulling fraction. In particular, PSRs J1048$-$3832, J1745$-$3040, and J1825$-$0935 show statistically significant trends over the span of the data. Studying the behaviour of nulling over years and decades is valuable as it can provide insights into the physical emission processes within pulsars. Studying how nulling evolves also provides valuable insights into pulsar evolution and the characterisation of the broader pulsar population.",

    "abstract": "Long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) frequently exhibit complex prompt emission structures with multiple temporally distinct episodes, such as a main emission (ME) phase followed by a weak extended emission (EE) tail. Whether these subcomponents from a common physical origin with similar classification properties, or instead represent fundamentally different emission mechanisms within a single event, remains an open question. Here, we present a systematic, pulse-resolved analysis of 22 \\emph{Swift}/BAT long-duration GRBs, each exhibiting a well-separated, bright ME ($G_1$) followed by a fainter EE ($G_2$) after a background-consistent quiescent gap. For each component, we independently measure standard classification diagnostics, including duration ($T_{90}$), spectral hardness ratio (HR), minimum variability timescale (MVT), and spectral lag. We then compare these properties between the ME and EE within individual bursts. We find that the EE is systematically softer (lower HR in 19 of 22 events), smoother (longer MVT in 17 of 22 events), and more diverse in spectral lag than the ME. However, both components still occupy the long-GRB track in the traditional duration-hardness and duration-MVT planes, indicating a common Type~II (collapsar) origin. These results suggest that the EE in long GRBs represents a physically distinct regime of the central engine, characterized by a lower luminosity, longer emission timescales, and evolved spectral properties, rather than a simple continuation of the main burst. This picture is consistent with late-time fallback accretion onto a black hole or proto-magnetar spin-down.",

    "abstract": "Interactions within galaxy groups are fundamental drivers of galactic evolution, and establishing a direct observational link between the dynamical processes of satellite galaxies and the rejuvenation of massive host galaxies remains challenging. We present a multi-wavelength work of J1611+4026, a unique triple system characterised by a massive early-type host galaxy, Component C and two gas-rich companions, Components A and B, which are currently undergoing a major merger in its near environment. Utilising deep optical imaging from DESI-LS and spectroscopic data from DESI and P200, we employ 2D morphological decomposition using \\textsc{GALIGHT} alongside joint spectrophotometric synthesis modelling with \\textsc{BAGPIPES} and \\textsc{CIGALE} to deconstruct the structural properties and star formation histories of the member galaxies. Crucially, we identify an asymmetric tidal tail extending $\\sim$15.15 kpc from Component A, confirming the ongoing interaction between the companions. Although Component C appears quiescent in both morphology and spectroscopy, we reveal a subtle robust signal of ``minor rejuvenation'', characterised by significant internal dust extinction of $E(B-V) \\sim 0.53$ and a UV excess. The reconstructed star formation history indicates a recent ($\\sim$100 Myr) starburst that contributes a negligible fraction to the total stellar mass ($f_{\\rm burst} < 0.1$ per cent). We propose that this activity is fueled by the accretion of metal-enriched gas stripped from the interacting companions. These results strongly suggest group pre-processing, where interactions between satellite galaxies drive low-level star formation in the massive host through gas transfer, providing a quantitative benchmark for interaction-driven evolution in dense environments.",

    "abstract": "The relative roles of secular disc processes and galaxy interactions in driving the growth of supermassive black hole (SMBH) remain unclear. We present a time-resolved, per galaxy analysis of SMBH mass assembly that explicitly tracks bar formation, merger events, and the environment along the main progenitor branches using the high resolution IllustrisTNG50 cosmological simulation. We analyze barred and unbarred disc galaxies in isolated and non-isolated environments using physically motivated boundary definitions. We found that SMBH fueling pathways are regulated by the environment through the timing of bar formation relative to mergers. In isolated barred galaxies, stellar bars form early in dynamically cold discs and establish sustained, coherent accretion phases that regulate late-time SMBH growth. In contrast, in non-isolated galaxies, SMBH growth is dominated by early merger-driven accretion episodes, whereas bars form later and contribute weakly to the primary growth phase. Unbarred control samples show that mergers can trigger rapid SMBH growth without bars, but such growth remains episodic, whereas isolated discs without bars lack sustained accretion. These results demonstrate an environmental bifurcation in SMBH fueling: mergers act as efficient triggers of early growth in dynamically active systems, while bars regulate prolonged accretion only when they form in quiescent discs. This study provides a unified time-domain framework linking galaxy environment, disc dynamics, and SMBH growth by resolving the temporal ordering of bars, mergers, and accretion.",

    "title": "A FUV - optical approach for studying hierarchical star formation in nearby galaxies with UVIT",
    "abstract": "Young star-forming clumps (SFCs) emit strongly in the ultraviolet (UV), making UV imaging ideal for detecting them. The Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) onboard AstroSat, with 1.5arcsec resolution, has enabled the characterization of recently formed (up to 300 Myr) SFCs on tens of parsec scales in nearby galaxies. The spatial distribution of SFCs with different ages can provide insights into the hierarchy of star formation. This study presents a semi-novel approach to characterize SFCs in two nearby spiral galaxies, NGC 5457 and NGC 1313, by combining UVIT FUV data with g-band data from the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS). We tested and optimized our method on NGC 5457 and showed that after proper background subtraction, the FUV-g color of SFCs can serve as an equally reliable age indicator as the widely-used FUV-NUV color. Next, we parametrized the star formation hierarchy in NGC 5457 using the two-point correlation function (TPCF) and found good agreement between the hierarchy parameters derived using FUV-NUV and FUV-g based ages. Using our FUV-g based SFC ages, we also constrained the global hierarchy parameter of NGC 1313 for the first time. The development of our FUV-g based method is motivated by the fact that the NUV channel of the UVIT is not operational, and there is a wealth of archival UVIT FUV-only observations of nearby galaxies. This work demonstrates the potential of our method in constraining the SFC ages and investigating hierarchical star formation in nearby galaxies using FUV and optical observations.",

    "abstract": "It is important to detect and study circumstellar disks around late-M and brown dwarfs of nearby young associations to understand how these very low-mass objects form and how rocky planets form around them. The detection of new very low-mass members of nearby young associations will also significantly improve our current understanding of young associations. We searched for new young very low-mass members with circumstellar disks in a sample of 3928 candidates. We constructed spectral energy distributions of all candidates using observational photometric data from DENIS, 2MASS, and WISE and trigonometric parallaxes from Gaia to detect infrared excess emission that indicates the presence of circumstellar disks. We then followed up spectroscopic observations of candidates to search for lithium to confirm their youth. The H_alpha emission line was used to detect accretion. We detected 23 among the 3928 candidates with circumstellar disks: Ten objects are new, and 13 were previously reported in the literature. Our mass estimates also indicate that 21 are brown dwarf candidates and 2 are very low-mass stars. DENIS J0534552-104808 has a Gaia distance of 238 pc and might be the first brown dwarf candidate member of a foreground population in front of the Orion D cloud. This foreground population is probably associated with the supergiant kappa Ori. Based on our spectroscopic observations, we detected lithium in 11 candidates. We also identified seven accretors and one potential accretor. The intense long-lived accretion detected in DENIS-P J0500245-333042, a 20 Myr old brown dwarf candidate may be additional evidence to favor the formation of rocky planets around very low-mass objects.",

    "abstract": "High-resolution cross-correlation spectroscopy (HRCCS) has emerged as a powerful technique for detecting and characterizing exoplanet atmospheres from the ground. While it has been highly successful for ultra-hot Jupiters and hot Jupiters, next-generation facilities such as ELT/ANDES will extend its reach to smaller and longer-period planets, including young sub-Neptunes and their progenitors. We investigate whether HRCCS with ELT/ANDES can robustly recover orbital parameters and atmospheric signals of the long-period sub-Neptunes V1298Taub and TOI-451c. For such systems, the slow Doppler drift of the planetary signal over a single night reduces its separation from stationary telluric contamination, increasing the risk of signal removal while detrending. We therefore quantify the impact of including out-of-transit exposures on signal recovery and parameter estimation. We simulate transmission observations in the YJH bands using the Ratri pipeline and analyze them with the HRCCS framework Upamana. For V1298Taub, we inject atmospheric signals consistent with HST, Spitzer, and JWST constraints. For TOI-451c, we explore models spanning sub-solar to super-solar C/O ratios to assess compositional sensitivity. We find that incorporating out-of-transit exposures significantly enhances detectability, provided that the detrending effects are consistently propagated to the template models prior to cross-correlation. Without this reprocessing step, recovered orbital parameters can deviate substantially from injected values or yield reduced detection significance. For V1298Tau b, >5$σ$ detections of H2O, H2S, and CO are achievable within $\\lesssim$10 hours (~2 nights). For TOI-451c, distinguishing sub-solar from super-solar C/O ratios requires $\\geq$18 hours. HRCCS with ELT/ANDES will therefore be a key tool for probing the atmospheric diversity of young, long-period sub-Neptunes in the ELT era.",

    "abstract": "We present a supervised, probabilistic taxonomic classification of asteroid reflectance spectra from Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3). Using high-quality Gaia DR3 spectra and a reference set of spectra from the literature consisting exclusively of asteroids with robust spectroscopic taxonomic types, we construct a principal-component (PC) representation of the Gaia reflectances. For each major spectral complex (C, S, X) and several end-member classes (B, D, A, L, K, V), we model the distribution of reference objects in PC space using multivariate kernel density estimation (KDE). This yields likelihoods for each spectral class and provides a quantitative measure of classification confidence.   Validation against a sample of objects with known spectral classes demonstrates good performance for classes with distinctive reflectance signatures, including the S-complex, D, V, and A types. Spectrally continuous classes (B-C-complex, K-L-S-complex, and X-complex) show the expected degrees of mixing given the limited wavelength range of Gaia's spectrophotometry. We further explore the compositional structure of six major asteroid collisional families using our Gaia-derived spectral classes, finding excellent agreement with ground-based spectroscopy and revealing enhanced detections of olivine-rich A type material in the Flora and Eunomia families, as well as new insights into the spectral diversity of the Tirela family.   The resulting catalogue constitutes a fully probabilistic taxonomic classification for the full Gaia DR3 asteroid sample. It offers a resource for studying the compositional structure of the main belt, identifying family interlopers, and linking asteroid populations to meteorite groups, and establishes a methodological framework for future Gaia releases, in particular for the validation of the Gaia DR4, expected by the end of 2026.",

    "abstract": "Rapid Blue Excursions (RBEs) are transient blue-shifted chromospheric absorption features widely interpreted as the on-disk counterparts of Type II solar spicules. We investigate their dynamic properties using high-cadence spectral observations combined with automated detection and spatio-temporal tracking algorithms. RBEs were identified through blue-wing Doppler asymmetry criteria and tracked using spatial connectivity and centroid continuity methods to determine lifetimes and kinematic evolution. The statistical analysis shows that RBEs are short-lived events with lifetimes predominantly between 20 to 60 s and a mean duration of approximately 75 s. The lifetime distribution follows an exponential decay profile, indicative of impulsive driving. Line-of-sight velocities range from 20 to 140 km s-1, with a mean near 26 km s-1. Projected lengths span 1.2-5.5 Mm with sub-arcsecond widths, and recurrence analysis reveals repeated activity at localized magnetic footpoints. Mass flux estimates suggest that RBEs transport significant plasma upward, contributing to chromospheric mass supply toward the corona. These findings reinforce the role of RBEs as dynamic conduits of mass transfer and key elements in chromosphere-corona coupling.",

    "abstract": "The Variables and Slow Transients (VAST) Survey on the Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP) is designed to systematically explore the dynamic radio sky, detecting sources that vary on timescales from minutes to several years. In this paper, we present Data Release 1 of the VAST Extragalactic Survey, which targets slowly evolving synchrotron transients in the southern sky. The observations were carried out between June 2023 and May 2025, comprising 2945 images of 276 fields spanning $\\sim 12300\\ \\mathrm{deg}^2$, observed at 888 MHz with a typical rms sensitivity of 0.24 mJy $\\rm{beam}^{-1}$ and 12-20 arcsec resolution. Each field was revisited approximately every two months, yielding 10 or 11 observations per field. The VAST pipeline extracts the light curves for all the observed sources, and additional filters are implemented to improve the reliability of the resulting light curve database. The light curve database contains 0.5 million sources and 6.4 million individual measurements, publicly available through the CSIRO data access portal. An untargeted variability search yields 117 astrophysical variables, including 27 pulsars, 40 radio stars (10 newly detected at radio wavelengths), 44 active galactic nuclei, two optically identified supernovae, one supernova candidate, one brown dwarf, and two sources without multi-wavelength counterparts that are yet to be identified. This data release provides the first large-scale, high-cadence, uniform view of long-term radio variability in the extragalactic sky and lays the groundwork for future population studies of radio transients with ASKAP.",

    "abstract": "To address the challenge of estimating redshifts when only single-band images are available, this study introduces a deep learning model named ViT-MDNz. Leveraging robust statistical priors learned from large-scale data concerning the correlation between redshift and morphology, the model can directly estimate redshifts and their associated uncertainties from single-band galaxy images. It integrates a Vision Transformer (ViT) to extract deep morphological features and a Mixture Density Network (MDN) to predict the full redshift probability density function. Trained and evaluated on approximately 300,000 single-band images from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys (DESI-LS), the model achieves a normalized median absolute deviation $σ_{\\rm NMAD} = 0.034$ and an outlier fraction $f_{\\rm out} = 2.6\\%$ in the $r$-band for redshifts up to $z \\lesssim 1$. Evaluations using probability integral transform (PIT) and continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) confirm that the predicted probability density functions are well calibrated and closely match the true distribution. These results demonstrate that competitive redshift estimates can be obtained using morphological features alone, and that incorporating color information further enhances the accuracy and robustness of the estimation. Therefore, ViT-MDNz provides a practical approach for redshift estimation of galaxy samples with limited photometric band coverage, contributing to improved completeness and usability of redshift catalogs for future large-scale surveys such as DESI and LSST.",

    "abstract": "Finding intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) and measuring their masses and spins are key to understanding massive black hole formation. White dwarf (WD)-IMBH binaries provide a unique probe because they emit both electromagnetic radiation and gravitational waves (GWs), thereby conveying richer information. However, such multi-messenger sources often enter the regime of strong gravity, where existing models fail to capture their relativistic dynamics. Here, we develop a fully relativistic model for the tidal response of a WD close to an IMBH and use it to study the secular orbital evolution as well as the GW signal. We find that for IMBHs more massive than 10^5 solar masses, tidal interaction becomes relativistic and sensitive to IMBH spin. The interaction generally dissipates binary orbital energy and angular momentum, but due to relativistic frame rotation, which reduces phase coherence across pericenter passages, the orbit-averaged tidal dissipation rate can be suppressed by up to about 50% relative to Newtonian predictions. Including tidal dissipation leads to more rapid damping of the orbital eccentricity, to the extent that the pericenter distance may even increase over time, potentially explaining quasi-periodic eruptions and secular orbital period growth. Such tidal effects accumulate into measurable phase and amplitude deviations in the GW signal. For typical space-based observations, the GW waveform mismatch can reach values of order 0.1 within 6 months. Our results indicate that relativistic tidal dissipation is both dynamically important and observationally essential for reliably predicting the multi-messenger signals of WD-IMBH systems.",

By this method, we expanded TRGB samples in global clusters to 91 with newer observational data. Our results show a decreasing trend in I-band luminosity for metallicities greater than $-$1, consistent with previous studies. The results show a robust trend fitting and the $\\rm M_{I}$ of TRGB is about $-$4.02 with extremely low metallicity.

    "abstract": "We report milliarcsecond-scale VLBI detections of compact radio nuclei in four spiral-hosted, double-lobed radio-loud AGNs (spiral DRAGNs), a rare class that challenges the traditional association of powerful jets with elliptical hosts. Using public VLBI data archives, we identify compact cores in four sources and resolve parsec-scale jets in two of them. The VLBI components show low brightness temperatures ($T_{\\rm b} \\approx 10^9$ K in the core) and jet-to-counterjet ratios consistent with only mildly relativistic intrinsic speeds ($β\\lesssim 0.6$ for inclinations $θ\\lesssim 80^\\circ$), indicating weakly powered pc-scale outflows. The low radio-Eddington ratios $\\log(L_{\\rm R,1.4\\,GHz}/L_{\\rm Edd}) \\approx -5$ to $-8$ support this interpretation. Three objects lie on the fundamental plane of black hole activity, implying that global accretion-jet coupling in spiral DRAGNs is similar to that in other AGNs. Comparison with recent GRMHD simulations of thin-disk jets suggests that the VLBI-scale cores in spiral DRAGNs may trace an early or intermittently magnetized phase of jet launching. The coexistence of weak pc-scale jets and large kpc-scale lobes implies recurrent or long-duty-cycle jet activity in these late-type hosts.",

    "abstract": "The gravitational wave $ω$ mode spectrum presents a unique window into the dense interior of neutron stars, probing physics inaccessible to electromagnetic observations. This work investigates the $ω$ modes of compact stars composed of quarkyonic matter. The quarkyonic model, which describes a cross-over transition between nucleonic and quark matter treated as quasi-particles, is formulated within the Relativistic Mean-Field (RMF) theory using the G3 and IOPB-I parameterizations. This core is surrounded by a mantle of hadronic matter, creating a multicomponent stellar interior. The overall Equation of State (EOS) is governed by two key parameters: the transition density ($n_t$), the QCD confinement scale ($Λ_{\\rm cs}$), which are varied to construct models consistent with current astrophysical constraints on mass and radius. We compute the complex eigenfrequencies (damped oscillations) of the fundamental and first excited $ω$ modes using the phase-amplitude method within a full general relativistic framework. Our simulations reveal that the admixed quarkyonic structure produces a unique $ω$ mode signature, distinctly different from pure hadronic or hybrid stars. The spectrum exhibits a strong, degenerate dependence on the EOS, where the stiffening effect of the quarkyonic matter influences oscillation frequencies and damping times in a characteristic manner. We also demonstrate that $ω$ mode frequencies for quarkyonic stars follow approximate universal relations, largely independent of the EOS.",

    "abstract": "Mid-infrared spectra of planet-forming discs commonly show prominent silicate emission, whose spectral shape is sensitive to the disc temperature distribution as well as its mineralogical composition. We report new James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations of the discs around Sz 96 and IP Tau and find that their silicate emission significantly changes in the 20 years since they were observed with the Spitzer Space Telescope (SST). Significant differences between the SST and JWST spectra are found for both sources, with flux variations of 10--15\\% in Sz~96 and 30--35\\% in IP Tau. Sz 96 dimmed at $\\le$ 18~$\\mathrm{μm}$ and did not change significantly at longer wavelengths, whereas IP Tau became brighter across the entire wavelength range, with a particularly strong enhancement around 10~$\\mathrm{μm}$ in the JWST data compared to the SST data. We propose that this large degree of variability is explained by structural changes in the inner regions of the discs. Specifically, we also find that crystalline silicates exhibit lower temperatures than amorphous silicates in the JWST data of both sources. This result supports the idea that crystalline grains, formed through high-temperature annealing in the inner disc regions, have been transported outward, leading to their presence in cooler regions of the disc. While similar behavior had been reported in previous SST-based studies, the much higher spectral resolution of JWST enables clearer identification of the crystalline features.",

    "title": "Identify ~20,000 Li-rich Giants in the LAMOST Low-Resolution Survey",
    "abstract": "Li-rich giants serve as valuable tracers of stellar evolution and surface enrichment processes, for which a statistically large and homogeneous sample is crucial. Using the massive low-resolution ($R \\sim 1800$) spectroscopic dataset from the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) survey, we systematically search for Li-rich giants by determining their stellar lithium abundances through template matching of the Li I 6708 Å absorption line with a grid of synthetic spectra generated from ATLAS9 model atmospheres. The derived abundances are validated against previous high-resolution studies, showing good consistency with a mean absolute error of about 0.15 dex. Therefore, we adopt a threshold of $A(\\rm{Li}) > 1.65$ dex to select Li-rich candidates, followed by visual inspection to ensure the reliability of each detection. Eventually, more than 20,000 Li-rich giants are identified, corresponding to approximately 2.5% of all giants in LAMOST DR9. We also investigate the occurrence rate of Li-rich giants in different evolutionary stages. This work presents a large and homogeneous catalog of Li-rich giants derived from the LAMOST low-resolution survey, which provides a reliable and valuable dataset for future studies of stellar evolution and lithium enrichment in evolved stars.",

    "title": "WFST Astrometric Calibration -- I. Modeling Global Geometric Distortion with Zernike Polynomials",
    "abstract": "Accurate modeling of geometric distortion is essential for precise astrometric calibration in wide-field imaging surveys. We present a self-calibration method based on Zernike polynomials, applied to imaging data from the Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST). Our approach constructs a global geometric distortion (GD) model from the position offsets of stars in the WFST r-band relative to Gaia DR3, achieving a median systematic uncertainty of below 10 mas for individual exposures. The correspondence between Zernike polynomials and optical aberrations reveals that the global GD of WFST is dominated by coma, inherent to the optical design, while rapid variations are likely attributed to the atmospheric dispersion corrector. Applying this method to 82 exposures from a single night (20250218), we find that the relative positions of the WFST CCDs remain stable, with standard deviations of less than 0.1 pixel in translation and 1.8 arcsec in rotation. The corrected WFST astrometric system is thereby tied to the Gaia DR3 coordinate frame, with further refinements to be presented in future work.",

    "title": "Using Lithium and Beryllium to Study Structure and Evolution of Rotating Stars: Spite Plateau of Halo Stars",
    "abstract": "The observed lithum (Li) abundance of Galactic halo stars mainly fall within the range of 2.0--2.4 dex. This nearly constant value, known as the Spite plateau, is approximately a factor of three lower than the value predicted from cosmic microwave background measurements and standard Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) calculations. This discrepancy -- referred to as the cosmological Li problem -- is considered a potential indication of new physics or astrophysical processes. We employed models incorporating gravitational settling, diffusion, rotation, and magnetic fields to explain the Spite plateau. The rotating models predict that Li abundances in stars with ages of roughly 8--13 Gyr and effective temperatures between 6400 and 5900 K generally fall within 2.0--2.4 dex, forming a well-defined Li plateau, followed by a sharp decline in Li abundance down to about 5200 K. The Li plateau results from the combined effects of variations in convection zone depth, gravitational settling, diffusion, rotation, and magnetic fields. For red giant branch stars with $T_{\\mathrm{eff}} \\lesssim$ 5200 K, the rotating models predict another Li plateau with an abundance of about 1.0 dex. These results are in good agreement with observations. Moreover, the initial Li abundance of 2.72 dex adopted in the models matches the BBN prediction, implying that the Li problem arises from stellar Li depletion. Furthermore, the rotating models also reproduce the Li and Be distributions of the sample that exhibit the Spite plateau meltdown and Be deviation.",

    "abstract": "Context:Satellite dwarf galaxies provide key constraints on galaxy formation and evolution as their abundance and spatial distribution reflect both host properties and large-scale environment.   Aims:This study quantifies the dependence of satellite populations on host stellar mass, morphology and star formation activity across diverse environments and traces their evolution with cosmic time within the LCDM framework.   Methods:The Millennium simulation combined with the semi-analytic model is employed to construct consistent samples of host galaxies brighter than Mr < -16 and their satellites (M_* >= 3x10^5 M_sun, Mr < -9) within their virial radius. Satellite abundance and radial profiles are analyzed in cluster, group and void environments and their evolution is traced from z=2 to z=0 across three host stellar mass bins.   Results:Satellite abundance correlates strongly with host stellar and bulge mass while host morphology has little additional impact once stellar mass is controlled for. Dense environments suppress satellite populations relative to voids. At z=0 radial profiles reveal strong central concentrations in voids flattened distributions in clusters and intermediate trends in groups. Their redshift evolution shows progressive flattening for low- and intermediate-mass hosts in dense environments stability for massive hosts and increasing central concentration in voids. The cosmic evolution of satellite abundance further highlights distinct pathways: gradual accumulation in voids, mass-dependent trends in groups and strong late-time suppression in clusters.   Conclusions:The distribution and abundance of satellite galaxies are governed primarily by environment with host stellar mass and cosmic epoch acting as secondary modulators. Forthcoming wide-field surveys such as LSST, Euclid and the Roman Space Telescope are expected to provide stringent tests of these predictions.",

    "title": "Accretion-modified Stars in Accretion Disks of Active Galactic Nuclei: Contribution to AGN disk viscosity",
    "abstract": "It is widely believed that stellar-mass black holes (sMBHs) exist within the accretion disks of active galactic nuclei (AGN), forming a distinct population termed ``accretion-modified star\" (AMS). Gas from the dense disk accretes onto these AMSs, dissipating substantial gravitational energy through a mini-disk around the sMBHs, which drives powerful outflows that interact with the surrounding disk gas. In this study, we investigate two scenarios for AMS accretion: episodic Bondi explosions with hyper-Eddington accretion (Scenario A) and steady Eddington accretion (Scenario B). These outflows generate turbulence, facilitating outward angular momentum transport in the AGN disk via shock interactions and angular momentum exchange. We explore a broad parameter space-spanning the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass ($M_{\\rm p}$), dimensionless accretion rate ($\\dot{\\mathscr{M}}_{\\rm p}$), sMBH mass function, and spatial distribution-to calculate the effective viscosity parameter $α_{\\rm AMS}$. Our analysis reveals the scaling relations $α_{\\rm AMS}\\proptoζM_{\\rm p}^2\\dot{\\mathscr{M}}_{\\rm p}$ for Scenario A and $α_{\\rm AMS}\\proptoζM_{\\rm p}^{1.5}\\dot{\\mathscr{M}}_{\\rm p}^{0.1}$ for Scenario B, where $ζ$ denotes the ratio of total sMBH mass to the SMBH disk mass. For $ζ={0.01}$ and $M_{\\rm p}=10^8 M_\\odot$, $α_{\\rm AMS}$ ranges from $\\sim{3\\times10^{-4}}$ to ${0.01}$ (Scenario A) and $\\sim{3\\times10^{-3}}$ to ${0.04}$ (Scenario B) from the inner to outer disk regions. These results demonstrate that AMS feedback provides an efficient mechanism for angular momentum transport in AGN disks.",

    "title": "High Spectral Resolution X-ray Observations of the Evolved Supermassive Stellar Binary System $η$ Carinae - Iron K$α$ Band Profile Revealed with XRISM",
    "abstract": "The supermassive binary system, $η$ Carinae, is experiencing enormous wind-driven mass loss at a rate unparalleled in the rest of the Galaxy. Their wind-wind collision (WWC) continuously produces shock heated, X-ray emitting plasmas. The XRISM X-ray observatory observed the system in 2023 and 2024 when the X-ray emission began to increase toward periastron passage in 2025. This manuscript reports unprecedentedly high-resolution X-ray spectra in the iron K$α$ band between 6.2 and 7.1 keV, obtained with the Resolve X-ray microcalorimeter. The hydrogen-like (Ly$α$) and helium-like (He$α$) lines reveal three velocity components. Two of them are broadened with maximum velocities of 2000-3000 km/s, likely originating from the post-shock companion wind. The other is relatively narrow, with a Gaussian broadening of only ~290 km/s in 1 sigma, which may originate from the post-shock companion wind at the WWC stagnation point or penetrating the primary wind. The iron fluorescent lines exhibit a moderate blueshift and broadening with velocities at 100-200 km/s, consistent with the primary wind's velocity field. The spectra also confirm a Compton shoulder of the He$α$ line complex for the first time. Both fluorescing and scattering spectral profiles indicate that the binary system is seen from the companion side during these observations. The flux ratio of the Compton scattering emission to the fluorescent line suggests substantial hydrogen depletion of the primary wind, expected from CNO-cycled hydrogen nuclear fusion gas.",

    "abstract": "The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission has facilitated studies of asteroseismology, eclipsing binaries, and transits in many stars. However, the brightest stars saturate TESS, yet they are the most amenable to photon-hungry high-resolution studies and have long observational histories. In this work, we adapted the halo photometry used in $K$2 to extract light curves from the unsaturated halo pixels of the star's point spread function. We used this method to extract light curves for 98 of the brightest stars observed by TESS in Sectors 1-93. These bright stars include 15 red giants, five $δ$ Scuti variables, eight stochastic low-frequency variables, eight eclipsing binaries, and 46 other variables. We measured $ν_{\\rm max}$ for 13 red giants using pyMON and $Δν$ for one of them, $β$ Gem (Pollux). For five of them, this represents the first time that oscillations were detected. We derived their stellar masses using the measured $ν_{\\rm max}$ and previous interferometric and radiometric angular diameters. We also discovered $δ$ Scuti and $γ$ Doradus variability in $α$ Cep, possible asteroseismic binary signatures in $ε$ Car, and a new eclipsing binary, $γ$ And. Furthermore, we identified 18 stars in our sample that will be observed by the future PLAnetary Transits and Oscillations of stars (PLATO) mission, and 69 stars that have Stellar Observations Network Group (SONG) observations, including some simultaneous with TESS. The light curves are publicly available on the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes.",

This release, \\texttt{PICASO 4.0}, expands upon the existing radiative-convective equilibrium model framework by incorporating several new capabilities. Key additions include the integration of \\texttt{Virga} for self-consistent cloud modeling, new flexible treatments for rainout and cold trapping of volatile species, and support for photochemistry. We also introduce a parameterized energy injection scheme to simulate additional external or internal heating processes. These features are motivated by lessons from recent JWST observations that reveal the prevalence of non-equilibrium chemistry and clouds. We benchmark the new functionalities against previously published results in the literature, including the Sonora Diamondback grid, energy injected atmospheres, patchy cloud models, and other photochemical models of WASP-39b. \\texttt{PICASO} continues to be actively developed as an open-source package aimed at enabling reproducible, community-driven atmospheric modeling of all substellar objects.",

    "abstract": "The $γ$-ray-emitting narrow-line Seyfert-I ($γ$-NLSy1) are among the most interesting systems for studying disk-jet coupling. The soft X-ray properties of these systems suggest the presence of a disc component, which peaks in the optical/UV regime, in addition to the active jet. In this work, we investigate the optical emission from $γ$-NLSy1 using long-term Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) observations and discussed in the context of blazars. We have reported the long-term flux and color variability in the g- and r-bands. The fractional variability ($F_{\\rm var}$) goes as high as 72\\%, with a mean value of 23\\%, while the amplitude of variability ($ψ$) values range from 0.24 to 3.20, which is consistent with the long-term Swift-UVOT variability studies. The color-magnitude diagrams exhibit an RWB or BWB trend similar to that of blazars. The $t_{\\rm var}$ suggests an emitting region size of $10^{15-17}$ cm, aligned with emissions coming from the inner accretion disk or base of the jet. The PSD analysis using both DRW and CARMA modeling exhibits a characteristic break timescale of a few days to hundreds of days, which is likely linked to fundamental physical timescales in the system, such as thermal or viscous timescales in the accretion disk or timescales for acceleration and energy dissipation in the jet. The existence of these timescales acts as another signature of the disc-jet connection. These time scales are correlated with black hole mass, and the relation is consistent with previous studies.",

(2019), to our Cepheid candidates in each galaxy and correct for potential effects of metallicity. Using a distance constraint for the LMC given by Pietrzyński et al. (2019), this yields a distance modulus of $μ= 31.083 \\pm 0.035$ mag for NGC 4303 and $μ= 30.150 \\pm 0.106$ mag for NGC 1068. Thus, we measure distances of $D = 16.47 \\pm 0.27$ Mpc to NGC 4303 and $D = 10.72 \\pm 0.52$ Mpc to NGC 1068.",

    "abstract": "We analyzed millimeter-wave data toward the quasar B0218+357 observed with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array and obtained absorption spectra of the $J$=2-1 and $J$=3-2 rotational transitions of HCN, HCO$^{+}$, HNC, H$^{13}$CN, and H$^{13}$CO$^{+}$ at the cosmological redshift of $z\\!=\\!0.68$. For HCN, HCO$^{+}$, and HNC, we identified two distinct absorption components that are common to both transitions, whereas a single component was detected in the isotopologue spectra. In this paper, we accurately evaluate the excitation temperatures and their uncertainties from the absorption strengths of these components, and use them to determine the CMB temperature. Uncertainties in the continuum covering factor were propagated into the excitation temperature via Monte Carlo sampling. We further corrected the observed optical depths for biases due to column-density nonuniformity by assuming a lognormal column-density distribution. Under the assumption that the rotational levels are in radiative equilibrium with the cosmic microwave background (CMB), we derived excitation temperature profiles in the optically thin regime. Because the excitation of HCO$^+$ is biased by an additional velocity component and partial collisional excitation, this species was excluded from the final determination of the CMB temperature. From a weighted mean of the excitation temperatures obtained from HCN and HNC, we determined the CMB temperature at $z\\!=\\!0.68$ to be ${4.50\\pm0.17\\,\\mathrm{K}}$. This constitutes the first measurement of the CMB temperature at $z\\!=\\!0.68$ based on a quasar absorption line system and represents the most precise determination at this redshift, highly consistent with the standard Big Bang cosmological model.",

    "abstract": "We test whether \"Little Red Dots\" (LRDs) are dust-reddened, high-inclination counterparts of compact, blue broad-line AGNs (\"Little Blue Dots\", LBDs) powered by super-Eddington accretion. We model the central engine as a geometrically thick, radiation-pressure supported accretion flow whose funnel yields strongly anisotropic, intrinsically blue ionizing continua, coupled to an equatorially concentrated BLR and a dusty screen with modest covering factor. Using inclination-dependent SEDs as input to Cloudy, we show that the extreme broad Halpha equivalent widths (EWs) of JWST LRDs are reproduced with global BLR covering factors of only 15%, consistent with standard Type 1 AGNs. Large Balmer EWs arise because self-shadowing suppresses the high-inclination optical continuum while the BLR is illuminated by an EUV-rich SED. Weak high-ionization lines follow from orientation-dependent suppression of the XUV/soft X-ray continuum toward equatorial directions, without requiring a fully enclosing gaseous \"cocoon\". With a gray attenuation law of AV = 2.8 along LRD-selected sightlines, the fiducial model matches the V-shaped UV-optical continua and large Balmer decrements; strong Balmer breaks occur only for the most obscured views. A compact equatorial dust component tied to the BLR and normalized by energy conservation intercepts and reradiates only a small fraction of Lbol, producing a modest hot-dust bump and far-IR/sub-mm emission consistent with current limits and implying small dust masses. The model unifies LRD and LBD observables via orientation, predicting correlated trends in Halpha EW, Balmer decrement, Balmer break, high-ionization line strengths, and IR emission.",

    "abstract": "We present 3D-Herschel, a new 0.3-350$μ$m photometric catalog that combines deblended Herschel far-infrared (FIR) imaging with the CANDELS/3D-HST legacy fields to probe the dust-obscured universe. Using the 17-parameter fitting code Prospector-$β$, a Bayesian inference framework, we model 41,387 galaxies spanning 0.5 $< z <$ 2.5 to measure stellar and dust properties with realistic error bars. Comparing fits with and without FIR constraints, we find that for the 3.2$\\%$ of galaxies with $>3 σ$ detections in at least two Herschel bands, UV-MIR-only models (0.3-24$μ$m) recover robust stellar ages, SFRs, and stellar masses (50-70$\\%$ within the median 1$σ$ error). Consequently, the star-forming sequence shows no systematic offset, with an average deviation of 0.1$\\pm$0.07 dex at fixed stellar mass for FIR-detected sources at all redshifts. However, the use of rigid log-average IR templates with fixed dust emission parameters ($γ$, $U_{\\mathrm{min}}$, $Q_{\\mathrm{PAH}}$) in UV-MIR modeling corresponds to an unevolving MIR-to-IR luminosity ratio and cold dust temperatures. By contrast, fits that include Herschel photometry, with added freedom in the FIR, yield dust temperatures that are $\\sim$7K warmer at all redshifts, with $\\sim$0.2 dex higher IR-to-7.7$μ$m luminosity ratios at the low-mass end of a Herschel-detected sample (log($M_{\\star}$) $\\sim$9.6 $M_{\\odot}$). These results demonstrate that MIR-to-IR conversions depend on stellar mass, cautioning against $L_{\\mathrm{IR}}$-independent templates without FIR data. For galaxies with $<10^{11} \\ M_{\\odot}$ at $z>1.5$, even with state-of-the-art analysis, Herschel can at best provide upper limits due to source confusion; next-generation FIR telescopes will be essential to fully characterize dust emission in distant galaxies.",

    "title": "Identifying Evolutionary Stages of Molecular Clumps through Unsupervised and Supervised Machine Learning",
    "abstract": "The evolutionary classification of molecular clumps, crucial for understanding star formation, is commonly based on human-assigned categories derived from infrared (IR) emission and well-established morphological criteria. However, due to ambiguous signatures, distance uncertainties or heavily obscured IR emission, a significant fraction of sources often remains unclassified. This work demonstrates the capability of machine learning (ML) as a complementary, data-driven approach to automate the identification and classification of these clumps using data from the MALT90 survey, complemented by Spitzer IR photometry. We applied unsupervised clustering with HDBSCAN on molecular line intensities, revealing distinct groupings that correspond to evolutionary stages. Using only five molecular lines (HCO$^+$, HNC, N$_2$H$^+$, HCN, C$_2$H), we identified stable clusters of protostars and regions without active star formation, driven primarily by C$_2$H and N$_2$H$^+$ emission. Incorporating H$^{13}$CO$^+$ gave rise to a distinct UV-dominant cluster, tracing more evolved regions. Infrared properties appeared as non-significant features implying that envelopes of clumps with different masses are similar in their global infrared characteristics. We then employed supervised learning to classify clumps with previously uncertain categories and provided classifications for 522 objects, predominantly as regions without active star formation. Our results show that ML techniques can effectively uncover intrinsic evolutionary structures in complex astrochemical data and assign categories to uncertain sources, providing a powerful, data-driven complement to traditional methods.",

    "abstract": "Using JWST/MIRI observations, we report the detection of CO$_2$ ice in the dusty torus of the planetary nebula NGC 6302, an environment generally considered hostile to fragile molecular species and ices due to intense UV irradiation. This detection accompanies cold (20-50 K) gas-phase CO$_2$ along the same sightlines. The ice absorption profile exhibits a double-peak profile, a characteristic of pure, crystalline CO$_2$ ice. The CO$_2$ gas-to-ice ratio is more than an order of magnitude higher than in young stellar objects, pointing to distinct ice formation or processing mechanisms in evolved stellar environments. This discovery demonstrates that the dusty torus provides sufficient shielding to harbour ice chemistry, and that ice-mediated surface reactions must be incorporated into chemical models of planetary nebulae.",

To address this, we present STILTS-NLI, a natural language interface that generates STILTS commands from user prompts, with agentic support for a user-friendly experience. We developed STILTS-NLI by fine-tuning a compact, open-source Large Language Model (LLM) on a synthetically generated dataset. This dataset was curated and validated to ensure both comprehensive coverage of key STILTS functionalities and the syntactic correctness of the resulting commands. Our results demonstrate that this specialised model generates valid commands that match and in some cases outperform larger proprietary models. By leveraging small, open-source models, STILTS-NLI provides an accessible, low-resource solution that lowers the barrier to entry for using STILTS.",

    "abstract": "Non-magnetic Cataclysmic Variables (CVs) show two distinct X-ray components: a hard, optically thin component and a soft, optically thick, blackbody-like component, both produced in the boundary layer between the accretion disk and the White Dwarf (WD). An additional soft component originating from a more extended region has been reported in few CVs. In a short Chandra exposure, we identified a tentative X-ray eclipse in UU Aqr, a non-magnetic CV which shows deep optical eclipses. Using observations with the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) and the XMM-Newton, we detect total eclipses in the orbital intensity profiles of this system in the hard X-ray band (3-10 keV with XMM and 3-25 keV with NuSTAR). However, the soft X-ray band (0.3-2.0 keV) shows no evidence of an eclipse. Detailed eclipse modeling, energy-resolved power spectral analysis and broadband spectral modeling indicate that the hard absorbed X-ray emission originates from a compact region near the WD, such as a boundary layer, while the soft, unabsorbed and un-eclipsed X-ray emission originates in an extended region. Neither scattering of hard X-rays nor colliding winds can account for the observed un-eclipsed soft emission. We instead propose that this component is produced by shocks within vertically extended, radiatively driven accretion-disk winds. We also provide new estimates on the emitting regions, mass and radius of the WD and the donor star using eclipse modeling.",

    "abstract": "The chemical abundances of a stellar population encode information about nucleosynthesis and its astrophysical sites, but this information is confounded by the specific star formation history of the host galaxy. As a result, placing empirical constraints on supernova yields and timing using abundances has been very challenging. We introduce a galactic chemical evolution model DLEIY that uses an observed star formation history and metallicity distribution to reduce these confounding factors. Using a joint statistical model of the dwarf spheroidal galaxies Sculptor and Fornax, simultaneous constraints on population-averaged yields and galactic outflows are achieved with DLEIY, without fixing the absolute scale of nucleosynthetic yields. The Fe yield from core collapse supernovae is consistent with existing theoretical yield models, while the measured Mg yield is a factor of 2-4 higher, corroborating previous suggestions that yield models may under-predict [Mg/Fe]. We also find that the rate of Type Ia supernovae is enhanced by about a factor of 5 relative to field galaxies, and the delay-time distribution goes as $\\sim t^{-2}$, a much steeper relationship than that measured from supernova surveys ($\\sim t^{-1.1}$). These findings may suggest a metallicity dependence of the Type Ia rate and delay-time distribution.",

The transmission spectrum is derived by combining two transit observations, collected as part of the JWST COMPASS program. We achieved the same median transit depth precision of 37 ppm in both visits, and a median precision of 26 ppm when combining the spectroscopic light curves from the two visits. Implementing a 30-pixel-wide ($R\\sim 200$) spectroscopic binning scheme, we find that the transmission spectrum is mostly featureless, with a possible feature around 3.17 $μ$m. We assess the significance of any features in the transmission spectrum with a suite of non-parametric models, which confirm the presence of a potential feature in the NRS1 bandpass and an offset between the NRS1 and NRS2 detectors. To investigate the atmospheric composition of TOI-260 b, we run a series of PLATON retrievals. We do not detect any clear molecular signatures, but the combined data from the two visits are sufficient to constrain the atmospheric metallicity to greater than $200\\times$ solar, assuming no opaque deck $\\lesssim2.5$ mbar. We also investigate causes of the potential feature near 3.17 $μ$m; while we find some compatible gaseous species and cannot fully discard an astrophysical origin, we suspect a systematics origin due to the variance in strength and position of the feature. Overall, this look at TOI-260 b adds to the small sample of radius-valley planets, which already seem to show a diversity in their atmospheric compositions. Determining the true nature of these enigmatic planets will require a larger telescope time investment.",

We attribute the differing precisions to the lack of adequate pre-transit baseline in visit 1 from an early transit arrival caused by previously undetected transit timing variations (TTVs), hinting at a potential exterior companion. Our median JWST timing precision is 10 seconds, revealing TTVs $>$20 minutes when combined with previous TESS and CHEOPS data, highlighting JWST's TTV measurement capabilities. The transmission spectrum of HD 15337 c is featureless and can best be described by a step function with an offset between the NRS1 and NRS2 detectors, likely caused by instrumental systematics. From thermochemical equilibrium retrievals we find that, to $>$3$σ$, the data can rule out atmospheres with metallicities $<$600 or $<$310 $\\times$ solar, depending on the reduction, for opaque pressures greater than a few millibars. HD 15337 c joins other sub-Neptunes with similar masses, radii, and temperatures in possessing a featureless transmission spectrum indicative of high metallicity and/or high-altitude aerosols and adds support to recent studies showing that aerosol opacity reaches a maximum for planets with equilibrium temperatures of 500-700 K.",

    "abstract": "Large scale phenomena in spiral galaxies such as shear, supernovae, and magnetic fields all contribute to the formation and subsequent evolution of filamentary structure and star formation within them. In this paper, we analyze the properties and dynamics of filaments in a simulated Milky Way-like galaxy from Zhao et al. 2024. Using filament and superbubble structure analysis codes, we investigate the roles of galactic shear, supernovae and superbubbles, and magnetic fields on the stability and fragmentation of filaments. We find that local shear has little effect on filament stability and the largest structures at outer radii of the disk may be more likely to be dissipated by shear than supernovae. Filaments are largely parallel to the magnetic field, which plays a significant role in filament stability. By measuring the ratio of surface pressure on a filament to that on its central spine, $χ_f=P_{surf}/P_{central}$, we find that filaments with $χ_f \\le 1$ are dominated by their own self gravity and have a strong tendency to be gravitationally supercritical, whereas those with $χ_f > 1$ are either transitory or in the act of being formed. Finally, we investigate the role of ISM pressure on filament dynamics and stability as a function of galactic radius, finding considerable changes in filament stability and the accompanying star formation rates in the inner versus outer regions of the disk.",

These velocities correspond to reverse shock velocities of $\\sim$3500 and $\\sim$5900 km s$^{-1}$, respectively, in the ejecta frame of rest. Finally, we find that the IMEs are redshifted with a bulk velocity of $\\sim$360 km s$^{-1}$ while the Fe-dominated components are split: one redshifted at $\\sim$1560 km s$^{-1}$ and the other blueshifted at $\\sim$1020 km s$^{-1}$. Our results provide further support for the double-ring structure of N103B as it expands into the bipolar winds of a non-degenerate companion and highlight the strength of high-resolution spectroscopic observations of SNRs.",

    "abstract": "We present the discovery and subsequent 3.2 year monitoring campaign of the repeating fast radio burst FRB 20220529A with CHIME/FRB. We observe a gradual dispersion measure (DM) decline of $-0.881\\pm0.001~\\mathrm{pc}~\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}~\\mathrm{year}^{-1}$ ($-1.235\\pm0.001~\\mathrm{pc}~\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}~\\mathrm{year}^{-1}$ in the rest frame), implying a $\\geq3.5\\pm0.2$% decrease of the total electron column in the source environment, and we see scattering timescale variations over weeks to years.

We identify a local line-of-sight magnetic field around FRB 20220529A during this DM/RM excursion of $3.4 \\pm 0.2~\\mathrm{mG}$, corresponding to one of the most strongly magnetized FRB environments. We measure a decrease in the linear polarization fraction of FRB 20220529A bursts with decreasing frequency that we attribute to depolarization from multi-path propagation in the source environment. We also place a $5σ$ upper limit on the spectral luminosity of an associated persistent radio source of $\\leq 5\\times10^{28}~\\mathrm{erg}~\\mathrm{s}^{-1}~\\mathrm{Hz}^{-1}$ at 1.5 GHz. These observations are consistent with FRB 20220529A originating from a young ($\\sim$ years to centuries old) expanding supernova remnant, with short-lived DM and RM variability arising from interactions with the supernova remnant or with a binary companion.",

    "abstract": "This study provides a detailed examination of the structural, astrophysical, kinematic, and dynamical properties of the open clusters COIN-Gaia 24, Czernik 24, FSR 0893, and UBC 74, which are located in the direction opposite to the Galactic center. Astrometric, photometric, and spectroscopic data from the Gaia Data Release 3 catalog were used to ensure a precise characterization of cluster members and their physical properties. Membership determination was performed using the UPMASK algorithm applied to a five-dimensional parameter space, yielding 116, 179, 238, and 387 likely members for each cluster, respectively. Structural parameters were derived by fitting King profiles to the radial density distributions of high-probability members. Astrophysical parameters were estimated through Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo isochrone fitting based on PARSEC evolutionary models, complemented by spectral energy distribution analysis using ARIADNE. The resulting extinctions, distances, metallicities, and ages indicate that these are moderately reddened, intermediate-age clusters located between 1 and 3.5 kpc from the Sun. Mean radial velocities combined with Galactic orbital integrations computed with galpy show that all four clusters follow nearly circular, low-eccentricity orbits typical of thin-disc populations. All four OCs have dynamical relaxation times of 22-98 Myr. However, their ages exceed these times by several factors, particularly in Czernik 24, indicating that they are dynamically evolved systems, even though the calculated T_E values represent lower limits. The results confirm that these OCs serve as reliable tracers of the chemical and dynamical evolution of the Galactic thin disc.",

    "title": "A Morphology Catalog of Galaxies in CEERS: Evolution in the Size and Color Gradients of Galaxies Since Cosmic Dawn",
    "abstract": "We present measurements of morphological parameters from fitting 53,885 galaxies detected to a magnitude limit of F356W$< 28.5$ in the CEERS NIRCam imaging with galfit in six broadband filters: F115W, F150W, F200W, F277W, F356W, and F444W. We provide a public catalog of Sérsic index, effective semi-major axis, axis ratio, integrated magnitude, and position angle for these galaxies in each of the filters. Uncertainties in the measured parameters are estimated from simulated galaxies that have similar noise and background properties as the observed galaxies. We compare our measurements with those in the CANDELS/EGS field measured with HST/WFC3 and find that the sizes agree to within 0.09 dex and the Sérsic indices agree to within 0.13 dex. We further present the evolution in the size-mass relation, and find that the evolution to $z\\sim9$ is consistent with previous results derived at lower redshift. Finally, we look at the color gradients of galaxies at $1<z<5$ and find that for late-type galaxies ($n<2.5$), there is a strong dependence on mass, but no apparent evolution with redshift, indicating that the stellar populations and dust attenuation in more massive galaxies vary substantially with radius and contribute to significant morphological $k-$corrections. For early type galaxies ($n>2.5$), the color gradients are nearly flat with no dependence on mass, indicating that the stellar populations are more uniform throughout. The structural measurements presented are accurate to $20\\%$ or better for most galaxies with F356W $<27.0$ mag and will enable further studies of galaxy morphology to $z\\sim10$.",

    "abstract": "We revisit black hole mass estimates for high-redshift broad-line AGNs discovered with JWST by jointly analysing their broad emission lines and their systematic non-detections in deep Chandra imaging. Building upon the self-shadowed, super-Eddington accretion flow framework and the coronal over-cooling prescription of Madau & Haardt (2024), we couple funnel-dependent Comptonization physics with slim-disc spectra from Kubota & Done (2019) and explore the resulting parameter space through a full MCMC inference. Using the sample analysed by Lupi et al. (2024) and Maiolino et al. (2025), we show that X-ray weakness - manifested as extreme bolometric corrections, suppressed 2-10 keV luminosities, and non-detections in the 0.5-5 keV Chandra band - naturally arises when the corona is confined and radiatively over-cooled inside a narrow super-Eddington funnel. The combined broad line+X-ray analysis yields strongly bimodal posteriors: either very massive, very low-Eddington black holes (physically disfavoured), or a population of low-mass ($\\sim 10^{6}-10^{7} ~M_{\\odot}$) black holes accreting at $f_{\\rm Edd} \\gg 1$. The latter solution is strongly preferred for nearly all objects and returns masses consistent with, or lower than, local $M_{\\rm BH}-M_{\\rm star}$ relations, mitigating the extreme mass ratios implied by single-epoch virial estimators. The predicted intrinsic spectra are redder and exhibit reduced hard-X-ray output but higher bolometric luminosities, implying bolometric corrections larger than those typical of the local AGN population, yet consistent with low-redshift highly accreting counterparts. These results support a picture in which many JWST broad-line AGNs are powered by rapidly growing, super-Eddington black holes whose suppressed coronal emission and self-shadowed BLR geometry combine to mimic overmassive black holes at $z \\gtrsim 6$.",

    "abstract": "Low-mass dwarf galaxies ($M_{\\rm vir} \\lesssim 10^9\\rm\\ M_\\odot$) are fundamental cosmological building blocks, yet the physical processes driving their structural diversity remain poorly understood. Recent numerical simulations have suggested a diversity in the stellar-to-halo mass ratio in this halo mass range, but either the number of samples obtained from the same simulation setup or the numerical resolution was limited. We performed high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations for eight galaxies with a dark matter halo mass of $\\sim 10^9\\rm\\ M_{\\odot}$ up to $t=1.2$ Gyr at which most gas in the galaxies has been expelled. Our samples have a scatter of an order of magnitude in the halo mass at the reionization epoch. The stellar-to-halo mass ratio expected at $z=0$ scatters nearly two orders of magnitude with $5\\times10^{-5}$ to $2\\times10^{-3}$. We also observed variation in the compactness of their stellar distributions. Some of our simulated galaxies exhibit a stellar half-mass radius of $\\sim30$ pc, which is as small as that of ultra-compact dwarfs. The formation condition for such a compact stellar distribution is understood as an analog of the condition for the formation of dense, massive star clusters. We found that when the central gas surface density exceeds a critical threshold ($Σ_{\\rm gas} \\gtrsim 30\\rm\\ M_\\odot \\rm\\ {pc}^{-2}$), the star formation becomes highly efficient and results in dense stellar systems. These results suggest that UCDs can form in situ even in isolated dark matter halos.",

Different statistical measures constructed from observables probe turbulence properties in different ways. We consider a setup in which synchrotron radiation is emitted in a distant volume and then passes through a turbulent screen that induces Faraday rotation. Using both MHD simulations and synthetic turbulence spectra, we explore the spectrum of observed polarization directions measured at a single frequency as a diagnostic for recovering the statistics of turbulence in both the emitting region and the Faraday-rotation screen. We compare these results with our analytical expectations. We also compare the spectrum of polarization direction (SPD) with the wavelength-derivative diagnostic introduced and analytically explored by Lazarian \\& Pogosyan. We demonstrate that the SPD exhibits greater sensitivity to turbulence in the Faraday screen. We provide an observer-friendly criterion to determine whether the SPD samples turbulence in the synchrotron-emitting region or in the Faraday screen. These results open a practical pathway for extracting turbulence statistics from existing and forthcoming single-band radio polarimetry.",

    "abstract": "The far side of the Moon, shielded from terrestrial radio frequency interference and beyond the influence of Earth's ionosphere, should offer a uniquely quiet environment for radio astronomy and cosmological experiments. The radio sky below 30 MHz is largely unexplored and is thought to contain spectral signatures of new physics in the early, high-redshift Universe. Achieving precision measurements in this band requires accurate understanding of antenna performance and systematics. For upcoming lunar surface radio astronomy missions, this modeling will be challenging because antennas will deploy at heights that are only a small fraction of a wavelength above the lunar regolith, where strong coupling between the antenna and the surface can significantly alter impedance, radiation patterns, and efficiency. The challenge is compounded by the layered dielectric structure of the regolith and the tendency for permittivity to increase with depth, both of which are difficult to represent faithfully in numerical simulations.   In this work, we review theoretical predictions for the behavior of a simple horizontal dipole above a dielectric half-space, representing the lunar regolith, and compare them with simulation results obtained using the Ansys HFSS integral equation solver. We quantify how the antenna impedance and beam pattern couple to the sky for a representative lunar surface radio astronomy experiment. The results show that surface induced effects decrease rapidly, even for modest increases in antenna height above the regolith. Conversely, a dipole antenna placed on or very near the lunar surface will exhibit complex spectral response that renders systematics control very difficult without detailed information on regolith properties.",

    "title": "Exocometary physics: material release and tails",
    "abstract": "Despite decades of observations, the physical processes governing mass loss from small bodies beyond our Solar System remain poorly constrained. These exocomets are often treated as analogs of Solar System comet, yet the stellar environments they inhabit spans a wide range in terms of luminosity, stellar winds, and evolutionary stage, leading to potentially very diverse physical behaviors. Within our Solar System, small bodies lose material through a range of mechanisms, including sublimation, desorption, impacts, and/or sputtering. Once released, the composition and dynamics of the ejecta are then altered by additional processes, such as dust sublimation, ionization, and radiation pressure. In extrasolar systems, these mechanisms unfold under vastly different radiative and plasma conditions, leading to a rich diversity of mass-loss pathways and observable signatures.   This work reviews our understanding of the mechanisms driving mass loss from small bodies and the subsequent evolution of ejecta in diverse stellar environments. We compare the physical and chemical mechanisms that drive gas and dust production, and investigate how they scale with stellar luminosity, temperature, and activity. We then examine the processes that modify the composition of the ejecta (e.g., dust sublimation, dissociation, or ionisation) and its dynamics (e.g., radiation pressure or stellar winds). To illustrate how these processes vary across different stellar environments, we use four well-studied planetary systems as case studies: the Sun, $β$ Pictoris, AU Microscopii, and WD 1145+017. By exploring how cometary tails behave under such diverse conditions, this work provides a physical framework for interpreting exocometary activity and sheds light on why A-type stars, such as the famous $β$ Pictoris, are over-represented in the population of exocomet-hosting stars.",

    "abstract": "In low-luminosity active galactic nuclei like M87* and Sgr A*, the accretion disk around the central supermassive black hole is tenuous and collisionless. As a result, the usual ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) approximation may not be applicable. In this Letter, we report on the first fully kinetic simulations of the accretion process where the plasma initially has finite angular momentum. The simulated accretion flow behaves remarkably similarly to the magnetically arrested disk (MAD) regime of ideal MHD, reproducing episodes of magnetic flux saturation and eruption typical of MADs. The resemblance to fluid models owes largely to kinetic instabilities, which regulate pressure anisotropy in the disk, allowing fluid terms to dominate the angular momentum transfer. In addition, by handling vacuum regions effectively, our kinetic approach probes the matter supply to the jet funnel. We observe no efficient penetration of the accreting material into this region, which suggests that a pair discharge may be required to sustain the Blandford-Znajek process.",

    "abstract": "We report the discovery of strongly absorbed [OI]63um in a sample of 12 DSFGs at 4.2<z<5.8 selected from the SPT survey. This is the first systematic survey of the [OI]63um fine-structure line at z>4. Using ALMA Bands 9 and 10, we obtain spatially and spectrally resolved observations that probe the interstellar medium on sub-kpc scales. Despite reaching sensitivities 10-100x deeper than most previous studies, we detect [OI]63um in emission in only 2 sources at low significance, with the remaining galaxies yielding stringent non-detections over the full velocity range covered by robust detections of other far-infrared lines, including [CII] and [NII]205um. We identify several compact (0.05-0.2\") regions having [OI]63um absorption against the far-infrared dust continuum, some of which are possibly reaching below rest-frame CMB radiation level. We also detect narrow, spatially localised [OI]63um emission \"escape channels\" preferentially detected in regions with weak or absent dust continuum emission. We predict that similar absorption effects may appear in the [CII] line, particularly when concentrating on the regions with the densest foreground material along the line of sight. The [OI]63um line appears to be originate from a mix of compact, high optical depth [OI]63um emitting regions and sub-thermally excited, oxygen-rich molecular clouds dispersed throughout high-redshift starbursts that are capable of absorbing the ground-state line emission. Combined with a comparison to cosmological radiation hydrodynamical simulations, this supports the interpretation that regions with higher gas and dust column densities may lead to weakening an intrinsically strong [OI]63um line emission. We argue that the high [OI]63um optical depth is the dominant effect causing the strong absorption, limiting the diagnostic power of this line to trace regions of massive star formation in high-redshift DSFGs.",

    "abstract": "Newly formed stars have a profound impact on their environment by depositing energy and momentum into the surrounding gas. However, only a fraction of the stellar feedback is retained in the cloud and observational constraints are needed to further our understanding of this process. In a sample of 19 nearby galaxies, we match HII regions from PHANGS$\\unicode{x2013}$MUSE to their ionizing stellar source from PHANGS$\\unicode{x2013}$HST and measure the percentage of ionizing radiation that is leaking into the surrounding diffuse ionized gas (DIG). Based on a catalogue, where each HII region is powered by a single young and massive stellar association, we measure a photon escape fraction of $f_\\mathrm{esc}=82^{+12}_{-24}$ per cent. Comparable results are obtained when different procedures are used to match the ionized gas to its source. All samples we study contain a substantial fraction of objects (up to 20 per cent), where the stellar source is not sufficient to produce the H$α$ flux observed from the nebula. Many of them are probably related to uncertain age estimates, but we also find numerous regions, where a significant fraction of the ionizing photon budget is contributed by stars that reside outside the boundaries of the HII region. This motivates the use of an alternative galaxy-wide approach, in which we include all HII regions and stellar sources, not just the ones that show a clear overlap.

In a survey mission like Fermi, data accumulate on each source over time, so after 16 years (reached in August 2024) and twice the data for the original 4FGL sources we have more precise localization (by 24% on average). It is thus time to generate a new original catalog, which implies, beyond adding the sources newly detectable after two more years, changing the existing source names (derived from their coordinates) and reviewing the associations.

    "abstract": "Overlapping galaxies, in which a foreground galaxy partially overlaps a background galaxy, offer a unique opportunity to measure dust attenuation, a key nuisance parameter in galaxy studies, empirically and in great detail by modelling the light of both the foreground and background galaxy and inferring the missing light in the overlapping region. However, the current catalogue of overlapping pairs is relatively limited in number compared to catalogues dedicated to individual galaxies. Expanding this catalogue is not only a necessity to facilitate further detailed dust studies beyond the few limited studies conducted thus far, but also to improve pair-to-pair variance and support automated identification through machine learning techniques. To achieve this, we utilise galaxies classified as \"overlapping\" from Galaxy Zoo DECaLS (GZD-1, -2, and -5), along with images from Data Release 10 (DR10) of the DESI Legacy Survey, in our individual citizen science project to classify these pairs directly using volunteers. This new catalogue will not only provide a wealth of targets for future dust studies but will also contribute to a deeper understanding of these pairs and dust as a whole.",

The median gas disk mass and radius of the surviving disks exhibit a sharp decline in the first $0.2\\,\\mathrm{Myr}$ of evolution, followed by a slight increase that reflects survivorship bias. We also explore correlations between gas disk mass and size vs. stellar mass and FUV strength.

    "abstract": "We present results from a multi-epoch Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) survey of compact radio sources in the Orion complex, conducted within both the DYNAMO-VLBA and the GOBELINS projects. Our observations detected 216 compact radio sources, of which 58 yielded reliable multi-epoch astrometric solutions. For these sources, we derived trigonometric parallaxes and proper motions with typical precisions of about 0.05 mas and 0.10 mas yr$^{-1}$, respectively. The measured parallaxes range between 2.26 and 2.65 mas, corresponding to distances of 380 - 440 pc, and delineate the depth of the Orion star-forming complex. We determine mean distances of $405\\pm16$ pc for NGC 2068, $403\\pm5$ pc for NGC 2024, $407\\pm12$ pc for the $σ$ Orionis region, $388.5\\pm1.7$ pc for the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC), and $438\\pm12$ pc for L1641. A comparison with Gaia DR3 astrometry for 28 common sources reveals negligible mean parallax offsets ($Δ\\varpi=-0.02\\pm0.01$ mas) and small systematic differences in proper motions ($\\sim$0.07 mas yr$^{-1}$), likely due to residual rotation of the Gaia reference frame.

    "abstract": "Repeating partial tidal disruption events (pTDEs) provide a direct probe of stellar orbits and episodic mass loss around supermassive black holes, but robust identification requires multi-band and multi-epoch evidence. We investigate whether the late-time radio rebrightening of the nuclear transient IGR J12580+0134 in NGC 4845 can be explained as a repeating pTDE, using multi-epoch Karl G. Jansky VLA observations together with X-ray constraints from Swift/XRT and NICER. The radio light curves show two distinct episodes, with the L-band peaks separated by $\\approx1513$ days. Modeling the second episode with a synchrotron afterglow framework using Markov Chain Monte Carlo fitting favors a non-relativistic outflow $v\\simeq0.03c$, with an isotropic-equivalent kinetic energy of order $10^{50}$ erg propagating in an approximately constant-density circumnuclear medium. No significant contemporaneous brightening is detected by Swift/XRT during the 2016 radio flare, while faint NICER flares in 2023 suggest intermittent low-level accretion. The recurrence timescale and radio energetics therefore make IGR J12580+0134 a possible candidate for a repeating pTDE system, motivating continued sensitive radio and X-ray monitoring to test future reactivations.",

    "abstract": "We present a spectroscopic study of low-mass galaxies (LMGs;$10^8\\leq\\rm M_*/M_\\odot\\leq10^9$) at $z\\sim0.15$ in COSMOS field, and compare it to a control sample of intermediate-mass galaxies (IMGs;$10^9\\leq\\rm M_*/M_\\odot\\leq10^{10}$) at $z\\sim0.35$. We examine their star formation rates (SFRs), dust attenuation properties, and the relationship between nebular and stellar reddening. For both samples, SFRs derived from H$α$ are strongly correlated with SFRs from fitting simple star formation histories (SFHs) to the galaxies' spectral energy distributions. In fitting a joint SFR-$\\rm M_*$ relation, we obtain a slope of $\\rm {Δlog(SFR_{Hα})}/{Δlog(M_*/M_\\odot)}=1.01\\pm0.03$, indicating that fair ensembles of SFHs for galaxies at these stellar masses are well-described by scale-free, self-similar forms. We also examine their dust attenuation properties and the relationship between nebular and stellar reddening, exploring how these quantities vary with stellar mass and specific SFR (sSFR). Nebular attenuation increases with stellar mass for IMGs but is lower and less mass-dependent in LMGs, consistent with their reduced dust content. In all cases, stellar continuum attenuation is lower than nebular attenuation, as expected from the two-component dust model. The nebular-to-stellar color excess ratio in both samples is consistent with the canonical factor of 2.27. The ratio is mass-independent, but rises with sSFR in IMGs and remains constant in LMGs. These results suggest that in LMGs, efficient dispersal of birth clouds keeps the differential attenuation approximately constant across sSFR. Thus, although LMGs follow the same global SFR-$\\rm M_*$ scaling as massive galaxies, their lower dust content and feedback-maintained ISM produce distinct attenuation behavior relative to IMGs.",

    "abstract": "We present scientific and technical justifications of a potential coordinated Euclid/CSST/JPCam/JUST survey of the Euclid Deep Field North (EDF-N), aimed at probing the multi-phase circumgalactic and intergalactic medium (CGM/IGM) at the cosmic noon over ~20 deg$^2$. The survey is structured around three connected goals: (1) improving photometric redshift (photo-z) accuracy through the combination of broad- and narrow-band photometry, enabling reliable identification of large-scale structures; (2) probing extended CGM emission with dedicated narrow-band imaging; and (3) mapping foreground IGM via absorption-line spectroscopy of background galaxies. Together, these components establish an integrated observational framework to investigate galactic ecosystems -- linking galaxies to their circumgalactic and intergalactic environments -- at cosmic noon. We show that the J-PAS-like narrow-band system used in JPCam substantially improves photo-z accuracies from only the Euclid/CSST broad-band data, especially for star-forming galaxies at z~1.0-1.4. This enables the identification of galaxy groups and (proto-)clusters directly from photo-z measurements. Stacked JPCam narrow-band imaging should also detect extended [O II]-emitting CGM halos. We then construct mock 3D gas distribution model and realistic galaxy catalog, and further construct mock CSST and JUST background galaxy spectra adding Lyalpha and Mg II absorptions. The reconstructed 3D H I field from CSST Lyalpha forest reliably recovers large-scale structures; however, our simulations indicate that detecting diffuse IGM Mg II absorption with JUST is infeasible, either through spectral stacking or via the two-point correlation function method. We conclude that constraining the metallicity of the diffuse IGM will require significantly deeper and higher-resolution spectroscopy expected from future facilities such as the 39 m E-ELT.",

    "abstract": "We present the largest collisionless $N$-body cosmological simulations in a MOdified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) cosmology to date. Our 4 simulations cover $Λ$CDM as a baseline, a MOND with hot dark matter model known as $ν$HDM, and 2 unphysical models we call $Λ$HDM and $ν$CDM to test the individual contributions of hot dark matter and MOND gravity, respectively. $ν$HDM reproduces the CMB power spectrum whilst also theoretically matching cluster dynamics and preserving MOND predictions for galactic rotation curves. We test its viability on cosmological scales using simulations with $256^{3}$ particles in a box of size $800/h$ comoving Mpc. We find generically that the MOND models massively overproduce large-scale structures by $z=0$, with a most massive cluster in $ν$HDM of $\\approx 5 \\times 10^{17} M_{\\odot}/h$ and typical peculiar velocities of several thousand km/s. We also explore a local void solution to the Hubble tension in these models. Analogues to the observed \"Local Hole'' do form in the MOND models, but values for the deceleration parameter $<-1.5$ in these regions prevent a satisfactory resolution to the Hubble tension. Whilst $Λ$CDM significantly underpredicts the observed bulk flow in Cosmicflows-4, the high peculiar velocities that arise in the MOND models create the opposite problem, ruling out $ν$HDM at $>5σ$ confidence. Observations clearly require a much milder enhancement to the rate of structure growth in $Λ$CDM than is provided by the $ν$HDM paradigm. Our results also suggest that replacing cold dark matter with hot dark matter is unlikely to provide a viable cosmological model, regardless of the gravity law.",

This interaction imprints unique spectral attenuation features at very-high-energies (VHE), offering an observational probe of DPDM models. Using the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) Instrument Response Functions (IRFs), we simulate observations of VHE sources and forecast novel sensitivities to the kinetic mixing parameter for the photon-dark photon scattering process. Our study focuses on three key astrophysical targets: the Crab Nebula and the blazars Markarian 421 and Markarian 501. Additionally, we investigate the impact of dark matter spikes around black holes on the upper limits.

    "abstract": "Many small satellites in the Solar System have sub-synchronous orbits, meaning their orbits are decaying due to tidal dissipation. Unless they have substantial material strength, they will eventually tidally disrupt before reaching their planet's surface. We studied the fate of rubble-pile satellites as they migrate inward, with a particular focus on the case of Phobos. We used a combination of analytic estimates and numerical simulations to determine the failure mode and tidal disruption distance of a Phobos-like satellite, as a function of its shape and cohesive strength. Both analytically and numerically, we identify a regime for satellites with low cohesive strengths whereby their surface can be tidally stripped without undergoing internal failure. Our numerical simulations demonstrate that Phobos will be destroyed beyond 2 Mars radii if it has a bulk strength similar to those estimated for small bodies recently visited by spacecraft. Based on our results and some additional arguments, we suggest that previous studies on the fate of Phobos have overestimated its strength, and therefore underestimated its tidal disruption distance. We also speculate that if Phobos undergoes some tidal stripping, its ultimate fate may be determined by runaway collisional erosion rather than a pure tidal disruption. However, the ultimate tidal disruption distance for Phobos will depend on its unknown internal structure and bulk material properties, which will be constrained by JAXA's Martian Moons eXploration (MMX) mission and its IDEFIX rover. These results have implications for theories about the origin and evolution of the Martian moons and for tidal disruptions of other small, irregularly shaped satellites.",

    "abstract": "Cosmological simulations suggest that various galaxy properties depend on their location within the cosmic web. Yet direct observational evidence of the dependence of star formation activity on distance to filaments remains scarce and is missing at z>1. We investigate how starburst, main-sequence (MS), and quenched galaxies are distributed with respect to cosmic web filaments, and how this distribution evolves with redshift. We first use the SIMBA cosmological simulation to predict the redshift evolution of the mean distance to the closest filament from z=3 to z=0 for different galaxy populations after removing stellar-mass dependencies. We then measure the corresponding signal in the COSMOS field, using COSMOS2020 and COSMOS-Web data, where accurate photometric redshifts enable reconstruction of the projected cosmic web from z=2 to z=0.5, and starbursts are identified through far-infrared spectral energy distribution fitting. In agreement with the results from SIMBA, starburst galaxies are found closer to filaments at z>1 and at larger distances at z<1, MS galaxies occupy intermediate environments with little evolution, and quenched galaxies show progressively shorter distances to filaments toward low redshift, with a crossing between starburst and MS populations around z~1. In COSMOS-Web, the relative evolution in the average distance to filaments between starburst and MS galaxies is detected at a significance level of at least 5σ. We show that a minimal toy model in which the only environmental ingredient is the sSFR-filament distance modulation measured in simulations is sufficient to reproduce the observed differential evolution of the average filament distance between starburst and MS galaxies. These results show that the imprint of large-scale environmental effects on the star formation activity of galaxies, predicted by simulations, is detectable from z=2 down to z=0.5.",

    "title": "A deep HST view of the open cluster NGC2158: binaries, mass functions, and M-dwarf discontinuity",
    "abstract": "A significant fraction of stars in both the Galactic field and stellar clusters are members of binary systems. Understanding their properties is therefore essential for a comprehensive view of stellar structure, evolution, and cluster dynamics. Despite extensive studies of cluster binaries, key issues remain unresolved, particularly for photometric binaries among low-mass stars. While the binary fraction in the field strongly depends on stellar mass, cluster studies have generally suggested an approximately constant fraction over the limited mass ranges explored. In addition, the mass function (MF) of very low-mass stars is still poorly constrained in clusters older than a few hundred Myr. We use deep Hubble Space Telescope imaging of the intermediate-age open cluster NGC 2158 to investigate its binary population and derive the luminosity and MFs down to ~0.14 solar masses, enabling the first detailed analysis of binaries in this cluster. We measure a global binary fraction of 38%, consistent with other open clusters, and find a clear mass dependence: it decreases from ~52% at 1.0 solar masses to ~11% at 0.2 solar masses. This trend mirrors that of Galactic field stars, suggesting similar binary properties. The MF is characterized by three regimes: high-mass stars (alpha= -2.49 +- 0.19), low-mass stars (alpha= -1.11 +- 0.09), and very low-mass stars (alpha= -0.08 +- 0.07). The slope change near 1.0 solar mass agrees with recent surveys, though we find a deficit below ~0.3 solar masses. We also detect a main-sequence discontinuity around ~0.3 solar masses, possibly linked to the 3He-driven instability predicted by stellar models and analogous to the Jao Gap seen in nearby field stars.",

    "title": "The Dawes Review: A Decade of Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies",
    "abstract": "It has been 10 years since the initial discovery of Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies (UDGs) in the Coma cluster and the revelation that large, low surface brightness galaxies may constitute a greater fraction of galaxies than first thought. This left an open question: Are UDGs something special, or just an extension of the previously known dwarf galaxy population? Seeking to answer this question, in the decade following, dedicated simulations have studied and proposed a myriad of formation pathways to create UDGs. Observations have then pushed the limits of world-class observatories to perform detailed studies of these galaxies in large numbers across the full range of environments in the local Universe. These observations stress test simulations and challenge previous galaxy formation wisdom, with UDGs posing many open puzzles beyond just their unknown formation mechanism. To provide a few pertinent examples: there is observational evidence that not all UDGs follow the standard stellar mass -- halo mass relationship; there is evidence for UDGs with extraordinarily high levels of alpha enhancement; and there is evidence that some UDGs are much more globular cluster rich than other dwarfs of similar stellar mass. In this Dawes review, we undertake the task of summarising the decade of science since the discovery of UDGs. We focus on the quiescent population of UDGs and review their general properties, their proposed formation scenarios, their internal properties and their globular cluster systems. We also provide a brief conjecture on some future directions for the next decade of UDG research.",

    "abstract": "We forecast cosmological parameter constraints for a cosmic shear analysis of the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), defining an analysis framework that can accurately recover the $Λ$CDM model in the presence of astrophysical and data-related systematics. When accounting for our present uncertainty on the suppression of the non-linear matter power spectrum through baryon feedback, we find that the error on the composite parameter $S_8=σ_8\\sqrt{Ω_{\\rm m}/0.3}$ almost doubles compared to an LSST analysis which neglects this astrophysical phenomenon. After the first year of observations, LSST will extend beyond the magnitude limit of existing representative spectroscopic calibration samples, requiring photometric redshifts to be calibrated using an alternative strategy. Adopting literature measurements of the reduced redshift calibration precision found from galaxy cross-correlation techniques, combined with current levels of baryon feedback uncertainty, we forecast final year LSST cosmic shear constraints that barely improve upon the first year analysis. This forecast therefore serves as encouragement to the community to develop methodology and observations to constrain models of baryon feedback and enhance photometric redshift calibration at depths where spectroscopy is unrepresentative. With tight priors on both these systematic terms, we forecast that LSST cosmic shear can deliver constraints on $S_8$ that are more than five times as constraining as existing cosmic shear surveys.",

    "title": "The accretion discs in WZ Sge-type stars in deep quiescence. How do they outburst?",
    "abstract": "WZ Sge-type stars are an extreme subclass of dwarf novae characterised by very rare, large-amplitude superoutbursts. Within the disc instability model (DIM), such events are explained as being triggered by enhanced mass transfer from the donor star. We present an analysis of observations of a sample of WZ Sge-type systems in deep quiescence to assess the consistency of DIM predictions with their observed properties. We find that accretion discs in quiescent WZ Sge-type systems have very low mass-accretion rates of a few $\\times$$10^{-13}$ M$_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. The discs are entirely optically thin, and their physical conditions -- such as surface density and effective temperature -- remain well below the DIM thresholds required to trigger an outburst. Observationally, no increase in disc brightness is detected prior to the superoutburst, indicating the absence of a transition to an optically thick state, in contrast to DIM predictions of a gradual disc thickening preceding the instability. We therefore find no observational evidence that superoutbursts in WZ Sge-type systems are triggered by enhanced mass transfer from the donor. Furthermore, the inferred mass-transfer rates in these objects ($\\dot{M}_{\\rm tr}$~5$\\times$$10^{-12}$ M$_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$) are at least an order of magnitude lower than commonly assumed. We argue that the widely adopted value of $\\dot{M}_{\\rm tr}$ for the prototype object WZ Sge is likely overestimated. Finally, we show that in quiescence the accretion disc radius in all systems is close to the tidal truncation radius and exceeds the 3:1 resonance radius, confirming earlier results and calling into question the standard interpretation of superhump formation.",

I present pythonradex, a Python re-implementation of RADEX.

    "title": "The supersonic nature of jellyfish galaxies",
    "abstract": "All gas-rich galaxies in cluster environments are expected to experience ram-pressure stripping from the intra-cluster medium. However, only a fraction of these develop ongoing star-formation in their stripped tail, becoming the so-called ``jellyfish'' galaxies. In this work we provide observational evidence that magnetic fields can signal differences in the extraplanar star formation and explore what are the physical conditions that lead to the formation of a jellyfish galaxy. We first focus on JO147, a jellyfish galaxy that features weak star formation activity in its tail. Using MeerKAT radio continuum observations, we discover polarized emission only in a small fraction of its tail, with an average fraction of $~10\\%$, and a low Mach number $\\mathcal{M}=1.3-1.6$, which suggests a possible association between magnetic field draping, shock-compression of the gas, and extraplanar star formation activity. Then, we test this scenario in a sample of 17 jellyfish galaxies from the GASP project. We combine dynamical models for their orbits within the host clusters with realistic cluster temperature profiles to infer their Mach number, and we find a positive correlation between it and the star formation activity in their tail. We conclude that supersonic motion is a necessary condition for triggering star formation in the stripped tails of jellyfish galaxies. Our findings provide empirical evidence that the critical factor preventing the stripped gas evaporation is the shock compression induced by the supersonic motion through the cluster. This process likely enhances the magnetic field surrounding the galaxy and the properties of the stripped material.",

    "title": "Classical, large scale 3D MHD simulations of interacting pulsar wind nebulae",
    "abstract": "Magnetized rotating neutron stars, or pulsars, are a possible end product of massive star evolution. Their relativistic wind successively interacts with the supernova ejecta of their defunct progenitor, then with the circumstellar medium of the progenitor, and eventually with the interstellar medium. If a massive star is static with respect to its ambient medium, then its resulting circumstellar medium is elongated along the direction of the local magnetic field, and its supernova remnant transiently appears as a rectangle. The pulsar wind nebula forming in it is, in its turn, elongated, as long as the pulsar axis of rotation matches the direction of the local magnetization. In this work, we explore how the angle between the direction of the local magnetic field of the interstellar medium and the pulsar axis of rotation influences the shaping of its pulsar wind nebula with 3D MHD simulations are carried out with the PLUTO. We use those models to perform radiative transfer calculations to derive non-thermal radio emission maps of the pulsar wind nebulae. When the polar elongation of the pulsar develop, they bend in opposite directions under the effects of the cavity carved by the stellar wind and already filled by supernova ejecta. This induces a complex distribution of magnetized supernova ejecta and pulsar wind, resulting in various observable structures, appearing as rectangles, circles, or irregular oblong shapes, in the radio waveband. The angle between the direction of the pulsar rotation axis and that of the local ambient magnetization is a governing parameter for the shaping and non-thermal radio properties of the pulsar wind nebulae of static massive stars; however, the mixing of material, once the pulsar wind nebula is old (50 to 80 kyr), is not strongly affected by that factor.",

    "abstract": "Dust grains and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) actively contribute to the thermodynamics, chemistry, and radiative state of the interstellar medium (ISM), yet most ISM models and galaxy simulations either exclude them altogether or adopt simplified treatments. We present CALIMA, a new module for dust and PAH formation and evolution in radiation-hydrodynamics simulations for RAMSES, designed to self-consistently couple dust physics to radiative transfer and non-equilibrium thermochemistry in a multiphase ISM. The model employs a two-size, two-composition dust framework with log-normal grain populations, explicitly evolving stellar dust injection, turbulence-informed gas-phase accretion, shattering, coagulation, thermal and non-thermal sputtering, and shock destruction, while PAHs are separate components with their own evolution. The evolving dust populations and radiation field determine local, wavelength-dependent opacities, photoelectric heating efficiencies, grain-assisted recombination, dust-gas collisional heating/cooling, and H$_2$ formation on both grains and PAHs. Updated treatments of thermal sputtering and collisional cooling that include finite grain sizes and modern ion-solid physics reduce sputtering rates at high temperatures and extend the regime where dust significantly cools hot gas. One-zone ISM tests show that dust and PAH evolution modifies classical thermal phase diagrams and C-bearing chemistry, while isolated disc galaxy simulations reveal environment-dependent variations in dust-to-metal ratio, small-to-large grain ratio, PAH fraction, and interstellar radiation field intensity that drive non-trivial structure in infrared emission, UV transparency, and H$_2$ formation. CALIMA provides a physically motivated framework to interpret dust- and PAH-based observables and to assess dust-mediated feedback in galaxy formation across cosmic time.",

We use the exponential bar growth timescale, $τ_{\\rm bar}$, to quantify how disc structure and kinematics regulate the onset and rate of secular bar formation. We extend previous work to thicker and more turbulent discs, motivated by those observed at high redshift ($z>1$). By revisiting several commonly used disc stability criteria - the Efstathiou-Lake-Negroponte parameter ($ε_{\\rm ELN}$), the Ostriker-Peebles ratio ($t_{\\rm OP}$), and the disc stellar mass fraction within 2.2 disc scale radii ($f_{\\rm disc}$) - we find that $τ_{\\rm bar}$, when expressed in terms of the disc's orbital period, follows a tight power law with each criteria.

    "abstract": "QU-fitting is a powerful tool for interpreting spectro-polarimetric radio continuum observations by linking them to physical models, enabling estimates of the magnetic fields in, for example, the Milky Way, galaxy clusters, and radio jets. We present a comprehensive investigation into the effectiveness and limitations of QU-fitting within the ASKAP POSSUM survey frequency ranges (800-1088 MHz and 1296-1440 MHz) with projections to other spectro-polarimetric radio observations. We simulate different physical polarization sources: Faraday simple, Burn slab, internal turbulence, external turbulence, and two-component models in the POSSUM frequencies, and assess their observational degeneracies and fit accuracies. Our results highlight the model-dependent nature of reliable fitting and identify specific regions of parameter space where model selection, and therefore characterization of the physical medium, becomes ambiguous. For QU-fitting we find the Bayes factor, computed using the marginal likelihood, outperforms more traditionally used goodness-of-fit metrics such as Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), and chi-squared for model selection. We provide empirical relationships to delineate the boundaries where model distinguishability is impossible. Finally, we evaluate how accurately QU-fitting recovers model parameters and their associated uncertainties, thereby assessing its ability to correctly characterize the Faraday-rotating medium in both point and extended sources in Faraday depth space.",

Removing the dependency on the sound horizon with a rescaling procedure at the matter power spectrum level, we analyse the BOSS full-shape power spectrum and bispectrum (for the first time) using the effective field theory of large-scale structure up to one loop. We combine this analysis with the auto- and cross-angular power spectra from the DESI Legacy Imaging Survey DR9, the $3 \\times 2$pt analysis from DES Y3, and the CMB gravitational lensing power spectrum from Planck PR3. Our baseline analysis, that does not rely on supernovae data, yields $h = 0.702^{+0.022}_{-0.024}$, $Ω_m = 0.310 \\pm 0.013$, and $σ_8 = 0.799 \\pm 0.020$, corresponding to $3-4 \\%$ precision measurements. When adding supernovae data from Pantheon+, we obtain a $2.6 \\%$ measurement of $h$, with $h = 0.686 \\pm 0.018$. We further note that our EFTBOSS analysis indicates a slight deviation of the BAO scale parameter (at $1.8 σ$) from its $Λ$CDM value, caused by the small scales of the bispectrum. We finally use the sound horizon-free EFTBOSS analysis as a diagnosis for the presence of new physics, finding that our results are consistent with the recent hints of evolving dark energy.",

    "abstract": "Stellar flares are sudden brightenings caused by magnetic reconnection and are frequently observed on late-type stars. High-cadence photometry of flares provides valuable insights into the mechanisms of these events, yet such observations remain scarce. We seek to explore the sub-second fine structure of stellar flares and assess the information content in high-speed photometry. New 0.3 s-cadence photometry from a six-year-long observing campaign of the active M-dwarf AD Leo is presented. We use time--frequency analysis to detect quasi-periodic pulsations in the decay phase of flares. We explore statistical measures of time series complexity of the detected flares to quantify the information gain achievable with high-cadence photometry. We detect 42 flares in 211 hours of observations. The flare frequency distribution is consistent with the previous literature. We find no quasi-periodic pulsations with periods below a few seconds, and identify two candidate signals with periods around 1 and 3 min. Using different measures of complexity on the binned flare light curves we confirm the advantages of high observing cadence. However, we also find a plateau up to a binning of ~4--5 s for a few complex flares, suggesting that an exposure time of a few seconds is usually enough to retain most of the information carried by a single-filter observation. New photometric observations of AD Leo revealed sub-structures of flare light curves on the timescale of a few seconds, but we found no features on timescales below that.",

The observed peak-to-peak amplitude of the flickering is 0.11-0.28 mag in B band. For the flickering source we find luminosity in the range 0.10-0.46 L_sun. Using the amplitude-flux relation, we estimate an average luminosity of the accretion disc L_d = 0.91 +/- 0.28 L_sun.   Assuming that the white dwarf accretes material through Wind Roche Lobe Overflow (WRLOF), we find that Mira B is a low mass white dwarf with M_wd = 0.24 +/- 0.04 M_sun accreting at a rate 6.8x10^{-9} M_sun/yr. This value of the mass is in the range of the extremely low mass white dwarfs.   The data are available on Zenodo: zenodo.org/records/18756532",

    "title": "Retarded Stellar Dynamo in Tidally Deformed M Dwarfs",
    "abstract": "Current studies of stellar dynamos primarily focus on spherical stars, leaving their behavior in distorted stars largely unexplored. We utilize stars of varying distortions to examine the relation between stellar cycle periods ($P_{\\rm cyc}$) and rotational periods ($P_{\\rm rot}$), which are closely linked to dynamo processes. By analyzing a sample of tidally distorted M dwarfs in cataclysmic variables, we identify an anti-correlation between $P_{\\rm cyc}$ and $P_{\\rm rot}$, in contrast to the lack of such a relation in single M dwarfs. This means that stars with greater deformation have longer cycle periods, suggesting variations in dynamo behavior under non-spherical geometries. Our numerical simulations further reveal that, the thermal convection weakens in highly distorted stars, and subsequently, the differential rotation is also reduced. These effects may lengthen the conversion timescale between poloidal and toroidal magnetic fields, potentially explaining the newly discovered $P_{\\rm cyc}$-$P_{\\rm rot}$ relation in cataclysmic variables.",

    "title": "AVID: A Near-Major Post-Merger of Late-Type Dwarfs beneath a Regularly Rotating HI Disk (VCC 693)",
    "abstract": "On the periphery of galaxy clusters, moderately high galaxy densities and velocity dispersions favour interactions and mergers that influence galaxy evolution prior to cluster infall. Observational studies of this phase in dwarfs remain rare. We present a high-resolution study of the merger remnant VCC 693 in the outskirts of Virgo cluster, using observations from the Atomic gas in Virgo Interacting Dwarf galaxies (AVID) project. We explore the origin of VCC 693 and the consequences of the merger on its star formation and structure through a joint analysis of VLA and FAST HI emission line observations, together with complementary optical imaging and spectroscopy. We employ hydrodynamical simulations to help interpret the observations. Our analysis favours a near-major merger between two dwarfs with a stellar mass ratio of 3:1-4:1, with one likely gas-poor progenitor (i.e., a damp merger). The optical appearance of VCC 693 is dominated by complex tidal structures throughout the system, whereas the HI gas has settled to a regular rotating disk. Compared with similar-mass dwarfs, the central star formation and gas-phase metallicity are moderately enhanced. The global star formation rate, HI gas content, and HI-to-optical size ratio of VCC 693 are broadly consistent with those of typical dwarfs of similar mass, albeit somewhat lower. Decomposition of the HI rotation curve into baryonic and dark matter indicates a high halo concentration, suggesting post-merger relaxation into a more centrally peaked configuration. Together with two recent studies of AVID post-merger systems, these results support the view that even major dwarf mergers can produce remnants with overall stellar structures indistinguishable from ordinary dwarfs, and that the environmental effects in cluster outskirts can promote damp or mixed mergers, constituting an integral part of galactic pre-processing.",

    "abstract": "We present results from coordinated multiwavelength observations of the SS 433, obtained with XRISM, optical telescopes, and near-infrared camera during 2024 April and 2025 March. The XRISM exposures amounted to ~200 ks in 2024 and ~100 ks in 2025. With XRISM/Resolve's high spectral resolution and large effective area, we clearly resolved numerous emission lines even in short time segments, achieving improved accuracy in Doppler-shift measurements relative to earlier observations. The simultaneously obtained X-ray and optical Doppler shifts suggest a possible tendency for the optical emission to lag slightly behind the X-rays. In the Resolve data, the Doppler shifts of the two jet components exhibited apparent asymmetries, with jet speeds fluctuating around ~0.26$\\pm$0.01$c$ in 2024 and ~0.30$\\pm$0.01$c$ in 2025. The velocity variations indicated modulations on a timescale of ~6.3 d, with a phase offset of about -90$^{\\circ}$ relative to the nutation cycle. The observed line widths and flux of the approaching and receding jets appear consistent with the expected geometrical effects, indicating systematically larger line widths in the inner regions of the jets, as proposed by Shidatsu et al. (2025). Optical light curves show flares of ~400 s in 2024 and ~1600 s in 2025, with amplitudes up to ~15% during out-of-eclipse intervals, while the XRISM/Xtend light curves show no significant variability within the overlapping intervals and given the statistical uncertainties. Near-infrared photometry in 2024, obtained during an out-of-eclipse interval at a different epoch from the optical observations, showed no flare-like variability, and the X-ray band also remained constant within uncertainties. These coordinated observations provide a foundation for future XRISM studies aimed at probing the dynamical properties of the relativistic jets in SS 433.",

    "title": "$r$-mode stabilization in rotating hyperon-rich neutron stars and its implications for GW190814",
    "abstract": "The GW190814 event, involving a black hole of mass $22.2$--$24.3 M_{\\odot}$ and a compact object of mass $2.50$--$2.67 M_{\\odot}$, challenges our understanding of the mass gap between the heaviest neutron stars and the lightest black holes. If the secondary is a neutron star exceeding $2.5 M_{\\odot}$, hyperons are likely to appear in its core, softening the equation of state. Rapid rotation can offset some of this softening, enabling higher maximum masses, but it may simultaneously excite the Chandrasekhar--Friedman--Schutz $r$-mode instability. Bulk viscosity arising from nonleptonic weak interactions in hyperonic matter provides an efficient damping mechanism that can stabilize such configurations. In this work, we investigate the combined effects of rotation, thermal evolution, and hyperon-induced bulk viscosity on the stability of massive neutron stars. We demonstrate a direct connection between the suppression of $r$-mode instabilities and the long-term dynamical stability of hyperon-rich stars, offering a plausible interpretation of the GW190814 secondary as a rapidly rotating, hyperon-rich neutron star rather than a low-mass black hole. Our unified framework extends beyond previous studies restricted to static equations of state or extreme viscous damping assumptions, providing new insights into the stability of massive, exotic neutron star configurations.",

Both events show optical precursors consistent with shock dissipation from stream self-intersection. Their X-ray emission is luminous ($L_{\\rm X}\\sim 10^{44}\\,{\\rm erg\\,s^{-1}}$), highly variable (with minimum observed variability timescales of 1.3\\,hr and 4.8\\,hr for factor of $\\sim3$ flux changes), long-lasting ($>1\\,\\rm yr$), emerging no later than the optical peak, and well characterized by power-laws with $1.7<Γ<3$ (where $f_ν\\propto ν^{1-Γ}$). The X-ray properties and radio non-detections support a compact corona ($\\lesssim 10 r_{\\rm g}$) producing Comptonized X-ray emission. Using all published featureless TDEs, we find statistically significant bimodality in the distribution of their peak UV/optical blackbody luminosities and radii. We assemble a comparison TDE sample with early-time X-ray observations with eROSITA, in which we find different $M_{\\rm BH}$ distributions in TDEs with different X-ray spectral evolution properties: low-mass black holes ($M_{\\rm BH} \\sim 10^6 M_\\odot$) remain soft ($Γ>4$) within $t\\lesssim 2$\\,yr, intermediate masses ($\\sim 10^7 M_\\odot$) transition from soft to hard at $\\sim$1 yr, while high masses ($\\sim 10^8 M_\\odot$) are hard ($1.5<Γ\\lesssim 3$) from the outset. We interpret this result as evidence that the soft-to-hard state transition in TDEs occurs at the critical threshold of $\\dot{M}_{\\rm acc} \\sim 0.03 \\dot M_{\\rm Edd}$ (similar to X-ray binaries), using the fact that the transition timescale predicted by simple disk theory scales with black hole mass as $t_{\\rm tr}\\propto M_{\\rm BH}^{-3/4}$.",

    "abstract": "HATPI is a recently commissioned time-domain facility at Las Campanas Observatory, Chile, that uses 64 wide-angle, 9.6 cm diameter lenses and back-illuminated CCDs, yielding a mosaic field-of-view of 7,100 square arcdegrees, observing the night sky at a cadence of 45 s and a spatial scale of 19.7 arcsec pixel$^{-1}$. In this paper, we present moving object time-series photometry with this facility, focusing on the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS. 3I/ATLAS was first robustly recovered by HATPI on the night of 2025 July 2 (one night after its discovery) at a Gaia $G$-band magnitude of $G = 17.796 \\pm 0.082$ mag ($\\pm 0.030$ mag systematic uncertainty). The comet then increased in brightness to $G = 14.071 \\pm 0.073$ mag $\\pm 0.030$ mag by 2025 Sep 13, after which it became unobservable by HATPI as it approached perihelion. Before 3I/ATLAS achieved a brightness of $G = 16.396 \\pm 0.029$ mag $\\pm 0.030$ mag on 2025 Aug 6, it could be detected when stacking all HATPI observations from a single night, while after this date it is sufficiently bright to detect in individual 45 s exposures. We do not detect evidence for significant short-time-scale variations in the brightness of 3I/ATLAS after Aug 6. Compared to other light curves in the literature, the HATPI photometry exhibits a somewhat steeper rise in brightness with decreasing heliocentric distance, $r_{H}$. The HATPI magnitudes are well-fit as a power law function of $r_{H}$, with an exponential index of $n = 5.167 \\pm 0.095$, over the range $2.14$ AU $ < r_{H} < 4.44$ AU, compared to $n = 3.94 \\pm 0.10$ when fitting together with other literature observations. We find that the phase function is constrained to $β= 0.0552 \\pm 0.0032$ mag deg$^{-1}$.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the gas motions in the core region of the Abell~3395 South subcluster (A3395S) using high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy with XRISM/Resolve. By analyzing the Fe~XXV He$α$ emission line, we directly measure the line-of-sight bulk and turbulent velocities of the intracluster medium. We find that the one-dimensional turbulent velocity is low, at the level of $124\\pm21~{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}}$, while a significant line-of-sight bulk velocity of $263\\pm23~{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}}$ is detected. The coexistence of low turbulence and finite bulk motion suggests that A3395S has not yet reached a dynamically relaxed state. These results are consistent with the non-detection of a radio halo in A3395S, implying that turbulent particle reacceleration is currently inefficient in the cluster core. This study demonstrates that high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy with XRISM provides a powerful means to directly constrain intracluster medium dynamics in merging galaxy clusters, and it provides a reference for future comparative studies of A3395N and A3391 within the same large-scale structure.",

    "abstract": "High-resolution tri-axial simulations are indispensable for realistically co-modeling the dynamical signatures and the radiative fingerprints of astrophysical jets, which are becoming increasingly important in modern computational studies of jet physics. However, such simulations impose extreme computational requirements that often exceed the capabilities of conventional CPU-based codes. GPU-accelerated simulations offer a transformative solution to mitigate these limitations. In this work, we present a detailed performance benchmarking of the recently developed GPU-enabled PLUTO code (gPLUTO), demonstrating runtime speed-ups ranging from an order of magnitude to (approximately) over 30 relative to CPU-only configurations. A direct comparison between computations of extragalactic jet propagation performed at different grid resolutions confirm the physical fidelity and production readiness of the gPLUTO code, while underscoring the importance of resolving the jet radius adequately to capture the jet dynamics accurately. Leveraging GPU-PLUTO's capabilities, we finally present an application by performing high-resolution simulations of giant radio galaxy jets (GRGs $\\gtrsim 1$ Mpc), representing the first such well-resolved 3D study to our knowledge (resolving scales down to 500 pc). These simulations probe a range of environmental effects on GRG jets, clarifying their formation from central galaxies within host cosmic structures, rapid peripheral expansion, and the development of asymmetric cocoon morphologies.",

    "abstract": "IceCube has detected neutrino emission from the Galactic Plane (GP) at a significance of $4.5σ$, though its origin remains uncertain. Utilizing ten years of IceCube muon-track data, we investigate potential correlations between the GP neutrinos and $γ$-ray sources in the first LHAASO catalog (1LHAASO). To avoid issues caused by spectral extrapolation, this analysis focuses on sources detected by the Water Cherenkov Detector Array (WCDA). We employ an unbinned likelihood analysis to search for neutrino emission and constrain the hadronic $γ$-ray component of these sources. Neither single-source searches nor stacking analyses reveal significant neutrino signals. The stacking analysis indicates that the 1LHAASO WCDA population contributes at most $\\sim$20\\% to the diffuse GP neutrino flux measured by IceCube. The total hadronic contribution to the cumulative $γ$-ray emission from all WCDA sources is constrained to be at most $\\sim$$60\\%$, suggesting a predominantly leptonic origin for the $γ$-ray emission from the LHAASO source population. Even accounting for unresolved sources below the detection threshold, we estimate the total neutrino flux from all discrete sources (resolved plus unresolved) reaches at most about 40\\% of the observed GP neutrino flux. These results support that the bulk of the GP neutrino emission is mainly from truly diffuse processes, i.e., cosmic-ray interactions with the interstellar medium, rather than from unresolved point sources.",

    "title": "Short-duration GRB 250221A Afterglow Driven by Two-Component Jets from merger of compact star",
    "abstract": "GRB 250221A is a short gamma-ray burst (GRB) at redshift $z=0.768$, with a duration of 1.8 s and no extended emission in either Swift/BAT or Konus-Wind bands. A remarkable re-brightening feature in both optical and X-ray bands was observed at $\\sim 0.6$ days after the burst trigger, but no supernova or kilonova signature was detected. The burst properties and empirical correlations or distributions (e.g., duration, spectral hardness, location in the Amati correlation, $\\varepsilon-$value, $f_{\\rm eff}$ parameter, and physical offset) favor a compact binary merger origin. However, a dense circumburst medium with $n\\sim 80\\rm~cm^{-3}$, obtained by adopting the energy injection into a jet to interpret the late-time re-brightening is inconsistent with the compact binary merger origin. In this paper, we propose a two-component jet model to explain the multiwavelength afterglow observations of GRB 250221A, in which the relativistic narrow jet ($\\rm θ_{c} \\sim 3.8^\\circ$) produces the prompt and the early decay afterglow emission, while the mildly relativistic wide jet ($\\rm θ_{w} \\sim 4.4^\\circ$) dominates at later times, resulting in the observed re-brightening feature. If this is the case, one can obtain a lower medium density with $n\\sim 0.72\\rm~cm^{-3}$ which is a little bit higher than that of short GRBs in merger environments, but falls into the reasonable and acceptable range. Finally, a possible kilonova emission is also discussed within the scenario of compact star merger origin of GRB 250221A.",

    "title": "Conditional Image Diffusion with Interferometric Closure Invariants: Independent EHT Imaging of Centaurus~A and 3C~279",
    "abstract": "We present independent imaging analyses of Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of the active galactic nuclei in radio galaxy Centaurus~A and quasar 3C~279 using Generative Deep learning Image Reconstruction with Closure Terms (GenDIReCT), a recently developed machine-learning framework built on conditional diffusion models that uses interferometric closure invariants as primary observables. For Centaurus~A, our reconstruction reveals two prominent emission ridges ($\\simeq 80\\,μ$as each) along the jet sheath with a brightness ratio of $1.4\\pm 0.1$ and an opening angle of $12.3\\pm 0.3$~deg. For 3C~279, we identify three distinct components in the image, with the southern jet ejecta on sub-parsec scale exhibiting a proper motion of $4.6\\pm 1.0\\,μ$as over $\\approx 5.39$ days away from the northern components, corresponding to an apparent superluminal velocity of $\\simeq 10\\pm 2$ times light speed. These measurements are consistent with those reported by the EHT Collaboration. The results are significant because we demonstrate that: (1) imaging from interferometric aperture synthesis data, especially in VLBI and most acutely in extremely sparse arrays like the EHT, remains a severely ill-posed and challenging inverse problem, yet closure invariants preserve robust morphological information that can strongly constrain structural features, and (2) more importantly, closure-invariant imaging largely avoids calibration systematics, thus providing a fundamentally independent view of spatial structure with very high angular resolution. The generative nature of GenDIReCT further allows us to sample and characterise clusters of plausible image solutions for each dataset. As a calibration-independent, generative imaging approach, GenDIReCT offers a robust and truly independent blind-imaging tool for current and future VLBI experiments.",

    "title": "A Decade-Long Increasing Mid-Infrared Luminosity in Galaxy NGC6447: a Turning-On Candidate of Active Galactic Nucleus",
    "abstract": "It is widely expected that the obscured accretion stage can be the initial turning-on stage of active galactic nuclei from quiescent galaxies. We present mid-infrared light curves of NGC 6447 in 3.5$μ$m and 4.6 $μ$m bands observed by WISE/NEOWISE, which show an almost monotonic increasing trend of 1.2 mag over 14 years. The optical light curve from ASAS-SN during the same period is consistent with a constant showing no variability. The mid-infrared color evolution shows that the galaxy transitioned into an active galactic nucleus (AGN) in 2018. The SPHEREx spectrum reveals an increasing continuum resembling warm to hot dust emission from an AGN. NuSTAR detected an X-ray source with a 2-30 keV luminosity of $8.4\\times10^{41}$ ergs/s at the lower boundary of AGN X-ray emission range, and a factor of >7 variability in one year compared to the Swift upper limit. NGC 6447 was classified as a quiescent galaxy in the literature. The multi-wavelength timing and spectral properties of NGC 6447 are consistent with the expected AGN turning on event, where the obscuring material around the AGN central engine is gradually dispersed, revealing the central engine. This example shows that long-term infrared variability can be a powerful tool to find similar sources. Based on the sample selection statistics, we estimate the duration of the episodes of AGN accretion (duty cycle) signified by the turning-on event as $10^4$-$10^6$ yr.",

    "title": "Revisiting the Origin of the Star-Forming Main Sequence Based on a Volume-Limited Sample of ~25,000 Galaxies",
    "abstract": "We revisit the extensively debated star-forming main sequence (SFMS)-a tight correlation between the star formation rate and stellar mass in both kiloparsec-resolved and integrated galaxies. We statistically explore the fundamental drivers of star formation at global scales, using a large volume-limited sample of 24,954 local star-forming galaxies to overcome the limitations of previous works. Based on the mid-infrared 12 micron luminosity, stellar mass, and g-r color, we estimate the molecular gas mass for the considered sample. At galaxy-wide scales, we establish global relations between the surface densities of the star formation rate, stellar mass, and molecular gas mass . These global density relations are connected with and follow similar trends as the resolved SFMS, the Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relation, and the molecular gas main sequence (MGMS). Taking advantage of this large catalog, we show that the scatters in the global KS and MGMS relations are smaller than that of the global relation between the star formation rate surface density and stellar mass surface density, and their Pearson correlation coefficients are higher. More importantly, multivariate regression and partial correlation analyses demonstrate that the apparent correlation between the star formation rate surface density and stellar mass surface density is entirely mediated by the molecular gas surface density, with its best-fit parameters directly derivable from those of the KS and MGMS relations. Overall, our findings suggest that the correlation between stellar mass and molecular gas, as well as that between molecular gas and star formation, are more direct and fundamental. The star-forming main sequence thus appears to be a natural by-product of these two tighter relations.",

    "title": "Intracluster Medium Fluctuations on Scales up to 1 Mpc: A Combined eROSITA and SPT/Planck Analysis of Abell 3266",
    "abstract": "Galaxy clusters form through hierarchical assembly, where smaller substructures merge to build the largest gravitationally bound objects in the universe. These mergers, combined with feedback from AGN, filamentary accretion, and other energy injection processes, generate turbulence and perturbations within the intra-cluster medium (ICM). X-ray and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) observations can be utilized to measure these ICM density and pressure inhomogeneities, in turn providing constraints on the effective Equation of State (EOS) of the perturbations and ICM velocities. In this work, we analyze deep SRG-eROSITA and Planck/SPT observations of Abell 3266 (A3266), a dynamically complex merging cluster with elongated morphology and significant substructure. We measure pressure and density fluctuations, and compute the power spectra and deprojected 3D amplitudes of these perturbations. We estimate the ratio of pressure-to-density fluctuation amplitudes as $1.00 \\pm 0.55$ and non-thermal pressure support $0.068 \\pm 0.050$. Density fluctuations are found to be stronger in the northern sector of the cluster compared to the south, consistent with ongoing accretion along a filamentary structure revealed by eROSITA. Further, we find the amplitude of density fluctuations increases with radius, qualitatively consistent with the trend found in cosmological simulations. Uncertainties in our results are dominated by the relatively low sensitivity of current Planck/SPT data, suggesting that improvements in SZ data quality could substantially improve our understanding of ICM energy injection, transport, and dissipation from this technique.",

    "abstract": "Type Ia supernovae are bright thermonuclear explosions that are important to numerous areas of astronomy. However, the origins of these events are poorly understood. One proposed setting is that of a near Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf that undergoes runaway carbon burning in the core. During the thousand years leading up to the explosion, the white dwarf undergoes a simmering phase where slow carbon burning heats the core and drives convection. A poorly understood aspect of this phase is the convective Urca process, which links convection with weak nuclear reactions. We use the low Mach number code MAESTROeX to perform full 3D simulations as is required to accurately capture the turbulent convection. We present simulations with and without the A=23 convective Urca process, which have relaxed to a steady state. We characterize the effects of the convective Urca process on the neutrino losses, the nuclear energy generation, and the convective boundary. We find that the size of the convection zone is substantially reduced by the convective Urca process, though convection still extends past the Urca shell. Our findings on the structure of the convective zone and the compositional changes can be used to inform 1D stellar models that track the longer-timescale evolution.",

    "abstract": "Context. Stellar ages are typically very difficult to estimate for field stars. New empirical methods, based on abundance ratios of chemical elements, are emerging and need to be calibrated. Aims. Our main aim is to contribute to revealing relations between [C/N] and [Y/Mg] ratios and stellar ages by determining astroseismic ages and non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) abundances, and accounting for stellar evolutionary stages and birth places in the Galaxy. Methods. We searched for solar pulsations in a sample of 1250 bright F, G, and K giants using data from the TESS space telescope and determined asteroseismic ages using the BASTA and PARAM codes. For the [Y/Mg] relations with age, we determined abundances accounting for deviations from the local thermodynamic equilibrium. For the [C/N] relations with age, we separated stars according to their evolutionary stages. Results. We determined asteroseismic ages for 218 giants and derived [Y/Mg] and [C/N] relations with age for subsamples of stars in three regions of the Galactic thin disc and the thick disc. Conclusions. The [Y/Mg]-age relation exhibits a clear radial dependence across the Galactic disc, with a steeper trend in the outer disc, progressively flatter relations towards the inner disc, and a very flat trend in the thick disc. NLTE abundances of Mg and especially of Y have to be used in order to obtain a more precise stellar age evaluation from [Y/Mg] ratios. When using [C/N] abundance ratios as stellar age indicators, evolutionary stages of stars have to be taken into account.",

    "abstract": "The detection of ultra-high energy neutrinos (UHE-$ν$), with enegies above 10 PeV, has been a long-time goal in astroparticle physics. Autonomous, radio-frequency (RF) UHE-$ν$ detetectors have been deployed in polar regions that rely on the Askaryan effect in ice for the neutrino signal. The Askaryan effect occurs when the excess negative charge within a UHE-$ν$ cascade radiates in a dense medium. UHE-$ν$ can induce cascades that radiate in the RF bandwidth above thermal backgrounds. To identify UHE-$ν$ signals in data from Askaryan-class detectors, analytic models of the Askaryan electromagnetic field have been created and matched to simulations and laboratory measurements. These models describe the Askaryan electromagnetic field, but leave the effects of signal propagation through polar ice and RF channel response to simulations. In this work, a fully analytic Askaryan model that accounts for these effects is presented. First, formulas for the observed voltage trace and its Hilbert envelope are calculated. Second, the analytic model is compared to UHE-$ν$ signals at 100 PeV from NuRadioMC, a key Monte Carlo toolset in the field. Correlation coefficients between the analytic signal envelope and MC data in excess of $0.94$ are found, and 99.99% of UHE-$ν$ signals pass a correlation threshold of $ρ\\geq 0.4$. Analysis of RF thermal noise reveals that just 0.2 background events have $ρ\\geq 0.4$ in 5 years at a 1 Hz thermal trigger rate. Finally, we describe future work related to the measurement of the logarithm of the UHE-$ν$ cascade energy.",

    "abstract": "We present spatially resolved measurements of turbulence driving modes across entire extragalactic discs of NGC7793 and NGC1313, using Atacama Large Millimetre/submillimetre Array (ALMA) CO(J=2-1) observations at 13pc resolution. By applying a kernel-based analysis of density and velocity fluctuations, we map the turbulence driving parameter, b, which characterises the balance between solenoidal ($b\\sim0.3$) and compressive ($b\\sim1$) turbulent driving regimes. b is quantified as the ratio of the turbulent density fluctuations relative to the turbulent sonic Mach number, M. Both galaxies show predominantly solenoidal driving on average for the regions where we find valid results ($b\\geq 0.33(\\pm 0.05)^{+0.14}_{-0.10}$ in NGC7793; $b\\geq 0.24(\\pm 0.03)^{+0.10}_{-0.07}$ in NGC1313), noting that this is without including the influences of magnetic fields, making these measurements lower limits. We find substantial spatial variation of b, including localised regions of strongly compressive driving. NGC1313 exhibits higher turbulent Mach numbers and density dispersions than NGC7793, consistent with the disturbed morphology and recent satellite interaction in NGC1313. The turbulence in both NGC7793 and NGC1313 is supersonic ($3\\lesssim M\\lesssim 20$), and NGC1313 shows a radially decreasing trend of M with galactocentric radius. Radial trends indicate more solenoidal driving in the galaxy centres, potentially reflecting enhanced shear, and increasingly compressive modes in the outskirts. These results demonstrate that turbulence driving varies systematically with galactic environment and cannot be assumed uniform across discs. Our study applies a previously established method to larger scales and new data, linking local turbulence physics to global star formation regulation in galaxies, providing a new avenue for testing theoretical models with future integral field units and ALMA surveys.",

    "title": "Formation of Water-rich Giant Planet Satellites at Decretion Disk Ice Lines",
    "abstract": "The volatile budgets of giant planet satellites are critical to unraveling the origin of their building blocks within the circumplanetary disks that hosted them. The Galilean moons Ganymede and Callisto, as well as the Saturnian moon Titan, are known to be anomalously water rich on the basis of their mean densities and interior models informed by gravity data from Galileo and Cassini, characterized by ice-to-rock ratios around unity. Here, we show that the water-ice sublimation line in a decreting circumplanetary disk lends itself to the formation of a water-rich solid reservoir, serving as a natural site for the birthplace of icy satellites. Fundamentally, this reflects how interior to the ice line, water vapor is advected outward, while beyond it, water ice drifts inward as pebbles. Using a semi-analytic model for dust and vapor evolution, we simulate vapor and ice accumulation at the ice line, showing that solids just beyond it achieve steady-state ice-to-rock ratios a factor of a few higher than elsewhere in the disk. For typical disk parameters, this ice buildup occurs within a timescale of a few thousand years. We propose this as a first-order process that explains, at least to some extent, the compositions of three aforementioned satellites. We explore the impact of uncertain turbulence parameters on our results, namely the turbulent Schmidt number and Shakura-Sunyaev alpha, before discussing them in the context of icy satellite D/H ratios. We conclude by evaluating alternative scenarios for explaining water-rich satellites, based on the conversion of CO to CH4, with water as a by-product.",

    "abstract": "The spacings of super-Earths in multi-transiting systems exhibit a distribution that is broad and mostly featureless, with the exception of notable excesses of planet pairs situated a few percent wide of first-order mean motion resonances (MMRs). In this work, we extend the so-called \"breaking-the-chains\" model to account for both of these characteristics. Assuming that super-Earths are settled into stable chains of resonances after disk-driven migration, we show that scattering a planetesimal population that contains only a few percent of a system's mass can reorganize primordial chains in remarkable ways. The planetesimal scattering \"rattles\" the chains by repelling adjacent planet pairs wide of their initial MMRs. Some chains remain rattled but otherwise intact and make up the observed excesses wide of MMRs. In other systems, however, this initial rattling sows the seeds of later orbital instabilities that break the chains entirely. If individual planetesimals' masses are of order a Pluto mass or so, the onset of these instabilities can occur tens or hundreds of Myr after birth, naturally explaining the apparent disappearance of near-resonant pairs on this timescale. The origin of such Pluto-mass debris is currently unknown.",

It is attributable to depolarization induced by Radiative Torque Disruption (RAT-D) of large grains and a modest contribution from magnetic-field tangling. The local magnetic field towards the cluster's central region is significantly misaligned with both the large-scale Galactic field and the long axis of the filament present in the region.
