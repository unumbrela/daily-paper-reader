      "abstract": "Adapting large pretrained models to new tasks efficiently and continually is crucial for real-world deployment but remains challenging due to catastrophic forgetting and the high cost of retraining. While parameter-efficient tuning methods like low rank adaptation (LoRA) reduce computational demands, they lack mechanisms for strict continual learning and knowledge integration, without relying on data replay, or multiple adapters. We propose Share, a novel approach to parameter efficient continual finetuning that learns and dynamically updates a single, shared low-rank subspace, enabling seamless adaptation across multiple tasks and modalities. Share constructs a foundational subspace that extracts core knowledge from past tasks and incrementally integrates new information by identifying essential subspace directions. Knowledge from each new task is incorporated into this evolving subspace, facilitating forward knowledge transfer, while minimizing catastrophic interference. This approach achieves up to 100x parameter reduction and 281x memory savings over traditional LoRA methods, maintaining performance comparable to jointly trained models. A single Share model can replace hundreds of task-specific LoRA adapters, supporting scalable, asynchronous continual learning. Experiments across image classification, natural language understanding, 3D pose estimation, and text-to-image generation validate its effectiveness, making Share a practical and scalable solution for lifelong learning in large-scale AI systems.",

      "abstract": "The Moore-Penrose Pseudo-inverse (PInv) serves as the fundamental solution for linear systems. In this paper, we propose a natural generalization of PInv to the nonlinear regime in general and to neural networks in particular. We introduce Surjective Pseudo-invertible Neural Networks (SPNN), a class of architectures explicitly designed to admit a tractable non-linear PInv. The proposed non-linear PInv and its implementation in SPNN satisfy fundamental geometric properties. One such property is null-space projection or \"Back-Projection\", $x' = x + A^\\dagger(y-Ax)$, which moves a sample $x$ to its closest consistent state $x'$ satisfying $Ax=y$. We formalize Non-Linear Back-Projection (NLBP), a method that guarantees the same consistency constraint for non-linear mappings $f(x)=y$ via our defined PInv. We leverage SPNNs to expand the scope of zero-shot inverse problems. Diffusion-based null-space projection has revolutionized zero-shot solving for linear inverse problems by exploiting closed-form back-projection. We extend this method to non-linear degradations. Here, \"degradation\" is broadly generalized to include any non-linear loss of information, spanning from optical distortions to semantic abstractions like classification. This approach enables zero-shot inversion of complex degradations and allows precise semantic control over generative outputs without retraining the diffusion prior.",

      "abstract": "Multi-image spatial reasoning remains challenging for current multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While single-view perception is inherently 2D, reasoning over multiple views requires building a coherent scene understanding across viewpoints. In particular, we study perspective taking, where a model must build a coherent 3D understanding from multi-view observations and use it to reason from a new, language-specified viewpoint. We introduce CAMCUE, a pose-aware multi-image framework that uses camera pose as an explicit geometric anchor for cross-view fusion and novel-view reasoning. CAMCUE injects per-view pose into visual tokens, grounds natural-language viewpoint descriptions to a target camera pose, and synthesizes a pose-conditioned imagined target view to support answering. To support this setting, we curate CAMCUE-DATA with 27,668 training and 508 test instances pairing multi-view images and poses with diverse target-viewpoint descriptions and perspective-shift questions. We also include human-annotated viewpoint descriptions in the test split to evaluate generalization to human language. CAMCUE improves overall accuracy by 9.06% and predicts target poses from natural-language viewpoint descriptions with over 90% rotation accuracy within 20° and translation accuracy within a 0.5 error threshold. This direct grounding avoids expensive test-time search-and-match, reducing inference time from 256.6s to 1.45s per example and enabling fast, interactive use in real-world scenarios.",

We introduce DyTopo, a manager-guided multi-agent framework that reconstructs a sparse directed communication graph at each round. Conditioned on the manager's round goal, each agent outputs lightweight natural-language query (need) and \\key (offer) descriptors; DyTopo embeds these descriptors and performs semantic matching, routing private messages only along the induced edges. Across code generation and mathematical reasoning benchmarks and four LLM backbones, DyTopo consistently outperforms over the strongest baseline (avg. +6.2). Beyond accuracy, DyTopo yields an interpretable coordination trace via the evolving graphs, enabling qualitative inspection of how communication pathways reconfigure across rounds.",

      "abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made remarkable progress in multimodal perception and reasoning by bridging vision and language. However, most existing MLLMs perform reasoning primarily with textual CoT, which limits their effectiveness on vision-intensive tasks. Recent approaches inject a fixed number of continuous hidden states as \"visual thoughts\" into the reasoning process and improve visual performance, but often at the cost of degraded text-based logical reasoning. We argue that the core limitation lies in a rigid, pre-defined reasoning pattern that cannot adaptively choose the most suitable thinking modality for different user queries. We introduce SwimBird, a reasoning-switchable MLLM that dynamically switches among three reasoning modes conditioned on the input: (1) text-only reasoning, (2) vision-only reasoning (continuous hidden states as visual thoughts), and (3) interleaved vision-text reasoning. To enable this capability, we adopt a hybrid autoregressive formulation that unifies next-token prediction for textual thoughts with next-embedding prediction for visual thoughts, and design a systematic reasoning-mode curation strategy to construct SwimBird-SFT-92K, a diverse supervised fine-tuning dataset covering all three reasoning patterns. By enabling flexible, query-adaptive mode selection, SwimBird preserves strong textual logic while substantially improving performance on vision-dense tasks. Experiments across diverse benchmarks covering textual reasoning and challenging visual understanding demonstrate that SwimBird achieves state-of-the-art results and robust gains over prior fixed-pattern multimodal reasoning methods.",

      "abstract": "To complete assignments provided by humans in natural language, robots must interpret commands, generate and answer relevant questions for scene understanding, and manipulate target objects. Real-world deployments often require multiple heterogeneous robots with different manipulation capabilities to handle different assignments cooperatively. Beyond the need for specialized manipulation skills, effective information gathering is important in completing these assignments. To address this component of the problem, we formalize the information-gathering process in a fully cooperative setting as an underexplored multi-agent multi-task Embodied Question Answering (MM-EQA) problem, which is a novel extension of canonical Embodied Question Answering (EQA), where effective communication is crucial for coordinating efforts without redundancy. To address this problem, we propose CommCP, a novel LLM-based decentralized communication framework designed for MM-EQA. Our framework employs conformal prediction to calibrate the generated messages, thereby minimizing receiver distractions and enhancing communication reliability. To evaluate our framework, we introduce an MM-EQA benchmark featuring diverse, photo-realistic household scenarios with embodied questions. Experimental results demonstrate that CommCP significantly enhances the task success rate and exploration efficiency over baselines.

      "abstract": "Recent progress in spatial reasoning with Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) increasingly leverages geometric priors from 3D encoders. However, most existing integration strategies remain passive: geometry is exposed as a global stream and fused in an indiscriminate manner, which often induces semantic-geometry misalignment and redundant signals. We propose GeoThinker, a framework that shifts the paradigm from passive fusion to active perception. Instead of feature mixing, GeoThinker enables the model to selectively retrieve geometric evidence conditioned on its internal reasoning demands. GeoThinker achieves this through Spatial-Grounded Fusion applied at carefully selected VLM layers, where semantic visual priors selectively query and integrate task-relevant geometry via frame-strict cross-attention, further calibrated by Importance Gating that biases per-frame attention toward task-relevant structures. Comprehensive evaluation results show that GeoThinker sets a new state-of-the-art in spatial intelligence, achieving a peak score of 72.6 on the VSI-Bench. Furthermore, GeoThinker demonstrates robust generalization and significantly improved spatial perception across complex downstream scenarios, including embodied referring and autonomous driving. Our results indicate that the ability to actively integrate spatial structures is essential for next-generation spatial intelligence. Code can be found at https://github.com/Li-Hao-yuan/GeoThinker.",

      "abstract": "Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) deliver strong performance but require inherently sequential decoding, leading to high inference latency and poor GPU utilization. Speculative decoding mitigates this bottleneck by using a fast draft model whose outputs are verified in parallel by the target LLM; however, existing methods still rely on autoregressive drafting, which remains sequential and limits practical speedups. Diffusion LLMs offer a promising alternative by enabling parallel generation, but current diffusion models typically underperform compared with autoregressive models. In this paper, we introduce DFlash, a speculative decoding framework that employs a lightweight block diffusion model for parallel drafting. By generating draft tokens in a single forward pass and conditioning the draft model on context features extracted from the target model, DFlash enables efficient drafting with high-quality outputs and higher acceptance rates. Experiments show that DFlash achieves over 6x lossless acceleration across a range of models and tasks, delivering up to 2.5x higher speedup than the state-of-the-art speculative decoding method EAGLE-3.",

      "abstract": "Humans rarely plan whole-body interactions with objects at the level of explicit whole-body movements. High-level intentions, such as affordance, define the goal, while coordinated balance, contact, and manipulation can emerge naturally from underlying physical and motor priors. Scaling such priors is key to enabling humanoids to compose and generalize loco-manipulation skills across diverse contexts while maintaining physically coherent whole-body coordination. To this end, we introduce InterPrior, a scalable framework that learns a unified generative controller through large-scale imitation pretraining and post-training by reinforcement learning. InterPrior first distills a full-reference imitation expert into a versatile, goal-conditioned variational policy that reconstructs motion from multimodal observations and high-level intent. While the distilled policy reconstructs training behaviors, it does not generalize reliably due to the vast configuration space of large-scale human-object interactions. To address this, we apply data augmentation with physical perturbations, and then perform reinforcement learning finetuning to improve competence on unseen goals and initializations. Together, these steps consolidate the reconstructed latent skills into a valid manifold, yielding a motion prior that generalizes beyond the training data, e.g., it can incorporate new behaviors such as interactions with unseen objects. We further demonstrate its effectiveness for user-interactive control and its potential for real robot deployment.",

We propose V-Retrver, an evidence-driven retrieval framework that reformulates multimodal retrieval as an agentic reasoning process grounded in visual inspection. V-Retrver enables an MLLM to selectively acquire visual evidence during reasoning via external visual tools, performing a multimodal interleaved reasoning process that alternates between hypothesis generation and targeted visual verification.To train such an evidence-gathering retrieval agent, we adopt a curriculum-based learning strategy combining supervised reasoning activation, rejection-based refinement, and reinforcement learning with an evidence-aligned objective.

Recent work has shown that supervised fine-tuning can improve model performance on simple physical tasks. However, fine-tuned models do not appear to learn robust physical rules that can generalize to new contexts. Based on research in cognitive science, we hypothesize that models need to interact with an environment to properly learn its physical dynamics. We train models that learn through interaction with the environment using reinforcement learning. While learning from interaction allows models to improve their within-task performance, it fails to produce models with generalizable physical intuitions. We find that models trained on one task do not reliably generalize to related tasks, even if the tasks share visual statistics and physical principles, and regardless of whether the models are trained through interaction.",

      "abstract": "Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) have achieved remarkable success when applied to various downstream 2D tasks. Despite their effectiveness, they often exhibit a critical lack of 3D awareness. To this end, we introduce Splat and Distill, a framework that instills robust 3D awareness into 2D VFMs by augmenting the teacher model with a fast, feed-forward 3D reconstruction pipeline. Given 2D features produced by a teacher model, our method first lifts these features into an explicit 3D Gaussian representation, in a feedforward manner. These 3D features are then ``splatted\" onto novel viewpoints, producing a set of novel 2D feature maps used to supervise the student model, ``distilling\" geometrically grounded knowledge. By replacing slow per-scene optimization of prior work with our feed-forward lifting approach, our framework avoids feature-averaging artifacts, creating a dynamic learning process where the teacher's consistency improves alongside that of the student. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on a suite of downstream tasks, including monocular depth estimation, surface normal estimation, multi-view correspondence, and semantic segmentation. Our method significantly outperforms prior works, not only achieving substantial gains in 3D awareness but also enhancing the underlying semantic richness of 2D features.

Individual agents then stochastically realize transitions under local constraints, decoupling population inference from entity-level variability.

Experiments across public health, finance, and social sciences show consistent gains in event-time accuracy and calibration over mechanistic, neural, and LLM baselines.

      "abstract": "Active inference (AIF) unifies exploration and exploitation by minimizing the Expected Free Energy (EFE), balancing epistemic value (information gain) and pragmatic value (task performance) through a curiosity coefficient. Yet it has been unclear when this balance yields both coherent learning and efficient decision-making: insufficient curiosity can drive myopic exploitation and prevent uncertainty resolution, while excessive curiosity can induce unnecessary exploration and regret. We establish the first theoretical guarantee for EFE-minimizing agents, showing that a single requirement--sufficient curiosity--simultaneously ensures self-consistent learning (Bayesian posterior consistency) and no-regret optimization (bounded cumulative regret). Our analysis characterizes how this mechanism depends on initial uncertainty, identifiability, and objective alignment, thereby connecting AIF to classical Bayesian experimental design and Bayesian optimization within one theoretical framework. We further translate these theories into practical design guidelines for tuning the epistemic-pragmatic trade-off in hybrid learning-optimization problems, validated through real-world experiments.",

      "abstract": "Recent approaches to real-time long video generation typically employ streaming tuning strategies, attempting to train a long-context student using a short-context (memoryless) teacher. In these frameworks, the student performs long rollouts but receives supervision from a teacher limited to short 5-second windows. This structural discrepancy creates a critical \\textbf{student-teacher mismatch}: the teacher's inability to access long-term history prevents it from guiding the student on global temporal dependencies, effectively capping the student's context length. To resolve this, we propose \\textbf{Context Forcing}, a novel framework that trains a long-context student via a long-context teacher. By ensuring the teacher is aware of the full generation history, we eliminate the supervision mismatch, enabling the robust training of models capable of long-term consistency. To make this computationally feasible for extreme durations (e.g., 2 minutes), we introduce a context management system that transforms the linearly growing context into a \\textbf{Slow-Fast Memory} architecture, significantly reducing visual redundancy. Extensive results demonstrate that our method enables effective context lengths exceeding 20 seconds -- 2 to 10 times longer than state-of-the-art methods like LongLive and Infinite-RoPE. By leveraging this extended context, Context Forcing preserves superior consistency across long durations, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines on various long video evaluation metrics.",

      "abstract": "The impact of the most recent cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) is studied for a model of cosmic inflation which predicts a non-zero vacuum expectation value (VEV) $M$ for a large-field regime. Since lower values of $M$ are compatible with the higher spectral index $n_s$ provided by the ACT+Planck joint analysis, we establish new limits on this parameter while also considering further CMB data from the latest BICEP/Keck Array release for CMB polarization modes. We find $\\log_{10}M/M_{Pl}=-2.5^{+1.1}_{-1.3}$ at 68\\% confidence level, compatible with $M/M_{Pl}\\simeq 0.003$, which is interesting for post-inflationary processes, such as preheating. We conduct a lattice simulation for the inflaton field for the first few e-folds, as the model is compatible with the production of relics such as oscillons, which are possible candidates as sources of gravitational waves and primordial black holes. We find that the model indeed produces localized, quasi-spherical structures compatible with oscillons, which might lead to signatures detectable by future experiments. However, in agreement with recent works, we find that although the abundance of gravitational waves that could be generated in this regime has an amplitude well within the sensitivities of these detectors, the frequency range is on the GHz limit, away from the expected frequencies. Finally, we estimate the impact of a coupling of the type $yφσ^2$ to the inflaton, in the realization of perturbative reheating, directly impacting the predictions of the model, as lower values of $M$ are consistent with both the entire allowed temperature range, and the limits imposed by BICEP/Keck Array+Planck+ACT.",

This limitation is especially problematic for systems that rely on neural network (NN)-based state estimators, which can be highly sensitive to noise and adversarial input perturbations. We address these problems by introducing GUARDIAN: Guaranteed Uncertainty-Aware Reachability Defense against Adversarial INterference, a safety filtering framework that provides formal safety guarantees for systems with NN-based state estimators. At runtime, GUARDIAN uses neural network verification tools to provide guaranteed bounds on the system's state estimate given possible perturbations to its observation. It then uses a modified Hamilton-Jacobi reachability formulation to construct a safety filter that adjusts the nominal control input based on the verified state bounds and safety constraints. The result is an uncertainty-aware filter that ensures safety despite the system's reliance on an NN estimator with noisy, possibly adversarial, input observations. Theoretical analysis and numerical experiments demonstrate that GUARDIAN effectively defends systems against adversarial attacks that would otherwise lead to a violation of safety constraints.",

Although runtime memory utilization is a natural alternative, prior work often incurs substantial overhead and offers limited explicit control over the performance-cost trade-off. In this work, we present \\textbf{BudgetMem}, a runtime agent memory framework for explicit, query-aware performance-cost control. BudgetMem structures memory processing as a set of memory modules, each offered in three budget tiers (i.e., \\textsc{Low}/\\textsc{Mid}/\\textsc{High}). A lightweight router performs budget-tier routing across modules to balance task performance and memory construction cost, which is implemented as a compact neural policy trained with reinforcement learning. Using BudgetMem as a unified testbed, we study three complementary strategies for realizing budget tiers: implementation (method complexity), reasoning (inference behavior), and capacity (module model size). Across LoCoMo, LongMemEval, and HotpotQA, BudgetMem surpasses strong baselines when performance is prioritized (i.e., high-budget setting), and delivers better accuracy-cost frontiers under tighter budgets. Moreover, our analysis disentangles the strengths and weaknesses of different tiering strategies, clarifying when each axis delivers the most favorable trade-offs under varying budget regimes.",

      "abstract": "Little red dots (LRDs) are an abundant population of compact high-redshift sources with red rest-frame optical continua, discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Their red colors and power sources have been attributed either to dust reddening of standard hot accretion disks or to intrinsically cool thermal emission from dense hydrogen envelopes, in both cases surrounding accreting supermassive black holes. These scenarios predict order-of-magnitude differences in emission temperature but have lacked decisive temperature diagnostics. Here we report a prominent absorption feature at rest-frame $\\sim 1.4 \\, μ\\mathrm{m}$ in two out of four LRDs at $z \\sim 2$ with high signal-to-noise JWST spectra, among the coolest from a large LRD sample. The feature matches the shape and wavelength of the water absorption band seen in cool stars. Atmosphere models require $T \\lesssim 3000\\, \\mathrm{K}$ to reproduce it, confirming unambiguously the presence of a cool, dense gas component contributing $20-30\\%$ to the emergent continuum. A composite model reproduces both the absorption and the rest-frame optical-to-infrared continuum shape and suggests a temperature range ($\\sim2000\\, \\mathrm{K} - 4000 \\, \\mathrm{K}$) rather than a single blackbody predicted by some gas envelope models. Molecular absorption demonstrates that the red continua of some LRDs are intrinsic rather than dust-reddened, implying order-of-magnitude lower bolometric luminosities and black-hole masses, and providing a new diagnostic of the emitting gas.",

However, assessing new interventions in VR requires recruiting new participant cohorts for each condition, making large-scale or iterative evaluation difficult. These limitations are especially restrictive when attempting to learn effective intervention strategies, which typically require many training episodes. To address this challenge, we develop a data-driven discrete-event simulator (DES) that models shooter movement and in-region actions as stochastic processes learned from participant behavior in VR studies. We use the simulator to examine the impact of a robot-based shooter intervention strategy. Once shown to reproduce key empirical patterns, the DES enables scalable evaluation and learning of intervention strategies that are infeasible to train directly with human subjects. Overall, this work demonstrates a high-to-mid fidelity simulation workflow that provides a scalable surrogate for developing and evaluating autonomous school-security interventions.",

Modified training objectives can improve calibration, but retraining is expensive. Inference-time steering offers a lightweight alternative, yet most existing methods optimize proxies for correctness rather than correctness itself. We introduce CORAL (Correctness-Optimized Residual Activation Lens), a regularized inference-time steering method that captures distributed correctness signals from model internal activations using weight-decay MLP probes. We evaluate CORAL across three 7B-parameter models and find that it consistently improves accuracy by 10\\% and expected calibration error (ECE) by 50\\% on average. We additionally demonstrate that these gains transfer without retraining to the complete published test sets of four held-out benchmarks (ARC-Challenge, HellaSwag, Math-MC, OpenBookQA), averaging 14\\% accuracy improvements and 49\\% ECE improvements. Our results support the hypothesis that distributed information in model internals can be extracted using regularized probes when individual neurons are insufficient. CORAL thus provides a compute-efficient, transferable, and calibration-aware approach to improve MCQA performance during inference.",

A quantitative understanding of the distribution it generates would be beneficial to, for example, an assessment of the model's performance for downstream applications. We thus explicitly characterize what diffusion model generates, by proposing a log-density ridge manifold and quantifying how the generated data relate to this manifold as inference dynamics progresses. More precisely, inference undergoes a reach-align-slide process centered around the ridge manifold: trajectories first reach a neighborhood of the manifold, then align as being pushed toward or away from the manifold in normal directions, and finally slide along the manifold in tangent directions. Within the scope of this general behavior, different training errors will lead to different normal and tangent motions, which can be quantified, and these detailed motions characterize when inter-mode generations emerge. More detailed understanding of training dynamics will lead to more accurate quantification of the generation inductive bias, and an example of random feature model will be considered, for which we can explicitly illustrate how diffusion model's inductive biases originate as a composition of architectural bias and training accuracy, and how they evolve with the inference dynamics. Experiments on synthetic multimodal distributions and MNIST latent diffusion support the predicted directional effects, in both low- and high-dimensions.",

We consider a conceptualized one-dimensional device, containing a cancer and a population of white blood cells. The interaction between the cancer and the population of cells is modeled by a chemotaxis model inspired by Keller-Segel-type equations, which is solved by a Hybridized Discontinuous Galerkin method. Our goal is using (synthetic) data to tune the parameters of the governing equations and to assess the uncertainty on the predictions of the dynamics due to the residual uncertainty on the parameters remaining after the tuning procedure. To this end, we apply techniques from uncertainty quantification for parametric differential models. We first perform a global sensitivity analysis using both Sobol and Morris indices to assess how parameter uncertainty impacts model predictions, and fix the value of parameters with negligible impact. Subsequently, we conduct an inverse uncertainty quantification analysis by Bayesian techniques to compute a data-informed probability distribution of the remaining model parameters. Finally, we carry out a forward uncertainty quantification analysis to compute the impact of the updated (residual) parametric uncertainties on the quantities of interest of the model. The whole procedure is sped up by using surrogate models, based on sparse-grids, to approximate the mapping of the uncertain parameters to the quantities of interest.",

However, existing video fusion methods heavily rely on optical flow estimation and feature warping, resulting in severe computational overhead and limited scalability. This paper presents MambaVF, an efficient video fusion framework based on state space models (SSMs) that performs temporal modeling without explicit motion estimation. First, by reformulating video fusion as a sequential state update process, MambaVF captures long-range temporal dependencies with linear complexity while significantly reducing computation and memory costs. Second, MambaVF proposes a lightweight SSM-based fusion module that replaces conventional flow-guided alignment via a spatio-temporal bidirectional scanning mechanism. This module enables efficient information aggregation across frames. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our MambaVF achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-exposure, multi-focus, infrared-visible, and medical video fusion tasks. We highlight that MambaVF enjoys high efficiency, reducing up to 92.25% of parameters and 88.79% of computational FLOPs and a 2.1x speedup compared to existing methods.

      "title": "Convex unions and completions from simplicial pseudomanifolds",
      "abstract": "While intersections of convex sets are convex, their unions have rather complicated behavior. Some natural contexts where they appear include duality arguments involving boundaries of convex sets and valuations, which have an Euler characteristic-like structure. However, there are certain settings where the convexity property itself is important to consider. For example, this includes (preservation of) positivity properties of divisors on toric varieties under blowdowns. In the case of (restrictions of) conormal bundles, this can be interpreted in terms of interactions between local convexity data stored in rational equivalence relations. We consider generalizations to realizations of simplicial pseudomanifolds and replace rational equivalence with effects of PL homeomorphisms.   Decomposing the PL homeomorphisms into edge subdivisions and contractions, we characterize the space of suitable contraction points compatible with local convexity properties in terms of convex unions and completions. This gives rise to certain external edge subdivisions that make this ``contraction space'' of the starting edge empty, which is unexpected given the expected ``increased convexity'' from edge subdivisions. We also obtain strong affine/linear restrictions on realizations of facets containing nearby edges preserving local convexity. This implies that contracting certain nearby edges results in a very large or very small contraction space of the starting edge. As for boundary behavior, there are parallels between effects of PL homeomorphisms on induced 4-cycles in the 1-skeleton. Finally, we find effects of PL homeomorphisms and suspensions on analogues of local convexity properties stored by linear systems of parameters. This indicates that simplicial spheres PL homeomorphic to the boundary of a cross polytope store record local convexity changes in the most natural way.",

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used in a zero-shot fashion to assess mental health conditions, yet we have limited knowledge on what factors affect their accuracy. In this study, we utilize a clinical dataset of natural language narratives and self-reported PTSD severity scores from 1,437 individuals to comprehensively evaluate the performance of 11 state-of-the-art LLMs. To understand the factors affecting accuracy, we systematically varied (i) contextual knowledge like subscale definitions, distribution summary, and interview questions, and (ii) modeling strategies including zero-shot vs few shot, amount of reasoning effort, model sizes, structured subscales vs direct scalar prediction, output rescaling and nine ensemble methods. Our findings indicate that (a) LLMs are most accurate when provided with detailed construct definitions and context of the narrative; (b) increased reasoning effort leads to better estimation accuracy; (c) performance of open-weight models (Llama, Deepseek), plateau beyond 70B parameters while closed-weight (o3-mini, gpt-5) models improve with newer generations; and (d) best performance is achieved when ensembling a supervised model with the zero-shot LLMs. Taken together, the results suggest choice of contextual knowledge and modeling strategies is important for deploying LLMs to accurately assess mental health.",

Classical asymptotic theory for sample means can fail because arm-specific sample sizes are random and coupled with the rewards through the action-selection rule. We study this phenomenon in the $K$-armed Gaussian bandit and identify \\emph{optimism} as a key mechanism for restoring \\emph{stability}, a sufficient condition for valid asymptotic inference requiring each arm's pull count to concentrate around a deterministic scale. First, we prove that variance-inflated TS \\citep{halder2025stable} is stable for any $K \\ge 2$, including the challenging regime where multiple arms are optimal. This resolves the open question raised by \\citet{halder2025stable} through extending their results from the two-armed setting to the general $K$-armed setting. Second, we analyze an alternative optimistic modification that keeps the posterior variance unchanged but adds an explicit mean bonus to posterior mean, and establish the same stability conclusion. In summary, suitably implemented optimism stabilizes Thompson sampling and enables asymptotically valid inference in multi-armed bandits, while incurring only a mild additional regret cost.",

To resolve these limitations, we introduce GenArena, a unified evaluation framework that leverages a pairwise comparison paradigm to ensure stable and human-aligned evaluation. Crucially, our experiments uncover a transformative finding that simply adopting this pairwise protocol enables off-the-shelf open-source models to outperform top-tier proprietary models. Notably, our method boosts evaluation accuracy by over 20% and achieves a Spearman correlation of 0.86 with the authoritative LMArena leaderboard, drastically surpassing the 0.36 correlation of pointwise methods. Based on GenArena, we benchmark state-of-the-art visual generation models across diverse tasks, providing the community with a rigorous and automated evaluation standard for visual generation.",

We simulate the slow formation of an MHD pedestal in a heated and sheared Z-pinch, which collapses on reaching a critical height, expelling an order-unity fraction of the confined thermal energy. The MHD pedestal then rebuilds and the process repeats, in a manner analogous to the ELM cycle seen in fusion experiments. We show that the available energy of the metastable equilibrium, and the most energetically favorable amount of ejected plasma, can be calculated from first principles via combinatorial optimization of flux-tube interchanges.",

This construction relies on the identification of the XOR-Ising field with the cosine or sine of a Gaussian free field (GFF) $φ$ multiplied by $α= 1/\\sqrt{2}$, and is obtained by an appropriate exploration of two-valued level sets of the GFF. More generally, the same construction applies to the fields $:\\! \\cos(αφ) \\!:$ and $:\\! \\sin(αφ) \\!:$ for any $α\\in (0,1)$.   In the second part, we show that the continuum excursion decomposition arises as the scaling limit of the double random current decomposition of the critical XOR-Ising model on the square lattice. To this end, we exploit the rich Markovian structure of the discrete decomposition and strengthen the convergence of the double random current height function to the continuum GFF by establishing joint convergence with its cosine and sine. We conjecture that for $α\\in [1/2,\\sqrt{3}/2)$ the continuum excursion decompositions arise as the scaling limit of those of the Ashkin-Teller polarisation field along its critical line.",

We characterize which advisories are more likely to be reviewed, quantify review delays, and identify two distinct review-latency regimes: a fast path dominated by GitHub Repository Advisories (GRAs) and a slow path dominated by NVD-first advisories.

AgenticPay models markets in which buyers and sellers possess private constraints and product-dependent valuations, and must reach agreements through multi-round linguistic negotiation rather than numeric bidding alone.

Benchmarking state-of-the-art proprietary and open-weight LLMs reveals substantial gaps in negotiation performance and highlights challenges in long-horizon strategic reasoning, establishing AgenticPay as a foundation for studying agentic commerce and language-based market interaction.

Using a Bayesian forward model, we jointly fit the X-ray luminosity--temperature (LT) and thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich--temperature (YT) relations, marginalising over the latent cluster distances and modelling selection effects as well as peculiar velocities. The latter are modelled using reconstructions of the local peculiar velocity field where we self-consistently account for possible anisotropic redshift--distance relations via an approximate scheme. This treatment proves crucial to the inferred anisotropy and breaks the degeneracy between anisotropy in scaling relation normalisations and underlying cosmological anisotropy. We apply our method to 312 clusters at $z \\lesssim 0.2$, testing dipolar, quadrupolar and general (pixelised) anisotropy models. Bayesian model selection finds no more than weak evidence for any anisotropic model. For dipole models, we obtain upper limits of $δH_0 / H_0 < 3.2\\%$ and bulk flow magnitude $< 1300\\,\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}}$. Our results contrast with previous claims of statistically significant anisotropy from the same data, which we attribute to our principled forward modelling of both redshifts and scaling relation observables through latent distances and our treatment of the impact of anisotropic redshift--distance relations when modelling the local peculiar velocity field. Our work highlights the importance of accurately modelling peculiar velocities when testing isotropy with distance indicators, and motivates the further development of reconstructions that self-consistently treat large-scale deviations from the Hubble flow.",

Prior research has largely examined these forces in isolation, yet it remains unclear to what extent supply meets demand. We address this gap with an empirical analysis of a unique dataset of 1.1 million fact-checks and fact-checking requests from X's Community Notes platform between June 2024 and May 2025. We find that requests disproportionately target highly visible posts - those with more views and engagement and authored by influential accounts - whereas fact-checks are distributed more broadly across languages, sentiments, and topics. Using a quasi-experimental survival analysis, we further estimate the effect of displaying requests on subsequent note creation. Results show that requests significantly accelerate contributions from Top Writers. Altogether, our findings highlight a gap between the content that attracts requests for fact-checking and the content that ultimately receives fact-checks, while showing that user requests can steer contributors toward greater alignment.

Recent proposals using qubits encoded in frequency modes promise a large reduction in hardware footprint, and have garnered much attention. In this encoding, linear optics, i.e., beam splitters and phase shifters, is necessarily not energy-conserving, and is costly to implement. In this work, we present designs of frequency-mode beam splitters based on modulated arrays of coupled resonators. We develop a methodology to construct their effective transfer matrices based on the SLH formalism for quantum input-output networks. Our methodology is flexible and highly composable, allowing us to define $N$-mode beam splitters either natively based on arrays of $N$-resonators of arbitrary connectivity or as networks of interconnected $l$-mode beam splitters, with $l<N$. We apply our methodology to analyze a two-resonator device, a frequency-domain phase shifter and a Mach-Zehnder interferometer obtained from composing these devices, a four-resonator device, and present a formal no-go theorem on the possibility of natively generating certain $N$-mode frequency-domain beam splitters with arrays of $N$-resonators.",

Calibration along a set of discrete directions in the sky is the default technique to estimate and correct these systematic errors. However, additional processing such as smoothing and mosaicing are required to reconcile the step wise variation of the estimated systematic errors at the edges of the discrete directions (facets). We overcome the discrete nature of direction-dependent calibration by using image-domain gridding as the model for the calibration. Instead of discrete directions in the sky, calibration is performed using a basis that represents a set of sub-grids in the Fourier space. This automatically removes the need for extra operations to recover the wide-field systematics error model without any discontinuity. We provide results based on LOFAR data where we compare the traditional facet-based (discrete directional gains) calibration with the proposed approach. The comparison shows improved image quality, mainly because of the physical plausibility of the proposed approach as opposed to using a piecewise constant model for direction-dependent systematic errors.",

      "abstract": "We introduce multi-task Visuo-Tactile World Models (VT-WM), which capture the physics of contact through touch reasoning. By complementing vision with tactile sensing, VT-WM better understands robot-object interactions in contact-rich tasks, avoiding common failure modes of vision-only models under occlusion or ambiguous contact states, such as objects disappearing, teleporting, or moving in ways that violate basic physics. Trained across a set of contact-rich manipulation tasks, VT-WM improves physical fidelity in imagination, achieving 33% better performance at maintaining object permanence and 29% better compliance with the laws of motion in autoregressive rollouts. Moreover, experiments show that grounding in contact dynamics also translates to planning. In zero-shot real-robot experiments, VT-WM achieves up to 35% higher success rates, with the largest gains in multi-step, contact-rich tasks. Finally, VT-WM demonstrates significant downstream versatility, effectively adapting its learned contact dynamics to a novel task and achieving reliable planning success with only a limited set of demonstrations.",

Recent studies have leveraged pre-trained models to extract features for downstream tasks such as SER. This work explores the capabilities of Whisper, a pre-trained ASR system, in speech emotion recognition by proposing two attention-based pooling methods, Multi-head Attentive Average Pooling and QKV Pooling, designed to efficiently reduce the dimensionality of Whisper representations while preserving emotional features. We experiment on English and Persian, using the IEMOCAP and ShEMO datasets respectively, with Whisper Tiny and Small. Our multi-head QKV architecture achieves state-of-the-art results on the ShEMO dataset, with a 2.47% improvement in unweighted accuracy. We further compare the performance of different Whisper encoder layers and find that intermediate layers often perform better for SER on the Persian dataset, providing a lightweight and efficient alternative to much larger models such as HuBERT X-Large. Our findings highlight the potential of Whisper as a representation extractor for SER and demonstrate the effectiveness of attention-based pooling for dimension reduction.",

      "abstract": "How does the amount of compute available to a reinforcement learning (RL) policy affect its learning? Can policies using a fixed amount of parameters, still benefit from additional compute? The standard RL framework does not provide a language to answer these questions formally. Empirically, deep RL policies are often parameterized as neural networks with static architectures, conflating the amount of compute and the number of parameters. In this paper, we formalize compute bounded policies and prove that policies which use more compute can solve problems and generalize to longer-horizon tasks that are outside the scope of policies with less compute. Building on prior work in algorithmic learning and model-free planning, we propose a minimal architecture that can use a variable amount of compute. Our experiments complement our theory. On a set 31 different tasks spanning online and offline RL, we show that $(1)$ this architecture achieves stronger performance simply by using more compute, and $(2)$ stronger generalization on longer-horizon test tasks compared to standard feedforward networks or deep residual network using up to 5 times more parameters.",

Existing multimodal large language models perform this mapping directly from screenshots but are trained without observing the visual outcomes of their generated code. In contrast, human developers iteratively render their implementation, compare it with the design, and learn how visual differences relate to code changes. Inspired by this process, we propose VisRefiner, a training framework that enables models to learn from visual differences between rendered predictions and reference designs. We construct difference-aligned supervision that associates visual discrepancies with corresponding code edits, allowing the model to understand how appearance variations arise from implementation changes. Building on this, we introduce a reinforcement learning stage for self-refinement, where the model improves its generated code by observing both the rendered output and the target design, identifying their visual differences, and updating the code accordingly. Experiments show that VisRefiner substantially improves single-step generation quality and layout fidelity, while also endowing models with strong self-refinement ability. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of learning from visual differences for advancing screenshot-to-code generation.",

Each treatment corresponds to a parameter value of the advertising mechanism (e.g., auction reserve-price), and we want to estimate through experiments the corresponding long-term treatment effect (e.g., annual advertising revenue). In our setting, the treatment affects not only the instantaneous revenue from showing an ad, but also changes each user's interaction-trajectory, and each advertiser's bidding policy -- as the latter is constrained by a finite budget. In particular, each a treatment may even affect the size of the population, since users interact longer with a tolerable advertising mechanism. We drop the classical i.i.d. assumption and model the experiment measurements (e.g., advertising revenue) as a stopped random walk, and use a budget-splitting experimental design, the Anscombe Theorem, a Wald-like equation, and a Central Limit Theorem to construct confidence intervals for the long-term treatment effect.",

However, when utilised within skipless architectures, which aim to improve representation learning, recent work has highlighted the inherent instability of SSA due to inducing rank collapse and poorly-conditioned Jacobians. In this work, we design a novel attention mechanism: Orthogonal Self-Attention (OSA), which aims to bypass these issues with SSA, in order to allow for (non-causal) Transformers without skip connections and normalisation layers to be more easily trained. In particular, OSA parametrises the attention matrix to be orthogonal via mapping a skew-symmetric matrix, formed from query-key values, through the matrix exponential. We show that this can be practically implemented, by exploiting the low-rank structure of our query-key values, resulting in the computational complexity and memory cost of OSA scaling linearly with sequence length. Furthermore, we derive an initialisation scheme for which we prove ensures that the Jacobian of OSA is well-conditioned.",

This non-$1/v$ behavior arises from the presence of neutron resonances in the neutron-capture cross sections that overlap with the source neutron spectrum at low ($<5$~eV) energies. Historically, Westcott $g$ factors that have been cataloged for NAA and PGAA applications are the result of calculations that assume a Maxwellian neutron velocity distribution with a given average temperature. In this study, we use this approach with updated neutron-capture cross sections from the Evaluated Nuclear Data File, version VIII.1 (ENDF/B-VIII.1) to tabulate Westcott $g$ factor values for a broad range of Maxwellian distribution temperatures, comparing the results against currently-available $g$ factors from International Atomic Energy Agency tables and other sources. It was discovered during this analysis that the use of guided thermal and cold-neutron beams at certain facilities necessitates an approach for evaluating Westcott $g$ factors based on arbitrary non-Maxwellian spectra. In this paper, we present an approach for calculating $g$ factors with user-specified neutron spectra, and we apply these methods to obtain Westcott $g$-factors for guided- and cold-neutron beams at the Budapest Research Reactor and the Forschungsreaktor M{ü}nchen II reactor.

Remarkably, we demonstrate that this behavior persists even in the deep quantum regime with only two qubits. We systematically study the dependence of the TQC lifetime, $τ^{\\ast}$, on the number of qubits and demonstrate that $τ^{\\ast}$ increases monotonically with the system size.

We argue that efficient reward alignment should be a property of the generative model itself, not an afterthought, and redesign the model for adaptability. We propose \"Diamond Maps\", stochastic flow map models that enable efficient and accurate alignment to arbitrary rewards at inference time. Diamond Maps amortize many simulation steps into a single-step sampler, like flow maps, while preserving the stochasticity required for optimal reward alignment. This design makes search, sequential Monte Carlo, and guidance scalable by enabling efficient and consistent estimation of the value function. Our experiments show that Diamond Maps can be learned efficiently via distillation from GLASS Flows, achieve stronger reward alignment performance, and scale better than existing methods. Our results point toward a practical route to generative models that can be rapidly adapted to arbitrary preferences and constraints at inference time.",

      "abstract": "Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative for text generation, distinguished by their native support for parallel decoding. In practice, block inference is crucial for avoiding order misalignment in global bidirectional decoding and improving output quality. However, the widely-used fixed, predefined block (naive) schedule is agnostic to semantic difficulty, making it a suboptimal strategy for both quality and efficiency: it can force premature commitments to uncertain positions while delaying easy positions near block boundaries. In this work, we analyze the limitations of naive block scheduling and disclose the importance of dynamically adapting the schedule to semantic difficulty for reliable and efficient inference. Motivated by this, we propose Dynamic Sliding Block (DSB), a training-free block scheduling method that uses a sliding block with a dynamic size to overcome the rigidity of the naive block. To further improve efficiency, we introduce DSB Cache, a training-free KV-cache mechanism tailored to DSB. Extensive experiments across multiple models and benchmarks demonstrate that DSB, together with DSB Cache, consistently improves both generation quality and inference efficiency for dLLMs. Code is released at https://github.com/lizhuo-luo/DSB.",

We noted that asymmetric CCFs with lags of a few hundred secondsbetween soft and hard band LCs in the horizontal branch, whereas CCFs remained symmetric in normal and flaring branches. We also performed a CCF study during the flux transition duration and observed lags of the order of a few tens to hundreds of seconds. Monte Carlo simulations were performed to assess the robustness of these CCFs, confirming their significance at a 95% confidence level. Spectral analysis during the flux transitions further suggests that the inner accretion disk extends close to the last stable orbit. We propose that the observed hard lags arise from the readjustment of the boundary layer/coronal region located near the inner edge of the accretion disk. From the measured lags, we estimate the characteristic size of the boundary layer. We show that the observed lags could also be associated with the depletion timescale of the boundary layer with low viscosity.",

      "abstract": "Pre-training Large Language Models (LLMs) on web-scale datasets becomes fundamental for advancing general-purpose AI. In contrast, enhancing their predictive performance on downstream tasks typically involves adapting their knowledge through fine-tuning. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), aim to reduce the computational cost of this process by freezing the pre-trained model and updating a smaller number of parameters. In comparison to full fine-tuning, these methods achieve over 99\\% reduction in trainable parameter count, depending on the configuration. Unfortunately, such a reduction may prove insufficient as LLMs continue to grow in scale. In this work, we address the previous problem by systematically selecting only a few layers to fine-tune using LoRA or its variants. We argue that not all layers contribute equally to the model adaptation. Leveraging this, we identify the most relevant layers to fine-tune by measuring their contribution to changes in internal representations. Our method is orthogonal to and readily compatible with existing low-rank adaptation techniques. We reduce the trainable parameters in LoRA-based techniques by up to 50\\%, while maintaining the predictive performance across different models and tasks. Specifically, on encoder-only architectures, this reduction in trainable parameters leads to a negligible predictive performance drop on the GLUE benchmark. On decoder-only architectures, we achieve a small drop or even improvements in the predictive performance on mathematical problem-solving capabilities and coding tasks. Finally, this effectiveness extends to multimodal models, for which we also observe competitive results relative to fine-tuning with LoRA modules in all layers.

      "abstract": "The emergence of Large Language Model (LLM) agents enables us to build agent-based intelligent systems that move beyond the role of a \"tool\" to become genuine collaborators with humans, thereby realizing a novel human-agent collaboration paradigm. Our vision is that LLM agents should resemble remote human collaborators, which allows HCI researchers to ground the future exploration in decades of research on trust, awareness, and common ground in remote human collaboration, while also revealing the unique opportunities and challenges that emerge when one or more partners are AI agents. This workshop establishes a foundational research agenda for the new era by posing the question: How can the rich understanding of remote human collaboration inspire and inform the design and study of human-agent collaboration? We will bring together an interdisciplinary group from HCI, CSCW, and AI to explore this critical transition. The 180-minute workshop will be highly interactive, featuring a keynote speaker, a series of invited lightning talks, and an exploratory group design session where participants will storyboard novel paradigms of human-agent partnership. Our goal is to enlighten the research community by cultivating a shared vocabulary and producing a research agenda that charts the future of collaborative agents.",

      "abstract": "While generative video models have achieved remarkable visual fidelity, their capacity to internalize and reason over implicit world rules remains a critical yet under-explored frontier. To bridge this gap, we present RISE-Video, a pioneering reasoning-oriented benchmark for Text-Image-to-Video (TI2V) synthesis that shifts the evaluative focus from surface-level aesthetics to deep cognitive reasoning. RISE-Video comprises 467 meticulously human-annotated samples spanning eight rigorous categories, providing a structured testbed for probing model intelligence across diverse dimensions, ranging from commonsense and spatial dynamics to specialized subject domains. Our framework introduces a multi-dimensional evaluation protocol consisting of four metrics: \\textit{Reasoning Alignment}, \\textit{Temporal Consistency}, \\textit{Physical Rationality}, and \\textit{Visual Quality}. To further support scalable evaluation, we propose an automated pipeline leveraging Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to emulate human-centric assessment. Extensive experiments on 11 state-of-the-art TI2V models reveal pervasive deficiencies in simulating complex scenarios under implicit constraints, offering critical insights for the advancement of future world-simulating generative models.",

We derive a black brane solution for this model, accurate to the first order in the coupling parameter. Using gauge/gravity duality techniques, we then compute two key holographic transport coefficients: the color non-abelian direct current (DC) conductivity and the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy density. Our analysis reveals that both transport coefficients are modified by the non-minimal coupling, with the conductivity bound violated for positive $q_2$ and the Kovtun-Son-Starinets (KSS) bound for shear viscosity violated for negative $q_2$. In the limit where the non-minimal coupling vanishes, our results consistently reduce to those of the standard Yang-Mills Schwarzschild Anti-de Sitter (AdS) black brane.",

      "abstract": "The temperature range of the blue phases (BPs) formed in highly chiral mixtures based on cholesteryl oleyl carbonate (COC) and the nematic liquid crystal E7 was studied in the presence of various chemical structures. The $azo$ compounds used were of both chiral and achiral nature, and their molecular geometry was modified by substitution of modular \"LEGO\" molecular units of varying alkyl chain lengths and types of bridging groups, which could substantially affect the mesomorphic properties of the matrix mixture. It was shown that in many cases these dopants effectively broadened the BP temperature range. This effect depends on both the variation in the molecular geometry of the $azo$ compounds and the increase in the $cis$-isomer concentration under UV irradiation. The presence of the $cis$-isomers formed have a stronger impact on broadening the BP temperature range than the initial $trans$-isomers. These results demonstrate that the temperature range of BPs can be precisely controlled via a combination of molecular engineering and $trans$-$cis$ photo-isomerization.",

      "abstract": "The operational effectiveness of digital-twin technology in motorway traffic management depends on the availability of a continuous flow of high-resolution real-time traffic data. To function as a proactive decision-making support layer within traffic management, a digital twin must also incorporate predicted traffic conditions in addition to real-time observations. Due to the spatio-temporal complexity and the time-variant, non-linear nature of traffic dynamics, predicting motorway traffic remains a difficult problem. Sequence-based deep-learning models offer clear advantages over classical machine learning and statistical models in capturing long-range, temporal dependencies in time-series traffic data, yet limitations in forecasting accuracy and model complexity point to the need for further improvements. To improve motorway traffic forecasting, this paper introduces a Geographically-aware Transformer-based Traffic Forecasting GATTF model, which exploits the geographical relationships between distributed sensors using their mutual information (MI). The model has been evaluated using real-time data from the Geneva motorway network in Switzerland and results confirm that incorporating geographical awareness through MI enhances the accuracy of GATTF forecasting compared to a standard Transformer, without increasing model complexity.",

      "abstract": "Optical parametric amplifiers (OPAs) are promising to overcome the wavelength coverage and noise limitations in conventional optical amplifiers based on rare-earth doping and semiconductor gain. However, the high power requirement remains a major obstacle to the widespread use of OPAs. Integrated OPAs can in principle improve the pump efficiency with tight mode confinement; however, challenges associated with propagation loss, limited nonlinearity, and susceptibility to nanoscale fabrication imperfections prevent them from competing with conventional bulk and fiber-based OPAs. Here, we demonstrate a highly efficient integrated OPAs with continuous-wave net gain. The pump efficiency is improved by over one order of magnitude. Phase-sensitive gain of 23.5 dB is demonstrated, significantly exceeding previous integrated OPAs, using only 110 mW pump power and no cavity enhancement. This is achieved with parametric down-conversion in thin-film lithium niobate waveguides using the adapted poling technique to maintain the coherence of nonlinear interactions. Moreover, the high parametric gain exceeds fibre-chip-fibre losses, leading to appreciable net gain up to 10 dB. The 3 dB bandwidth is approximately 120 nm, covering telecommunication S-, C-, and Lbands. Quantum-limited noise performance is confirmed through the measurement of output field fluctuation below the classical limit. We further demonstrate that signalto-noise ratio in noisy optical communications can be increased by leveraging this efficient integrated OPA. Our work marks a significant step towards ideal optical amplifiers with strong amplification, high efficiency, quantum-limited noise, large bandwidth, and continuous-wave operation, unlocking new possibilities for next-generation photonic information processing systems.",

In self-similar variables, the solution becomes asymptotically hydrodynamic - the distribution function converges to a local Maxwellian, while the hydrodynamic fields develop an asymptotically self-similar implosion whose profile coincides with a smooth imploding profile of the compressible Euler equations. To our knowledge, this provides the first example of a collisional kinetic model which is globally well-posed in the homogeneous setting, but admits finite time singularities for inhomogeneous data.",

While these problems are typically studied with positive weight coefficients associated to each distance term, more general signed Wasserstein barycenter problems have recently drawn a great deal of interest. These mixed sign problems have appeared in statistical inference setting as a way to generalize least squares regression to measure valued outputs and have appeared in numerical methods to improve the accuracy of Wasserstein gradient flow solvers. Unfortunately, the presence of negatively weighted distance terms destroys the Euclidean convexity of the unsigned problem, resulting in a much more challenging optimization task. The main focus of this work is to study properties of the signed barycenter problem for a general transport cost with a focus on establishing uniqueness of solutions. In particular, when there is only one positive weight, we extend the uniqueness result of Tornabene et al. (2025) to any cost satisfying a certain convexity property. In the case of arbitrary weights, we introduce the dual problem in terms of Kantorovich potentials and provide a sufficient condition for a stationary solution of the dual problem to induce an optimal signed barycenter.",

To investigate this, we introduce SAGE, a benchmark for scientific literature retrieval comprising 1,200 queries across four scientific domains, with a 200,000 paper retrieval corpus.We evaluate six deep research agents and find that all systems struggle with reasoning-intensive retrieval. Using DR Tulu as backbone, we further compare BM25 and LLM-based retrievers (i.e., ReasonIR and gte-Qwen2-7B-instruct) as alternative search tools. Surprisingly, BM25 significantly outperforms LLM-based retrievers by approximately 30%, as existing agents generate keyword-oriented sub-queries. To improve performance, we propose a corpus-level test-time scaling framework that uses LLMs to augment documents with metadata and keywords, making retrieval easier for off-the-shelf retrievers.

While this dual reformulation guarantees convergence with mixed-integer state variables, it admits multiple optimal solutions that can yield weak cuts. To address this issue, we propose normalizing the dual in the extended space to identify solutions that yield stronger cuts. We prove that the resulting normalized cuts are tight and Pareto-optimal in the original state space. We further compare normalization with existing regularization-based approaches for handling dual degeneracy and explain why normalization offers key advantages. In particular, we show that normalization can recover any cut obtained via regularization, whereas the converse does not hold. Computational experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods by consistently yielding stronger cuts and reducing solution times on harder instances.",

Confronting this framework with inflationary observables, growth of structure and the observed near flatness of the universe, we derive strong infrared constraints that suppress non Hermiticity across cosmic history. We demonstrate that these bounds are mutually consistent between early and late-time probes and can be partially relaxed in theories beyond General Relativity. Our results establish cosmology as a novel arena for testing foundational aspects of quantum mechanics and suggest that Hermiticity may emerge dynamically along the semiclassical branch describing our universe.",

      "abstract": "Semantic representations can be framed as a structured, dynamic knowledge space through which humans navigate to retrieve and manipulate meaning. To investigate how humans traverse this geometry, we introduce a framework that represents concept production as navigation through embedding space. Using different transformer text embedding models, we construct participant-specific semantic trajectories based on cumulative embeddings and extract geometric and dynamical metrics, including distance to next, distance to centroid, entropy, velocity, and acceleration. These measures capture both scalar and directional aspects of semantic navigation, providing a computationally grounded view of semantic representation search as movement in a geometric space. We evaluate the framework on four datasets across different languages, spanning different property generation tasks: Neurodegenerative, Swear verbal fluency, Property listing task in Italian, and in German. Across these contexts, our approach distinguishes between clinical groups and concept types, offering a mathematical framework that requires minimal human intervention compared to typical labor-intensive linguistic pre-processing methods. Comparison with a non-cumulative approach reveals that cumulative embeddings work best for longer trajectories, whereas shorter ones may provide too little context, favoring the non-cumulative alternative. Critically, different embedding models yielded similar results, highlighting similarities between different learned representations despite different training pipelines. By framing semantic navigation as a structured trajectory through embedding space, bridging cognitive modeling with learned representation, thereby establishing a pipeline for quantifying semantic representation dynamics with applications in clinical research, cross-linguistic analysis, and the assessment of artificial cognition.",

We find loss scales inversely proportional to depth in LLMs, probably due to functionally similar layers reducing error through ensemble averaging rather than compositional learning or discretizing smooth dynamics. This regime is inefficient yet robust and may arise from the architectural bias of residual networks and target functions incompatible with smooth dynamics. The findings suggest that improving LLM efficiency may require architectural innovations to encourage compositional use of depth.",

      "abstract": "We evaluate the capability of current and next-generation gravitational wave detectors, such as Advanced LIGO, Einstein Telescope and DECIGO, to constrain cosmographic parameters using electromagnetically bright standard sirens. By adopting a third-order Taylor expansion, we analyze how signal-to-noise ratios and the number of events impact the estimates of the Hubble constant ($H_0$), the deceleration ($q_0$) and jerk ($j_0$) parameters. Our results show that while Advanced LIGO provides a calibration-free measurement of $H_0$ at the few-percent level, it remains insensitive to higher-order parameters. In contrast, the Einstein Telescope and DECIGO reach sub-percent accuracy for $H_0$. Notably, DECIGO achieves a precision better than 10\\% for the deceleration parameter $q_0$ and a few tens of percent for the jerk parameter $j_0$.",

      "abstract": "Hydraulic systems are widely utilized in industrial applications due to their high force generation, precise control, and ability to function in harsh environments. Hydraulic cylinders, as actuators in these systems, apply force and position through the displacement of hydraulic fluid, but their operation is significantly influenced by friction force. Achieving precision in hydraulic cylinders requires an accurate friction model under various operating conditions. Existing analytical models, often derived from experimental tests, necessitate the identification or estimation of influencing factors but are limited in adaptability and computational efficiency. This research introduces a data-driven, hybrid algorithm based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Random Forests for nonlinear friction force estimation. The algorithm effectively combines feature detection and estimation processes using training data acquired from an experimental hydraulic test setup. It achieves a consistent and stable model error of less than 10% across diverse operating conditions and external load variations, ensuring robust performance in complex situations. The computational cost of the algorithm is 1.51 milliseconds per estimation, making it suitable for real-time applications. The proposed method addresses the limitations of analytical models by delivering high precision and computational efficiency. The algorithm's performance is validated through detailed analysis and experimental results, including direct comparisons with the LuGre model. The comparison highlights that while the LuGre model offers a theoretical foundation for friction modeling, its performance is limited by its inability to dynamically adjust to varying operational conditions of the hydraulic cylinder, further emphasizing the advantages of the proposed hybrid approach in real-time applications.",

      "abstract": "Controllable video generation has emerged as a versatile tool for autonomous driving, enabling realistic synthesis of traffic scenarios. However, existing methods depend on control signals at inference time to guide the generative model towards temporally consistent generation of dynamic objects, limiting their utility as scalable and generalizable data engines. In this work, we propose Localized Semantic Alignment (LSA), a simple yet effective framework for fine-tuning pre-trained video generation models. LSA enhances temporal consistency by aligning semantic features between ground-truth and generated video clips. Specifically, we compare the output of an off-the-shelf feature extraction model between the ground-truth and generated video clips localized around dynamic objects inducing a semantic feature consistency loss. We fine-tune the base model by combining this loss with the standard diffusion loss. The model fine-tuned for a single epoch with our novel loss outperforms the baselines in common video generation evaluation metrics. To further test the temporal consistency in generated videos we adapt two additional metrics from object detection task, namely mAP and mIoU. Extensive experiments on nuScenes and KITTI datasets show the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing temporal consistency in video generation without the need for external control signals during inference and any computational overheads.",

      "abstract": "Agentic systems solve complex tasks by coordinating multiple agents that iteratively reason, invoke tools, and exchange intermediate results. To improve robustness and solution quality, recent approaches deploy multiple agent teams running in parallel to explore diverse reasoning trajectories. However, parallel execution comes at a significant computational cost: when different teams independently reason about similar sub-problems or execute analogous steps, they repeatedly perform substantial overlapping computation. To address these limitations, in this paper, we propose Learning to Share (LTS), a learned shared-memory mechanism for parallel agentic frameworks that enables selective cross-team information reuse while controlling context growth. LTS introduces a global memory bank accessible to all teams and a lightweight controller that decides whether intermediate agent steps should be added to memory or not. The controller is trained using stepwise reinforcement learning with usage-aware credit assignment, allowing it to identify information that is globally useful across parallel executions. Experiments on the AssistantBench and GAIA benchmarks show that LTS significantly reduces overall runtime while matching or improving task performance compared to memory-free parallel baselines, demonstrating that learned memory admission is an effective strategy for improving the efficiency of parallel agentic systems.

The present manuscript addresses this in the context of an initial value problem in smoothly bounded $n$-dimensional domains with $n\\ge 2$, posed under homogeneous boundary conditions of Dirichlet type for the displacement variable $u$, and of Neumann type for the temperature $Θ$. Within suitably generalized concepts of solvability, global existence of solutions is shown without any size restrictions on the data, and for a system actually more general than ($\\star$) by, inter alia, allowing the heat capacity $κ$ to depend on $Θ$. Apart from that, results on large time behavior are derived which particularly assert stabilization of $Θ$ toward a spatially homogeneous limit.   Besides on standard features related to energy conservation and entropy production, in its core parts the analysis relies on an evolution property of certain logarithmic refinements of classical entropy functionals, to the best of our knowledge undiscovered in precedent literature and possibly of independent interest.",

      "abstract": "Sampling from a distribution $p(x) \\propto e^{-\\mathcal{E}(x)}$ known up to a normalising constant is an important and challenging problem in statistics. Recent years have seen the rise of a new family of amortised sampling algorithms, commonly referred to as diffusion samplers, that enable fast and efficient sampling from an unnormalised density. Such algorithms have been widely studied for continuous-space sampling tasks; however, their application to problems in discrete space remains largely unexplored. Although some progress has been made in this area, discrete diffusion samplers do not take full advantage of ideas commonly used for continuous-space sampling. In this paper, we propose to bridge this gap by introducing off-policy training techniques for discrete diffusion samplers. We show that these techniques improve the performance of discrete samplers on both established and new synthetic benchmarks. Next, we generalise discrete diffusion samplers to the task of bridging between two arbitrary distributions, introducing data-to-energy Schrödinger bridge training for the discrete domain for the first time. Lastly, we showcase the application of the proposed diffusion samplers to data-free posterior sampling in the discrete latent spaces of image generative models.",

These breakdowns coincide with transient boundary reorganization while bulk area growth remains sustained. Our results demonstrate that visually distinct morphologies can arise within the same geometric growth regime, and that departures from single-scale behavior reflect intrinsic dynamical restructuring rather than growth arrest.

While computing nonnegative integer rank is generally very hard, we focus on a fundamental special case: determining when a rank 2 nonnegative integer matrix has nonnegative integer rank equal to 2 (the \"rank2 problem\"). Although this problem is trivial in the continuous case, in this context it is surprisingly rich.   We provide a geometric reformulation in terms of affine semigroups and rational cones in the plane, which yields new structural insights. We show that any rank 2 integer matrix can be reduced to a $3\\times 3$ matrix which has nonnegative integer rank $2$ if and only if the original one also has nonnegative integer rank $2$, with the reduction computable in polynomial time. This reduction reveals that the difficulty of the rank2 problem is already captured by small matrices. Building on this geometric framework, we also develop an algorithm that solves the rank2 problem by strategically searching for integer generators within bounded regions of the associated cone. Although the theoretical worst-case complexity remains high, numerical experiments demonstrate that the algorithm performs efficiently in practice.",

Selected for their high ratio of dark matter to baryonic matter, dSphs are useful for this type of search owing to the low background emission. In comparison to previous HAWC studies, we significantly improve our sensitivity to DM from dSphs due to improvements to our event reconstruction and reduced hadronic contamination. We expanded the number of dSphs studied, DM annihilation channels into the Standard Model (SM), and the amount of data collected on each previously studied dSph. We searched for DM signals in each dSph using the latest version of the algorithms used to reconstruct data from the primary detector of the HAWC instrument.

      "abstract": "Winds launched at the scale of the accretion disc or dusty torus in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are thought to drive energy-conserving outflows that shape galaxy evolution. The key signature of such outflows, the presence of a hot ($T \\gtrsim 10^9 \\, \\rm K$), shocked wind component, is hard to detect directly. Observations of AGN outflows typically probe a separate outflow phase: cool/warm gas with $T \\lesssim 10^5 \\, \\rm K$. Here, we show that the density of cool outflowing gas scales with AGN luminosity, serving as an indirect diagnostic of the elusive hot, shocked wind. We use hydrodynamic simulations with the moving-mesh code AREPO to target the interaction between a small-scale AGN wind of speed $\\approx 10^4 \\, \\rm km \\, s^{-1}$ and galactic discs containing an idealised, clumpy interstellar medium (ISM). Through a new refinement scheme targeting rapidly-cooling, fast-moving gas, our simulations reach a resolution of $\\lesssim 0.1 \\, \\rm pc$ in the cool, outflowing phase. We extract an ensemble of cool clouds from the AGN-driven outflows produced in our simulations, finding that their densities increase systematically with AGN wind power and AGN luminosity. Moreover, the mass distribution and internal properties of these cloudlets appear to be insensitive to the initial properties of the ISM, and shaped mainly by the dynamics of radiative, turbulent mixing layers. The increase in cool outflow density with kinetic wind power and AGN luminosity has profound implications for observational estimates of outflow rates and their scaling with AGN luminosity. Depending on the available outflow and density tracers, observationally-derived outflow rates may be overestimated by orders of magnitude.",

      "abstract": "We study the \\emph{Online Facility Assignment} (OFA) problem on a discrete $r\\times c$ grid graph under the standard model of Ahmed, Rahman, and Kobourov: a fixed set of facilities is given, each with limited capacity, and an online sequence of unit-demand requests must be irrevocably assigned upon arrival to an available facility, incurring Manhattan ($L_1$) distance cost. We investigate how the discrete geometry of grids interacts with capacity depletion by analyzing two natural baselines and one capacity-aware heuristic. First, we give explicit adversarial sequences on grid instances showing that purely local rules can be forced into large competitive ratios: (i) a capacity-sensitive weighted-Voronoi heuristic (\\textsc{CS-Voronoi}) can suffer cascading \\emph{region-collapse} effects when nearby capacity is exhausted; and (ii) nearest-available \\textsc{Greedy} (with randomized tie-breaking) can be driven into repeated long reassignments via an \\emph{oscillation} construction. These results formalize geometric failure modes that are specific to discrete $L_1$ metrics with hard capacities. Motivated by these lower bounds, we then discuss a semi-online extension in which the algorithm may delay assignment for up to $τ$ time steps and solve each batch optimally via a min-cost flow computation. We present this batching framework as a remediation strategy and delineate the parameters that govern its performance, while leaving sharp competitive guarantees for this semi-online variant as an open direction.",

      "abstract": "Flow matching has recently emerged as a promising alternative to diffusion-based generative models, particularly for text-to-image generation. Despite its flexibility in allowing arbitrary source distributions, most existing approaches rely on a standard Gaussian distribution, a choice inherited from diffusion models, and rarely consider the source distribution itself as an optimization target in such settings. In this work, we show that principled design of the source distribution is not only feasible but also beneficial at the scale of modern text-to-image systems. Specifically, we propose learning a condition-dependent source distribution under flow matching objective that better exploit rich conditioning signals. We identify key failure modes that arise when directly incorporating conditioning into the source, including distributional collapse and instability, and show that appropriate variance regularization and directional alignment between source and target are critical for stable and effective learning. We further analyze how the choice of target representation space impacts flow matching with structured sources, revealing regimes in which such designs are most effective. Extensive experiments across multiple text-to-image benchmarks demonstrate consistent and robust improvements, including up to a 3x faster convergence in FID, highlighting the practical benefits of a principled source distribution design for conditional flow matching.",

      "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely used for learning on structured data, yet their ability to distinguish non-isomorphic graphs is fundamentally limited. These limitations are usually attributed to message passing; in this work we show that an independent bottleneck arises at the readout stage. Using finite-dimensional representation theory, we prove that all linear permutation-invariant readouts, including sum and mean pooling, factor through the Reynolds (group-averaging) operator and therefore project node embeddings onto the fixed subspace of the permutation action, erasing all non-trivial symmetry-aware components regardless of encoder expressivity. This yields both a new expressivity barrier and an interpretable characterization of what global pooling preserves or destroys. To overcome this collapse, we introduce projector-based invariant readouts that decompose node representations into symmetry-aware channels and summarize them with nonlinear invariant statistics, preserving permutation invariance while retaining information provably invisible to averaging. Empirically, swapping only the readout enables fixed encoders to separate WL-hard graph pairs and improves performance across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating that readout design is a decisive and under-appreciated factor in GNN expressivity.",

      "abstract": "The well-studied DISPERSION problem is a fundamental coordination problem in distributed robotics, where a set of mobile robots must relocate so that each occupies a distinct node of a network. DISPERSION assumes that a robot can settle at any node as long as no other robot settles on that node. In this work, we introduce LOCATION-AWARE DISPERSION, a novel generalization of DISPERSION that incorporates location awareness: Let $G = (V, E)$ be an anonymous, connected, undirected graph with $n = |V|$ nodes, each labeled with a color $\\sf{col}(v) \\in C = \\{c_1, \\dots, c_t\\}, t\\leq n$. A set $R = \\{r_1, \\dots, r_k\\}$ of $k \\leq n$ mobile robots is given, where each robot $r_i$ has an associated color $\\mathsf{col}(r_i) \\in C$. Initially placed arbitrarily on the graph, the goal is to relocate the robots so that each occupies a distinct node of the same color. When $|C|=1$, LOCATION-AWARE DISPERSION reduces to DISPERSION. There is a solution to DISPERSION in graphs with any $k\\leq n$ without knowing $k,n$.   Like DISPERSION, the goal is to solve LOCATION-AWARE DISPERSION minimizing both time and memory requirement at each agent. We develop several deterministic algorithms with guaranteed bounds on both time and memory requirement. We also give an impossibility and a lower bound for any deterministic algorithm for LOCATION-AWARE DISPERSION. To the best of our knowledge, the presented results collectively establish the algorithmic feasibility of LOCATION-AWARE DISPERSION in anonymous networks and also highlight the challenges on getting an efficient solution compared to the solutions for DISPERSION.",

This pulsar is known to orbit a compact high-mass companion with a period of 3.98\\,hrs in a mildly eccentric orbit ($e = 0.085$). By combining all data and maintaining a coherent timing solution over the full span, we obtained a more precise measurement of the advance of periastron, $\\dotω = 7.5841(2)$\\,$°$\\,yr$^{-1}$, the Einstein delay, $γ= 4.59(2) \\times 10^{-4}$\\,s, and the secular change in orbital period, $\\dot{P}_{\\rm b} = -5.65(2) \\times 10^{-13}$\\,s\\,s$^{-1}$.

The $\\dot{x}$ has a similar magnitude to that observed in PSR~J1141$-$6545, which is due to spin-orbit coupling; if confirmed, it would indicate that, as in the latter system, the companion of the PSR~J1906+0746 system is a massive fast-rotating white dwarf formed before the pulsar.

      "abstract": "High-quality representations are a core requirement for effective recommendation. In this work, we study the problem of LLM-based descriptor generation, i.e., keyphrase-like natural language item representation generation frameworks with minimal constraints on downstream applications. We propose AgenticTagger, a framework that queries LLMs for representing items with sequences of text descriptors. However, open-ended generation provides little control over the generation space, leading to high cardinality, low-performance descriptors that renders downstream modeling challenging. To this end, AgenticTagger features two core stages: (1) a vocabulary building stage where a set of hierarchical, low-cardinality, and high-quality descriptors is identified, and (2) a vocabulary assignment stage where LLMs assign in-vocabulary descriptors to items. To effectively and efficiently ground vocabulary in the item corpus of interest, we design a multi-agent reflection mechanism where an architect LLM iteratively refines the vocabulary guided by parallelized feedback from annotator LLMs that validates the vocabulary against item data. Experiments on public and private data show AgenticTagger brings consistent improvements across diverse recommendation scenarios, including generative and term-based retrieval, ranking, and controllability-oriented, critique-based recommendation.",

      "abstract": "Ensuring data quality in machine learning (ML) systems has become increasingly complex as regulatory requirements expand. In the European Union (EU), frameworks such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Artificial Intelligence Act (AI Act) articulate data quality requirements that closely parallel technical concerns in ML practice, while also extending to legal obligations related to accountability, risk management, and human rights protection. This paper presents a qualitative interview study with EU-based data practitioners working on ML systems in regulated contexts. Through semi-structured interviews, we investigate how practitioners interpret regulatory-aligned data quality, the challenges they encounter, and the supports they identify as necessary. Our findings reveal persistent gaps between legal principles and engineering workflows, fragmentation across data pipelines, limitations of existing tools, unclear responsibility boundaries between technical and legal teams, and a tendency toward reactive, audit-driven quality practices. We also identify practitioners' needs for compliance-aware tooling, clearer governance structures, and cultural shifts toward proactive data governance.",

      "abstract": "Merging finetuned Large Language Models (LLMs) has become increasingly important for integrating diverse capabilities into a single unified model. However, prevailing model merging methods rely on linear arithmetic in Euclidean space, which often destroys the intrinsic geometric properties of pretrained weights, such as hyperspherical energy. To address this, we propose Orthogonal Model Merging (OrthoMerge), a method that performs merging operations on the Riemannian manifold formed by the orthogonal group to preserve the geometric structure of the model's weights. By mapping task-specific orthogonal matrices learned by Orthogonal Finetuning (OFT) to the Lie algebra, OrthoMerge enables a principled yet efficient integration that takes into account both the direction and intensity of adaptations. In addition to directly leveraging orthogonal matrices obtained by OFT, we further extend this approach to general models finetuned with non-OFT methods (i.e., low-rank finetuning, full finetuning) via an Orthogonal-Residual Decoupling strategy. This technique extracts the orthogonal components of expert models by solving the orthogonal Procrustes problem, which are then merged on the manifold of the orthogonal group, while the remaining linear residuals are processed through standard additive merging. Extensive empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of OrthoMerge in mitigating catastrophic forgetting and maintaining model performance across diverse tasks.",

The struggle is caused by the limited abilities for both multilingual question understanding and multilingual reasoning. To address both problems, we propose TRIT (Translation-Reasoning Integrated Training), a self-improving framework that integrates the training of translation into multilingual reasoning. Without external feedback or additional multilingual data, our method jointly enhances multilingual question understanding and response generation. On MMATH, our method outperforms multiple baselines by an average of 7 percentage points, improving both answer correctness and language consistency. Further analysis reveals that integrating translation training improves cross-lingual question alignment by over 10 percentage points and enhances translation quality for both mathematical questions and general-domain text, with gains up to 8.4 COMET points on FLORES-200.",

      "abstract": "Distribution shift is a common challenge in medical images obtained from different clinical centers, significantly hindering the deployment of pre-trained semantic segmentation models in real-world applications across multiple domains. Continual Test-Time Adaptation(CTTA) has emerged as a promising approach to address cross-domain shifts during continually evolving target domains. Most existing CTTA methods rely on incrementally updating model parameters, which inevitably suffer from error accumulation and catastrophic forgetting, especially in long-term adaptation. Recent prompt-tuning-based works have shown potential to mitigate the two issues above by updating only visual prompts. While these approaches have demonstrated promising performance, several limitations remain:1)lacking multi-scale prompt diversity, 2)inadequate incorporation of instance-specific knowledge, and 3)risk of privacy leakage. To overcome these limitations, we propose Multi-scale Global-Instance Prompt Tuning(MGIPT), to enhance scale diversity of prompts and capture both global- and instance-level knowledge for robust CTTA. Specifically, MGIPT consists of an Adaptive-scale Instance Prompt(AIP) and a Multi-scale Global-level Prompt(MGP). AIP dynamically learns lightweight and instance-specific prompts to mitigate error accumulation with adaptive optimal-scale selection mechanism. MGP captures domain-level knowledge across different scales to ensure robust adaptation with anti-forgetting capabilities. These complementary components are combined through a weighted ensemble approach, enabling effective dual-level adaptation that integrates both global and local information. Extensive experiments on medical image segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our MGIPT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving robust adaptation across continually changing target domains.",

We perform a complete re-reduction of these data, including a custom optimal-extraction approach to combat the spectral \"wiggles\" that result from undersampling of the NIRSpec spatial PSF. We constrain the star-formation histories and stellar metallicities of these objects via full-spectral fitting, finding a clear stellar age vs stellar mass correlation, in which more massive galaxies assembled their stellar mass at earlier times. This confirms spectroscopically that the archaeological \"downsizing\" trend was already in place by $z\\simeq4$. The slope of our measured relation ($\\simeq1.5$ Gyr per dex in stellar mass) is consistent with literature results at $0 < z < 3$. We do not observe objects with $\\log_{10}(M_*/\\mathrm{M_\\odot})\\lesssim10.5$ and ages of more than a few hundred Myr at this epoch, suggesting that recently reported examples of higher-redshift quiescent galaxies at these masses are likely to soon rejuvenate. We measure relatively high stellar metallicities for the majority of our sample, consistent with similar objects at $0 < z < 3$. Finally, we explore evidence for $α$-enhancement in six older and more luminous galaxies within our sample, finding considerable disagreements in the chemical abundances measured using different stellar population models, different fitted rest-frame wavelength ranges, star-formation history models and fitting codes. We therefore conclude that inferring detailed stellar chemical abundances for the earliest quiescent galaxies remains challenging, and higher signal-to-noise spectra are required (SNR per resolution element $>100$ for $R\\simeq1000$).",

      "abstract": "Policy mirror descent (PMD) provides a principled framework for reinforcement learning (RL) by iteratively solving KL-regularized policy improvement subproblems. While this approach has been adopted in training advanced LLMs such as Kimi K1.5/K2, the ideal closed-form PMD updates require reliable partition function estimation, a significant challenge when working with limited rollouts in the vast action spaces of LLMs. We investigate a practical algorithm, termed PMD-mean, that approximates the log-partition term with the mean reward under the sampling policy and performs regression in log-policy space. Specifically, we characterize the population solution of PMD-mean and demonstrate that it implicitly optimizes mirror descent subproblems with an adaptive mixed KL--$χ^2$ regularizer. This additional $χ^2$ regularization constrains large probability changes, producing more conservative updates when expected rewards are low and enhancing robustness against finite-sample estimation errors. Experiments on math reasoning tasks show that PMD-mean achieves superior performance with improved stability and time efficiency. These findings deepen our understanding of PMD-mean and illuminate pathways toward principled improvements in RL algorithms for LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/horizon-rl/OpenKimi.",

      "abstract": "Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs) are often used to assess knowledge, reasoning abilities, and even values encoded in large language models (LLMs). While the effect of multilingualism has been studied on LLM factual recall, this paper seeks to investigate the less explored question of language-induced variation in value-laden MCQ responses. Are multilingual LLMs consistent in their responses across languages, i.e. behave like theoretical polyglots, or do they answer value-laden MCQs depending on the language of the question, like a multitude of monolingual models expressing different values through a single model? We release a new corpus, the Multilingual European Value Survey (MEVS), which, unlike prior work relying on machine translation or ad hoc prompts, solely comprises human-translated survey questions aligned in 8 European languages. We administer a subset of those questions to over thirty multilingual LLMs of various sizes, manufacturers and alignment-fine-tuning status under comprehensive, controlled prompt variations including answer order, symbol type, and tail character. Our results show that while larger, instruction-tuned models display higher overall consistency, the robustness of their responses varies greatly across questions, with certain MCQs eliciting total agreement within and across models while others leave LLM answers split. Language-specific behavior seems to arise in all consistent, instruction-fine-tuned models, but only on certain questions, warranting a further study of the selective effect of preference fine-tuning.",

In this work, we demonstrate in silico that a canonical Molecular Communication (MC) channel can function as a highly versatile and task-adaptive PRC whose computational properties are reconfigurable. Using a dual-simulation approach -- a computationally efficient deterministic mean-field model and a high-fidelity particle-based stochastic model (Smoldyn) -- we show that tuning the channel's underlying biophysical parameters, such as ligand-receptor kinetics and diffusion dynamics, allows the reservoir to be optimized for distinct classes of computation. We employ Bayesian optimization to efficiently navigate this high-dimensional parameter space, identifying discrete operational regimes. Our results reveal a clear trade-off: parameter sets rich in channel memory excel at chaotic time-series forecasting tasks (e.g., Mackey Glass), while regimes that promote strong receptor nonlinearity are superior for nonlinear data transformation. We further demonstrate that post-processing methods improve the performance of the stochastic reservoir by mitigating intrinsic molecular noise. These findings establish the MC channel not merely as a computational substrate, but as a design blueprint for tunable, bioinspired computing systems, providing a clear optimization framework for future wetware AI implementations.",

The state-of-the-art 3DReach method answers such queries by encoding graph reachability through interval labelling and indexing spatial vertices in a 3D R-tree. We present 2DReach, a simpler approach that avoids interval labelling entirely. Like 3DReach, 2DReach collapses strongly connected components (SCCs) into a DAG, but instead of computing interval labels, it directly stores a 2D R-tree per component over all reachable spatial vertices. A query then reduces to a single 2D R-tree lookup. We further propose compressed variants that reduce storage by excluding spatial sinks and sharing R-trees between components with identical reachable sets. Experiments on four real-world datasets show that 2DReach achieves faster index construction than 3DReach, with the compressed variant yielding the smallest index size among all methods. 2DReach delivers competitive or superior query performance with more stable response times across varying query parameters.",

Traditional parametric approaches can be trained to generate integer-count predictions but may struggle with capturing complex, non-linear dependencies often observed in the data. Gaussian process (GP) regression provides a robust non-parametric alternative to modeling continuous data; however, it cannot generate integer outputs. We propose the Poisson Log-Normal (PoLoN) process, a framework that employs GP to model Poisson log-rates. As in GP regression, our approach relies on the correlations between data points captured via GP kernel structure rather than explicit functional parameterizations. We demonstrate that the PoLoN predictive distribution is Poisson-LogNormal and provide an algorithm for optimizing kernel hyperparameters. Furthermore, we adapt the PoLoN approach to the problem of detecting weak localized signals superimposed on a smoothly varying background - a task of considerable interest in many areas of science and engineering. Our framework allows us to predict the strength, location and width of the detected signals. We evaluate PoLoN's performance using both synthetic and real-world datasets, including the open dataset from CERN which was used to detect the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider. Our results indicate that the PoLoN process can be used as a non-parametric alternative for analyzing, predicting, and extracting signals from integer-valued data.",

      "abstract": "Recent results from combined cosmological probes indicate that the Dark Energy component of the Universe could be dynamical. The simplest explanation envisages the presence of a quintessence field rolling into a potential, where the Dark Energy energy density parameter $Ω_{DE}=Ω_Λ+Ω_{x}$ results from the contribution of the ground state energy $Ω_Λ$ and the scalar field energy $Ω_{x}$. Provided that $Ω_{DE}\\approx 0.7$, negative values of $Ω_Λ$ can be consistent with current measurements from cosmological probes, and could help in explaining the large abundance of bright galaxies observed by JWST at $z> 10$, largely exceeding the pre-JWST expectations in a $ΛCDM$ Universe. Here we explore to what extent such a scenario can account also for the early presence of massive Black Holes (BHs) with masses $M_{BH}\\gtrsim 10^7\\,M_{\\odot}$ observed at $z\\gtrsim 8$, and for the large over-abundance of AGN with respect to pre-JWST expectations. Our aim is not to provide a detailed description of BH growth, but rather to compute the maximal BH growth that can occur in cosmological models with negative $Ω_Λ$ under the simple assumption of Eddington-limited accretion onto initial light Black Hole seeds with mass $M_{seed}\\sim 10^2\\,M_{\\odot}$ originated from PopIII stars. To this aim we develop a simple analytic framework to connect the growth of dark matter halos to the maximal growth of BHs within the above assumptions. We show such models can account for present observations assuming values of $Ω_Λ\\approx -1$, simultaneously boosting both galaxy and AGN number counts without invoking any additional physics. This would allow us to trace the observed excess of bright and massive galaxies and the early formation of massive Black Holes and the abundance of AGN to the same cosmological origin.",

      "abstract": "This paper addresses the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) by comparing classical and quantum Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches. An Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) agent is implemented in classical, full quantum, and hybrid variants, integrating transformer architectures to capture the relationships between vehicles, clients, and the depot through self- and cross-attention mechanisms. The experiments focus on multi-vehicle scenarios with capacity constraints, considering 20 clients and 4 vehicles, and are conducted over ten independent runs. Performance is assessed using routing distance, route compactness, and route overlap. The results show that all three approaches are capable of learning effective routing policies. However, quantum-enhanced models outperform the classical baseline and produce more robust route organization, with the hybrid architecture achieving the best overall performance across distance, compactness, and route overlap. In addition to quantitative improvements, qualitative visualizations reveal that quantum-based models generate more structured and coherent routing solutions. These findings highlight the potential of hybrid quantum-classical reinforcement learning models for addressing complex combinatorial optimization problems such as the CVRP.",

      "abstract": "This is the first article in a series of three dealing with the exploitation of speckle for imaging purposes. Speckle is the complex interference wave-field produced by a random distribution of un-resolved scatterers. In this paper, we show how these scatterers can be used as virtual microphones to monitor the spatio-temporal propagation of a wave-packet inside the medium. To do so, the concept of matrix imaging is particularly useful. It consists in decoupling the location of the transmitted and received focal spots in a standard beamforming process. By scanning the wave-field with the output focal spot that then acts as a virtual transducer, one can image the spatio-temporal evolution of the wave-packet inside the medium. This unique observable will allow us to highlight the imperfections of the focusing process, in particular the defocus and reverberations induced by a strong aberrating layer. As a proof-of-concept, we will consider ultrasound experiments on tissue-mimicking phantoms. In the next two papers, we will show how this observable can be leveraged to compensate for these phenomena that hamper wave focusing and imaging in all fields of wave physics. Our method is indeed broadly applicable to different types of waves beyond ultrasound for which multi-element technology allows a reflection matrix to be measured.",

The model is considered on a bounded interval with non-homogeneous Dirichlet boundary data and a prescribed history function. To accommodate the loss of global smoothness in time caused by delay terms, solutions are understood in a \\textit{stepwise classical sense}, allowing jump discontinuities in the second time derivative at multiples of the delay while maintaining continuity of the solution and its first time derivative.   By combining separation of variables with Sturm-Liouville expansions, the delayed PDE is reduced to a family of scalar second-order delay differential equations. Using delay-dependent fundamental solutions, we derive closed-form representation formulas for the modal dynamics and reconstruct the PDE solution as a Fourier series. Convergence conditions guaranteeing uniform convergence and admissibility of termwise differentiation in space are established. A numerical example demonstrates the practical computation of truncated series solutions and their visualization.",

However, they are prone to faithfulness hallucinations, especially in intermediate reasoning steps. Existing mitigation methods based on online reinforcement learning rely on outcome-based rewards or coarse-grained CoT evaluation, which can inadvertently reinforce unfaithful reasoning when the final answer is correct. To address these limitations, we propose Faithfulness-Aware Step-Level Reinforcement Learning (FaithRL), introducing step-level supervision via explicit faithfulness rewards from a process reward model, together with an implicit truncated resampling strategy that generates contrastive signals from faithful prefixes. Experiments across multiple SRMs and Open-Book QA benchmarks demonstrate that FaithRL consistently reduces hallucinations in both the CoT and final answers, leading to more faithful and reliable reasoning.

All experiments are conducted in simulation, where the task is characterized by tight geometric tolerances between the discharge-unit hooks and the container rings relative to the overall crane scale, making precise trajectory tracking and swing suppression essential. The nominal controller uses admittance control for trajectory tracking and pendulum-aware swing damping, followed by damped least-squares inverse kinematics with a nullspace posture term to generate joint velocity commands. A PPO-trained residual policy in Isaac Lab compensates for unmodeled dynamics and parameter variations, improving precision and robustness without requiring end-to-end learning from scratch. We further employ randomized episode initialization and domain randomization over payload properties, actuator gains, and passive joint parameters to enhance generalization. Simulation results demonstrate improved tracking accuracy, reduced oscillations, and higher lifting success rates compared to the nominal controller alone.",

We introduce ContextBench, a process-oriented evaluation of context retrieval in coding agents. ContextBench consists of 1,136 issue-resolution tasks from 66 repositories across eight programming languages, each augmented with human-annotated gold contexts. We further implement an automated evaluation framework that tracks agent trajectories and measures context recall, precision, and efficiency throughout issue resolution. Using ContextBench, we evaluate four frontier LLMs and five coding agents. Our results show that sophisticated agent scaffolding yields only marginal gains in context retrieval (\"The Bitter Lesson\" of coding agents), LLMs consistently favor recall over precision, and substantial gaps exist between explored and utilized context. ContextBench augments existing end-to-end benchmarks with intermediate gold-context metrics that unbox the issue-resolution process. These contexts offer valuable intermediate signals for guiding LLM reasoning in software tasks. Data and code are available at: https://cioutn.github.io/context-bench/.",

      "abstract": "As Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve breakthroughs in complex reasoning, Codeforces-based Elo ratings have emerged as a prominent metric for evaluating competitive programming capabilities. However, these ratings are often reported without critical experimental details, leading to significant discrepancies illustrated by recent reports where the score of the same model version fluctuated by nearly 500 points. This paper presents a systematic empirical study on the hidden factors biasing Elo evaluations: (1) the temporal ordering of submissions, (2) contest difficulty selection, and (3) run to run stochastic variability of LLMs. Utilizing a controlled benchmark of 37 recent Codeforces contests and 13,691 generated test cases, we demonstrate that Elo scores are highly sensitive to these parameters. Our findings reveal that varying submission orders can shift scores by 394 points, while contest selection can cause differences of up to 1,122 points for the same model. Run to run performance exhibits substantial instability, with a maximum difference of 349 points in mean scores observed when evaluating identical contests. We conclude that direct Elo comparisons are unreliable and potentially misleading without strict standardization and transparent reporting of experimental settings.",

      "abstract": "Training reinforcement learning (RL) systems in real-world environments remains challenging due to noisy supervision and poor out-of-domain (OOD) generalization, especially in LLM post-training. Recent distributional RL methods improve robustness by modeling values with multiple quantile points, but they still learn each quantile independently as a scalar. This results in rough-grained value representations that lack fine-grained conditioning on state information, struggling under complex and OOD conditions. We propose DFPO (Distributional Value Flow Policy Optimization with Conditional Risk and Consistency Control), a robust distributional RL framework that models values as continuous flows across time steps. By scaling value modeling through learning of a value flow field instead of isolated quantile predictions, DFPO captures richer state information for more accurate advantage estimation. To stabilize training under noisy feedback, DFPO further integrates conditional risk control and consistency constraints along value flow trajectories. Experiments on dialogue, math reasoning, and scientific tasks show that DFPO outperforms PPO, FlowRL, and other robust baselines under noisy supervision, achieving improved training stability and generalization.",

      "abstract": "High-quality kernel is critical for scalable AI systems, and enabling LLMs to generate such code would advance AI development. However, training LLMs for this task requires sufficient data, a robust environment, and the process is often vulnerable to reward hacking and lazy optimization. In these cases, models may hack training rewards and prioritize trivial correctness over meaningful speedup. In this paper, we systematically study reinforcement learning (RL) for kernel generation. We first design KernelGYM, a robust distributed GPU environment that supports reward hacking check, data collection from multi-turn interactions and long-term RL training. Building on KernelGYM, we investigate effective multi-turn RL methods and identify a biased policy gradient issue caused by self-inclusion in GRPO. To solve this, we propose Turn-level Reinforce-Leave-One-Out (TRLOO) to provide unbiased advantage estimation for multi-turn RL. To alleviate lazy optimization, we incorporate mismatch correction for training stability and introduce Profiling-based Rewards (PR) and Profiling-based Rejection Sampling (PRS) to overcome the issue. The trained model, Dr.Kernel-14B, reaches performance competitive with Claude-4.5-Sonnet in Kernelbench. Finally, we study sequential test-time scaling for Dr.Kernel-14B. On the KernelBench Level-2 subset, 31.6% of the generated kernels achieve at least a 1.2x speedup over the Torch reference, surpassing Claude-4.5-Sonnet (26.7%) and GPT-5 (28.6%). When selecting the best candidate across all turns, this 1.2x speedup rate further increases to 47.8%.

      "abstract": "Understanding how galaxies trace the underlying matter density field is essential for characterizing the influence of the large-scale structure on galaxy formation, being therefore a key ingredient in observational cosmology. This connection, commonly described through the galaxy bias, $b$, can be studied effectively using machine learning (ML) techniques, which offer strong predictive capabilities and can capture non-linear relationships. We aim to incorporate the linear bias parameter assigned to individual galaxies into a ML framework, quantify its dependence on various halo and environmental properties, and evaluate whether different algorithms can accurately predict this parameter and reproduce the scatter in several bias relations. We use data from the IllustrisTNG300 simulation, including the distance to different cosmic-web structures computed with DisPerSE. These data are complemented with an object-by-object estimator of the large-scale linear bias ($b_i$), providing the individual contribution of each galaxy to the bias of the entire population. Our ML framework uses three models to predict $b_i$: a Random Forest Regressor, a Neural Network and a probabilistic method (Normalizing Flows). We recover the full hierarchy of galaxy bias dependencies, showing that the most informative features are the overdensities, particularly $δ_8$, followed by the distances to cosmic-web structures and selected internal halo properties, most notably $z_{1/2}$. We also demonstrate that Normalizing Flows clearly outperform deterministic methods in predicting galaxy bias, including its joint distributions with galaxy properties, owing to their ability to capture the intrinsic variance associated with the stochastic nature of the matter-halo-galaxy connection. Our ML framework provides a foundation for future efforts to measure individual bias with upcoming spectroscopic surveys.",

As these intelligent assistants coordinate with external services via protocols such as Google's Agent-to-Agent (A2A), they establish attack surfaces where manipulations can propagate through natural language payloads, potentially causing severe consequences ranging from driver distraction to unauthorized vehicle control. Existing AI security frameworks, while foundational, lack the rigorous \"separation of concerns\" standard in safety-critical systems engineering by co-mingling the concepts of what is being protected (assets) with how it is attacked (attack paths). This paper addresses this methodological gap by proposing a threat modeling framework called AgentHeLLM (Agent Hazard Exploration for LLM Assistants) that formally separates asset identification from attack path analysis. We introduce a human-centric asset taxonomy derived from harm-oriented \"victim modeling\" and inspired by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and a formal graph-based model that distinguishes poison paths (malicious data propagation) from trigger paths (activation actions). We demonstrate the framework's practical applicability through an open-source attack path suggestion tool AgentHeLLM Attack Path Generator that automates multi-stage threat discovery using a bi-level search strategy.",

The variational inference (VI) is one of the most widely adopted approximate inference methods. Whereas the ELBO-based variational free energy method is a dominant choice in the literature, in this paper we introduce a score-based alternative for BNN variational inference. Although there have been quite a few score-based variational inference methods proposed in the community, most are not adequate for large-scale BNNs for various computational and technical reasons. We propose a novel scalable VI method where the learning objective combines the score matching loss and the proximal penalty term in iterations, which helps our method avoid the reparametrized sampling, and allows for noisy unbiased mini-batch scores through stochastic gradients. This in turn makes our method scalable to large-scale neural networks including Vision Transformers, and allows for richer variational density families.

In this paper, we developed an automated pipeline and examine the proceedings of four major high-performance computing conferences, comparing the accuracy of citations between the 2021 and 2025 proceedings. While none of the 2021 papers contained mysterious citations, every 2025 proceeding did, impacting 2-6\\% of published papers. In addition, we observe a sharp rise in paper title and authorship errors, motivating the need for stronger citation-verification practice. No author within our dataset acknowledged using AI to generate citations even though all four conference policies required it, indicating current policies are insufficient.",

To address this gap, we introduce BABE(Biology Arena BEnchmark), a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the experimental reasoning capabilities of biological AI systems. BABE is uniquely constructed from peer-reviewed research papers and real-world biological studies, ensuring that tasks reflect the complexity and interdisciplinary nature of actual scientific inquiry. BABE challenges models to perform causal reasoning and cross-scale inference.

While traditional systems often rely on manually engineered, single-sensor pipelines, this paper presents a learning-based framework that uses an intermediate, robot-centric heightmap representation.

The architecture integrates multimodal data from an Intel RealSense depth camera, a LIVOX MID-360 LiDAR processed via efficient spherical projection, and an onboard IMU. Quantitative results demonstrate that multimodal fusion improves reconstruction accuracy by 7.2% over depth-only and 9.9% over LiDAR-only configurations.

While dynamic sparse attention methods offer input-adaptive efficiency, they face fundamental trade-offs: requiring preprocessing, lacking global evaluation, violating query independence, or incurring high computational overhead. We present RRAttention, a novel dynamic sparse attention method that simultaneously achieves all desirable properties through a head \\underline{r}ound-\\underline{r}obin (RR) sampling strategy. By rotating query sampling positions across attention heads within each stride, RRAttention maintains query independence while enabling efficient global pattern discovery with stride-level aggregation. Our method reduces complexity from $O(L^2)$ to $O(L^2/S^2)$ and employs adaptive Top-$τ$ selection for optimal sparsity. Extensive experiments on natural language understanding (HELMET) and multimodal video comprehension (Video-MME) demonstrate that RRAttention recovers over 99\\% of full attention performance while computing only half of the attention blocks, achieving 2.4$\\times$ speedup at 128K context length and outperforming existing dynamic sparse attention methods.",

      "abstract": "We use the theory of algebraic effects to give a complete equational axiomatization for dynamic threads. Our method is based on parameterized algebraic theories, which give a concrete syntax for strong monads on functor categories, and are a convenient framework for names and binding. Our programs are built from the key primitives `fork' and `wait'. `Fork' creates a child thread and passes its name (thread ID) to the parent thread. `Wait' allows us to wait for given child threads to finish. We provide a parameterized algebraic theory built from fork and wait, together with basic atomic actions and laws such as associativity of `fork'. Our equational axiomatization is complete in two senses. First, for closed expressions, it completely captures equality of labelled posets (pomsets), an established model of concurrency: model complete. Second, any two open expressions are provably equal if they are equal under all closing substitutions: syntactically complete. The benefit of algebraic effects is that the semantic analysis can focus on the algebraic operations of fork and wait. We then extend the analysis to a simple concurrent programming language by giving operational and denotational semantics. The denotational semantics is built using the methods of parameterized algebraic theories and we show that it is sound, adequate, and fully abstract at first order for labelled-poset observations.",

      "abstract": "Training a neural network requires navigating a high-dimensional, non-convex loss surface to find parameters that minimize this loss. In many ways, it is surprising that optimizers such as stochastic gradient descent and ADAM can reliably locate minima which perform well on both the training and test data. To understand the success of training, a \"loss landscape\" community has emerged to study the geometry of the loss function and the dynamics of optimization, often using visualization techniques. However, these loss landscape studies have mostly been limited to machine learning for image classification. In the newer field of physics-informed machine learning, little work has been conducted to visualize the landscapes of losses defined not by regression to large data sets, but by differential operators acting on state fields discretized by neural networks. In this work, we provide a comprehensive review of the loss landscape literature, as well as a discussion of the few existing physics-informed works which investigate the loss landscape. We then use a number of the techniques we survey to empirically investigate the landscapes defined by the Deep Ritz and squared residual forms of the physics loss function. We find that the loss landscapes of physics-informed neural networks have many of the same properties as the data-driven classification problems studied in the literature. Unexpectedly, we find that the two formulations of the physics loss often give rise to similar landscapes, which appear smooth, well-conditioned, and convex in the vicinity of the solution. The purpose of this work is to introduce the loss landscape perspective to the scientific machine learning community, compare the Deep Ritz and the strong form losses, and to challenge prevailing intuitions about the complexity of the loss landscapes of physics-informed networks.",

We derive exact information-theoretic scaling laws for subspace recovery and prediction error, revealing how the hierarchical features of the target are sequentially learned through a cascade of phase transitions. We further show that these optimal rates are achieved by a simple, target-agnostic spectral estimator, which can be interpreted as the small learning-rate limit of gradient descent on the first-layer weights. Once an adapted representation is identified, the readout can be learned statistically optimally, using an efficient procedure. As a consequence, we provide a unified and rigorous explanation of scaling laws, plateau phenomena, and spectral structure in shallow neural networks trained on such hierarchical targets.",

      "abstract": "The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has catalyzed the development of autonomous agents capable of navigating complex environments. However, existing evaluations primarily adopt a deductive paradigm, where agents execute tasks based on explicitly provided rules and static goals, often within limited planning horizons. Crucially, this neglects the inductive necessity for agents to discover latent transition laws from experience autonomously, which is the cornerstone for enabling agentic foresight and sustaining strategic coherence. To bridge this gap, we introduce OdysseyArena, which re-centers agent evaluation on long-horizon, active, and inductive interactions. We formalize and instantiate four primitives, translating abstract transition dynamics into concrete interactive environments. Building upon this, we establish OdysseyArena-Lite for standardized benchmarking, providing a set of 120 tasks to measure an agent's inductive efficiency and long-horizon discovery. Pushing further, we introduce OdysseyArena-Challenge to stress-test agent stability across extreme interaction horizons (e.g., > 200 steps). Extensive experiments on 15+ leading LLMs reveal that even frontier models exhibit a deficiency in inductive scenarios, identifying a critical bottleneck in the pursuit of autonomous discovery in complex environments.

Our method aligns simulated next states produced by the model with realized next states observed from the environment, encouraging consistency between internal world simulations and actual environment dynamics in a pre-trained embedding space. Unlike next-state token prediction, which prioritizes token-level fidelity (i.e., reproducing exact wording) over semantic equivalence and can lead to model collapse, our method provides a more robust training signal and is empirically less susceptible to reward hacking than LLM-as-a-judge. We evaluate our method on ALFWorld and $τ^2$ Bench and observe significant gains over the base model, despite being entirely self-supervised. When combined with task-success rewards, our method outperforms direct task-success reward RL by 6.9 and 5.7 points on ALFWorld and $τ^2$ Bench respectively, while matching the performance of expert-data training.",

However, its effectiveness is severely hindered by inefficient credit assignment in long-horizon tasks and repetitive errors across tasks due to the lack of experience transfer. To address these challenges, we propose UI-Mem, a novel framework that enhances GUI online RL with a Hierarchical Experience Memory. Unlike traditional replay buffers, our memory accumulates structured knowledge, including high-level workflows, subtask skills, and failure patterns. These experiences are stored as parameterized templates that enable cross-task and cross-application transfer. To effectively integrate memory guidance into online RL, we introduce Stratified Group Sampling, which injects varying levels of guidance across trajectories within each rollout group to maintain outcome diversity, driving the unguided policy toward internalizing guided behaviors. Furthermore, a Self-Evolving Loop continuously abstracts novel strategies and errors to keep the memory aligned with the agent's evolving policy. Experiments on online GUI benchmarks demonstrate that UI-Mem significantly outperforms traditional RL baselines and static reuse strategies, with strong generalization to unseen applications.

First, we propose a novel strategy to learn efficient connections with no additional parameters and negligible computational overhead. Second, we introduce a novel convolutional Boolean architecture that exploits the locality with reduced number of Boolean operations than existing methods. Third, we propose an adaptive discretization strategy to reduce the accuracy drop when converting a continuous-valued network into a Boolean one.

      "abstract": "Finite nuclei constrain the dense-matter equation of state (EOS), yet they are self-bound quantum droplets far from the thermodynamic limit. Motivated by an analogy to quantum dots, we show that the nuclear chart nevertheless defines a mesoscopic regime in which mesoscopic chemical-potential analogs $\\{μ_B,μ_Q,μ_S\\}$ can be extracted directly from nuclear and hypernuclear binding energies after consistent Coulomb subtraction. These are discrete finite-difference response functions -- local slopes of the strong-interaction energy landscape -- not equilibrium grand-canonical chemical potentials. The nuclear chart itself supplies an \"ensemble of nearby droplets\": finite differences across neighboring nuclei suppress shell- and pairing-scale oscillations while retaining the smooth bulk trend, producing robust slopes without a macroscopic limit. Thus, the data provide empirical local derivatives that any strangeness-enabled EOS must reproduce near saturation. Mapping the measured (hyper)nuclear landscape at $T\\simeq 0$, we find smooth, numerically stable responses, including a large, negative strangeness chemical-potential analog, and we identify specific hypernuclear measurements that can directly test and sharpen these EOS constraints.",

      "abstract": "We propose NVS-HO, the first benchmark designed for novel view synthesis of handheld objects in real-world environments using only RGB inputs. Each object is recorded in two complementary RGB sequences: (1) a handheld sequence, where the object is manipulated in front of a static camera, and (2) a board sequence, where the object is fixed on a ChArUco board to provide accurate camera poses via marker detection. The goal of NVS-HO is to learn a NVS model that captures the full appearance of an object from (1), whereas (2) provides the ground-truth images used for evaluation. To establish baselines, we consider both a classical SfM pipeline and a state-of-the-art pre-trained feed-forward neural network (VGGT) as pose estimators, and train NVS models based on NeRF and Gaussian Splatting. Our experiments reveal significant performance gaps in current methods under unconstrained handheld conditions, highlighting the need for more robust approaches. NVS-HO thus offers a challenging real-world benchmark to drive progress in RGB-based novel view synthesis of handheld objects.",

      "abstract": "Statistical functions such as the moment-generating function, characteristic function, cumulant-generating function, and second characteristic function are cornerstone tools in classical statistics and probability theory. They provide a powerful means to analyze the statistical properties of a system and find applications in diverse fields, including statistical physics and field theory. While these functions are ubiquitous in classical theory, a quantum counterpart has remained elusive due to the fundamental hurdle of noncommutativity of operators. The lack of such a framework has obscured the deep connections between standard statistical measures and the non-classical features of quantum mechanics. Here, we establish a comprehensive framework for quantum statistical functions that transcends these limitations, naturally unifying the disparate languages of standard quantum statistics, quasiprobability distributions, and weak values. We show that these functions, defined as expectation values with respect to the purified state, naturally reproduce fundamental quantum statistical quantities like expectation values, variance, and covariance upon differentiation. Crucially, by extending this framework to include the concepts of pre- and post-selection, we define conditional quantum statistical functions that uniquely yield weak values and weak variance. We further demonstrate that multivariable quantum statistical functions, when defined with specific operator orderings, correspond to well-known quasiprobability distributions. Our framework provides a cohesive mathematical structure that not only reproduces standard quantum statistical measures but also incorporates nonclassical features of quantum mechanics, thus laying the foundation for a deeper understanding of quantum statistics.",

Our sample comprises 47 stars with no nearby Gaia counterparts. We characterize both overall and short-term variabilities, examining data dispersion and identifying periodicities. To validate our findings, we also compare the OGLE light curves with data from the MACHO and TESS missions. Variability is ubiquitous in our WR sample: about one third of stars display high variability, or four fifths if we include cases with moderate variations. The observed changes are found to be periodic in 11 cases, with timescales of 2-56 d. Such periodic variations originate in corotating wind structures, binary effects, or pulsations, thereby increasing the number of systems known to show these phenomena. Surprisingly, nine targets display (quasi-periodic) outbursts, making such changes a new type of WR variability. The variability shows a transient character, in about 30$\\%$ of the sample, with changing amplitudes for periodic signals or for outbursts (they even sometimes completely disappear from view). Finally, we identified six long-period variables, four of which have been confirmed by at least two independent surveys.",

While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate significant potential in TKGQA, current prompting strategies constrain their efficacy in two primary ways.

Second, static prompting limits model autonomy and generalization, as it lack optimization through dynamic interaction with temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) environments. To address these limitations, we propose \\textbf{TKG-Thinker}, a novel agent equipped with autonomous planning and adaptive retrieval capabilities for reasoning over TKGs. Specifically, TKG-Thinker performs in-depth temporal reasoning through dynamic multi-turn interactions with TKGs via a dual-training strategy. We first apply Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with chain-of thought data to instill core planning capabilities, followed by a Reinforcement Learning (RL) stage that leverages multi-dimensional rewards to refine reasoning policies under intricate temporal constraints. Experimental results on benchmark datasets with three open-source LLMs show that TKG-Thinker achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits strong generalization across complex TKGQA settings.",

Traditional network monitoring and visualization tools rely on aggregated metrics or static representations, which fail to capture the evolving relationships and structural dependencies between devices. Although Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a powerful way to learn from relational data, their internal representations often remain opaque and difficult to interpret for security-critical operations. Consequently, this work introduces an interpretable pipeline that generates directly visualizable low-dimensional representations by mapping high-dimensional embeddings onto a latent manifold. This projection enables the interpretable monitoring and interoperability of evolving network states, while integrated feature attribution techniques decode the specific characteristics shaping the manifold structure. The framework achieves a classification F1-score of 0.830 for intrusion detection while also highlighting phenomena such as concept drift. Ultimately, the presented approach bridges the gap between high-dimensional GNN embeddings and human-understandable network behavior, offering new insights for network administrators and security analysts.",

The framework is general and applies to both classical algorithms and deep learning reconstruction methods, including U-Nets, U-Net ensembles, and generative Diffusion models. Empirically, we demonstrate that deep reconstruction methods yield substantially tighter confidence regions than classical reconstructions, without sacrificing theoretical coverage guarantees. Our approach allows the detection of hallucinations in reconstructed images and provides interpretable visualizations of confidence regions. This establishes deep models not only as powerful estimators, but also as reliable tools for uncertainty-aware medical imaging.",

STProtein is designed to accurately predict unknown spatial protein expression using more accessible spatial multi-omics data, such as spatial transcriptomics. We believe that STProtein can effectively addresses the scarcity of spatial proteomics, accelerating the integration of spatial multi-omics and potentially catalyzing transformative breakthroughs in life sciences. This tool enables scientists to accelerate discovery by identifying complex and previously hidden spatial patterns of proteins within tissues, uncovering novel relationships between different marker genes, and exploring the biological \"Dark Matter\".",

      "abstract": "Vision-language models (VLMs) often generate massive visual tokens that greatly increase inference latency and memory footprint; while training-free token pruning offers a practical remedy, existing methods still struggle to balance local evidence and global context under aggressive compression. We propose Focus-Scan-Refine (FSR), a human-inspired, plug-and-play pruning framework that mimics how humans answer visual questions: focus on key evidence, then scan globally if needed, and refine the scanned context by aggregating relevant details. FSR first focuses on key evidence by combining visual importance with instruction relevance, avoiding the bias toward visually salient but query-irrelevant regions. It then scans for complementary context conditioned on the focused set, selecting tokens that are most different from the focused evidence. Finally, FSR refines the scanned context by aggregating nearby informative tokens into the scan anchors via similarity-based assignment and score-weighted merging, without increasing the token budget. Extensive experiments across multiple VLM backbones and vision-language benchmarks show that FSR consistently improves the accuracy-efficiency trade-off over existing state-of-the-art pruning methods.

This paper Proposes a perturbation-correction framework based on Loacal Randomized Neural Networks(LRaNNs) to overcome this limitation. In the initialization step, a satisisfactory based approximation is obtained by minimizing the original nonconvex residual, typically stagnating at a moderate accuracy level. Subsequently, in the correction step, a correction term is determined by solving a subproblem governed by a perturbation expansion around the base approximation. This reformulation yields a convex optimization problem for the output coefficients, which guarantees rapic convergence. We rigorously derive an a posteriori error estitmate, demonstrating that the total generalization error is governed by the discrete residual norm, quadrature error, and a controllable truncation error. Numerical experiments on nonlinear diffusion problems with irregular moving interfaces, gradient-dependent diffusivities, and high-contrast media demonstrate that the proposed method effectively overcomes the optimization plateau. The correction step yields a significant improvement of 4-6 order of magnitude in L^2 accuracy.",

We introduce XHugWBC, a novel cross-embodiment training framework that enables generalist humanoid control through: (1) physics-consistent morphological randomization, (2) semantically aligned observation and action spaces across diverse humanoid robots, and (3) effective policy architectures modeling morphological and dynamical properties. XHugWBC is not tied to any specific robot. Instead, it internalizes a broad distribution of morphological and dynamical characteristics during training. By learning motion priors from diverse randomized embodiments, the policy acquires a strong structural bias that supports zero-shot transfer to previously unseen robots.

      "abstract": "Wearable devices collect time-varying biobehavioral data, offering opportunities to investigate how behaviors influence health outcomes. However, these data often contain measurement error and excess zeros (due to nonwear, sedentary behavior, or connectivity issues), each characterized by subject-specific distributions. Current statistical methods fail to address these issues simultaneously. We introduce a novel modeling framework for zero-inflated and error-prone functional data by incorporating a subject-specific time-varying validity indicator that explicitly distinguishes structural zeros from intrinsic values. We iteratively estimate the latent functional covariates and zero-inflation probabilities via maximum likelihood, using basis expansions and linear mixed models to adjust for measurement error. To assess the effects of the recovered latent covariates, we apply joint quantile regression across multiple quantile levels. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that our approach significantly improves estimation accuracy over methods that only address measurement error, and joint estimation yields substantial improvements compared with fitting separate quantile regressions. Applied to a childhood obesity study, our approach effectively corrects for zero inflation and measurement error in step counts, yielding results that closely align with energy expenditure and supporting their use as a proxy for physical activity.",

      "abstract": "Recent advances in diffusion-based reinforcement learning (RL) methods have demonstrated promising results in a wide range of continuous control tasks. However, existing works in this field focus on the application of diffusion policies while leaving the diffusion critics unexplored. In fact, since policy optimization fundamentally relies on the critic, accurate value estimation is far more important than policy expressiveness. Furthermore, given the stochasticity of most reinforcement learning tasks, it has been confirmed that the critic is more appropriately depicted with a distributional model. Motivated by these points, we propose a novel distributional RL method with Diffusion Bridge Critics (DBC). DBC directly models the inverse cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the Q value. This allows us to accurately capture the value distribution and prevents it from collapsing into a trivial Gaussian distribution owing to the strong distribution-matching capability of the diffusion bridge. Moreover, we further derive an analytic integral formula to address discretization errors in DBC, which is essential in value estimation. To our knowledge, DBC is the first work to employ the diffusion bridge model as the critic. Notably, DBC is also a plug-and-play component and can be integrated into most existing RL frameworks. Experimental results on MuJoCo robot control benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of DBC compared with previous distributional critic models.",

Despite the increased performance of LLMs on public benchmarks, out of the box LLMs still have a hard time generating code that aligns with a private code repository not previously seen by the model's training data. Customizing code LLMs to a private repository provides a way to improve the model performance. In this paper we present our approach for automated LLM customization based on semantic scopes in the code. We evaluate LLMs on real industry cases with two private enterprise code repositories with two customization strategies: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and supervised Fine-Tuning (FT). Our mechanism for ingesting the repository's data and formulating the training data pairs with semantic scopes helps models to learn the underlying patterns specific to the repository, providing more precise code to developers and helping to boost their productivity. The code completions of moderately sized customized models can be significantly better than those of uncustomized models of much larger capacity. We also include an analysis of customization on two public benchmarks and present opportunities for future work.",

Here we show that the under-utilised chosen variance of the Gaussian process is important in the training of deep networks with sparsity inducing activation, such as a shifted and clipped ReLU, $\\text{CReLU}_{τ,m}(x)=\\min(\\max(x-τ,0),m)$. Specifically, initialisations leading to larger fixed Gaussian process variances, allow for improved expressivity with activation sparsity as large as 90% in DNNs and CNNs, and generally improve the stability of the training process. Enabling full, or near full, accuracy at such high levels of sparsity in the hidden layers suggests a promising mechanism to reduce the energy consumption of machine learning models involving fully connected layers.",

      "abstract": "Cylindrical data frequently arise across various scientific disciplines, including meteorology (e.g., wind direction and speed), oceanography (e.g., marine current direction and speed or wave heights), ecology (e.g., telemetry), and medicine (e.g., seasonality and intensity in disease onset). Such data often occur as spatially correlated series of intensities and angles, thereby representing dependent bivariate response vectors of linear and circular components. To accommodate both the circular-linear dependence and spatial autocorrelation, while remaining flexible in marginal specifications, copula-based models for cylindrical data have been developed in the literature. However, existing approaches typically treat the copula parameters as constants unrelated to covariates, and regression specifications for marginal distributions are frequently restricted to linear predictors, thereby ignoring spatial correlation. In this work, we propose a structured additive conditional copula regression model for cylindrical data. The circular component is modeled using a wrapped Gaussian process, and the linear component follows a distributional regression model. Both components allow for the inclusion of linear covariate effects. Furthermore, by leveraging the empirical equivalence between Gaussian random fields (GRFs) and Gaussian Markov random fields, our approach avoids the computational burden typically associated with GRFs, while simultaneously allowing for non-stationarity in the covariance structure. Posterior estimation is performed via Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation. We evaluate the proposed model in a simulation study and subsequently in an analysis of wind directions and speed in Germany.",

In this paper, we study cross-domain offline RL, where an offline dataset from another similar source domain can be accessed to enhance policy learning upon a target domain dataset. Directly merging the two datasets may lead to suboptimal performance due to potential dynamics mismatches. Existing approaches typically mitigate this issue through source domain transition filtering or reward modification, which, however, may lead to insufficient exploitation of the valuable source domain data. Instead, we propose to modify the source domain data into the target domain data. To that end, we leverage an inverse policy model and a reward model to correct the actions and rewards of source transitions, explicitly achieving alignment with the target dynamics. Since limited data may result in inaccurate model training, we further employ a forward dynamics model to retain corrected samples that better match the target dynamics than the original transitions. Consequently, we propose the Selective Transition Correction (STC) algorithm, which enables reliable usage of source domain data for policy adaptation. Experiments on various environments with dynamics shifts demonstrate that STC achieves superior performance against existing baselines.",

      "abstract": "The collision phenomenon of polyatomic gases is described by the collision operator of extended Boltzmann equation or the energy-exchange model in particle direct simulations, for example, the Borgnakke-Larsen model. However, as a collision kernel, it dose not guarantee the entrinsic detailed balance and is not integrable. In this work, the Pullin equation, which possesses an integrable collision kernel and satisfies the detailed balance constraint, is adopted as an extended Boltzmann equation for the theoretical analysis of near-continuum relaxation mechanisms. For clarity, only the translational and rotational degrees are considered in this work. Explicit analytical expressions for the temporal relaxation of macroscopic variables, including the stress force, (translational/rotational) temperature and heat flux, are obtained at the first time. This is achieved by approximating the distribution function in mixed Hermite and Laguerre for rotation and computing the collision operator moments, enabling a direct description of macroscopic non-equilibrium evolution. Base on the same elementary moment (integral) of collision operator, the macroscopic transport coefficients is found in Chapman-Enskog framework. The long-standing speculation, that thermal conduction coefficient should be depended on the degrees of thermal non-equilibrium, is rigorously confirmed and evaluated. When thermal equilibrium is enforced, the present thermal conduction coefficients can be degenerated to the famous results of Mason and Monchick. Given the correct relaxation rate, a Rykov-type novel relaxation model for Pullin equation is proposed. It can recover the interaction of transaltional and rotatioanl heat fluxes in relaxation process, which is ignored in the widely used Rykov equation. Finally, the precision of this new Rykov-type equation is examined using a series of benchmark test cases.",

The nematic response function is modeled as the difference of normalized reflectivity signals, revealing a pronounced sub-picosecond extremum in signal evolution that directly yields the characteristic electronic thermalization time. This method demonstrates that the NRFM is consistent with TTM fits of transient optical response, yielding electronic thermalization time constants on the order of 110--230~fs for the FeSe$_{1-x}$Te$_x$ and Ba(Fe$_{0.92}$Co$_{0.08}$)$_2$As$_2$ thin films.

The accuracy of PMT waveform reconstruction directly impacts the detector's spatial and energy resolution. A key challenge arises when multiple photons arrive within a few nanoseconds, making it difficult to resolve individual photoelectrons (PEs). Although supervised deep learning methods have surpassed traditional methods in performance, their practical applicability is limited by the lack of ground-truth PE labels in real data. To address this issue, we propose an innovative weakly supervised waveform simulation and reconstruction approach based on a bidirectional conditional diffusion network framework. The method is fully data-driven and requires only raw waveforms and coarse estimates of PE information as input. It first employs a PE-conditioned diffusion model to simulate realistic waveforms from PE sequences, thereby learning the features of overlapping waveforms. Subsequently, these simulated waveforms are used to train a waveform-conditioned diffusion model to reconstruct the PE sequences from waveforms, reinforcing the learning of features of overlapping waveforms. Through iterative refinement between the two conditional diffusion processes, the model progressively improves reconstruction accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves 99% of the normalized PE-number resolution averaged over 1-5 p.e. and 80% of the timing resolution attained by fully supervised learning.",

Although existing reinforcement learning (RL)-based training frameworks like RLinf can enhance model generalization, they still rely on synchronous execution, leading to severe resource underutilization and throughput limitations during environment interaction, policy generation (rollout), and model update phases (actor). To overcome this challenge, this paper, for the first time, proposes and implements a fully-asynchronous policy training framework encompassing the entire pipeline from environment interaction, rollout generation, to actor policy updates. Systematically drawing inspiration from asynchronous optimization ideas in large model RL, our framework designs a multi-level decoupled architecture. This includes asynchronous parallelization of environment interaction and trajectory collection, streaming execution for policy generation, and decoupled scheduling for training updates. We validated the effectiveness of our method across diverse VLA models and environments. On the LIBERO benchmark, the framework achieves throughput improvements of up to 59.25\\% compared to existing synchronous strategies. When deeply optimizing separation strategies, throughput can be increased by as much as 126.67\\%. We verified the effectiveness of each asynchronous component via ablation studies. Scaling law validation across 8 to 256 GPUs demonstrates our method's excellent scalability under most conditions.",

We simulate two setups: first, molecules prepared in the first excited electronic state, second, a pump-probe scheme starting from the ground state.

To address this, we propose LongR, a unified framework that enhances long-context performance by integrating a dynamic \"Think-and-Read\" mechanism, which interleaves reasoning with document consultation, with a contextual density reward based on relative information gain to quantify the utility of the relevant documents. Empirically, LongR achieves a 9% gain on LongBench v2 and consistent improvements on RULER and InfiniteBench, demonstrating robust efficiency in navigating extensive contexts. Furthermore, LongR consistently enhances performance across diverse RL algorithms (e.g., DAPO, GSPO).

      "abstract": "Monocular 3D pose estimation is fundamentally ill-posed due to depth ambiguity and occlusions, thereby motivating probabilistic methods that generate multiple plausible 3D pose hypotheses. In particular, diffusion-based models have recently demonstrated strong performance, but their iterative denoising process typically requires many timesteps for each prediction, making inference computationally expensive. In contrast, we leverage Flow Matching (FM) to learn a velocity field defined by an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE), enabling efficient generation of 3D pose samples with only a few integration steps. We propose a novel generative pose estimation framework, FMPose3D, that formulates 3D pose estimation as a conditional distribution transport problem. It continuously transports samples from a standard Gaussian prior to the distribution of plausible 3D poses conditioned only on 2D inputs. Although ODE trajectories are deterministic, FMPose3D naturally generates various pose hypotheses by sampling different noise seeds. To obtain a single accurate prediction from those hypotheses, we further introduce a Reprojection-based Posterior Expectation Aggregation (RPEA) module, which approximates the Bayesian posterior expectation over 3D hypotheses. FMPose3D surpasses existing methods on the widely used human pose estimation benchmarks Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP, and further achieves state-of-the-art performance on the 3D animal pose datasets Animal3D and CtrlAni3D, demonstrating strong performance across both 3D pose domains.

Our proof uses the logarithmic coordinates \\(H(t)=F(e^t)+1\\), where the composition law becomes d'Alembert's functional equation on \\(\\R\\). The calibration provides the minimal regularity needed to invoke the classical classification of continuous solutions and fixes the remaining scaling freedom, selecting the hyperbolic-cosine branch. We also establish necessity of each assumption: without calibration the composition law admits a continuous one-parameter family, without the composition law the calibration does not determine the global form, and without regularity the composition law admits pathological non-measurable solutions. Finally, we establish a stability estimate for approximate solutions under bounded defect and characterize some properties of the canonical cost.",

Yet, this advantage is often demonstrated using image datasets only, and it is unclear whether it addresses the fundamental limitations of $k$-means clustering. Deep Embedded Clustering (DEC) learns a latent representation via an autoencoder and performs clustering based on a $k$-means-like procedure, while the optimization is conducted in an end-to-end manner. This paper investigates whether the deep-learned representation has enabled DEC to overcome the known fundamental limitations of $k$-means clustering, i.e., its inability to discover clusters of arbitrary shapes, varied sizes and densities. Our investigations on DEC have a wider implication on deep clustering methods in general. Notably, none of these methods exploit the underlying data distribution. We uncover that a non-deep learning approach achieves the intended aim of deep clustering by making use of distributional information of clusters in a dataset to effectively address these fundamental limitations.",

Contrastive learning is employed to help the model focus on meaningful disc features and reduce sensitivity to irrelevant differences in image appearance. The framework includes an auxiliary regression task for disc localization and applies weighted focal loss to address class imbalance. Experiments demonstrate a 78.1% balanced accuracy and a reduced severe-to-normal misclassification rate of 2.13% compared with supervised training from scratch.

      "abstract": "In this paper, we present a neuro-inspired approach to reservoir computing (RC) in which a network of in vitro cultured cortical neurons serves as the physical reservoir. Rather than relying on artificial recurrent models to approximate neural dynamics, our biological reservoir computing (BRC) system leverages the spontaneous and stimulus-evoked activity of living neural circuits as its computational substrate. A high-density multi-electrode array (HD-MEA) provides simultaneous stimulation and readout across hundreds of channels: input patterns are delivered through selected electrodes, while the remaining ones capture the resulting high-dimensional neural responses, yielding a biologically grounded feature representation. A linear readout layer (single-layer perceptron) is then trained to classify these reservoir states, enabling the living neural network to perform static visual pattern-recognition tasks within a computer-vision framework. We evaluate the system across a sequence of tasks of increasing difficulty, ranging from pointwise stimuli to oriented bars, clock-digit-like shapes, and handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. Despite the inherent variability of biological neural responses-arising from noise, spontaneous activity, and inter-session differences-the system consistently generates high-dimensional representations that support accurate classification. These results demonstrate that in vitro cortical networks can function as effective reservoirs for static visual pattern recognition, opening new avenues for integrating living neural substrates into neuromorphic computing frameworks. More broadly, this work contributes to the effort to incorporate biological principles into machine learning and supports the goals of neuro-inspired vision by illustrating how living neural systems can inform the design of efficient and biologically grounded computational models.",

      "abstract": "Search behaviour is characterised using synonymy and polysemy as users often want to search information based on meaning. Semantic representation strategies represent a move towards richer associative connections that can adequately capture this complex usage of language. Vector Space Modelling (VSM) and neural word embeddings play a crucial role in modern machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipelines. Embeddings use distributional semantics to represent words, sentences, paragraphs or entire documents as vectors in high dimensional spaces. This can be leveraged by Information Retrieval (IR) systems to exploit the semantic relatedness between queries and answers.   This paper evaluates an alternative approach to measuring query statement similarity that moves away from the common similarity measure of centroids of neural word embeddings. Motivated by the Word Movers Distance (WMD) model, similarity is evaluated using the distance between individual words of queries and statements. Results from ranked query and response statements demonstrate significant gains in accuracy using the combined approach of similarity ranking through WMD with the word embedding techniques. The top performing WMD + GloVe combination outperforms all other state-of-the-art retrieval models including Doc2Vec and the baseline LSA model. Along with the significant gains in performance of similarity ranking through WMD, we conclude that the use of pre-trained word embeddings, trained on vast amounts of data, result in domain agnostic language processing solutions that are portable to diverse business use-cases.",

To present the new ideas in a nutshell, we start by giving (in Section 1) a \"formula proof\" of the Lindelöf hypothesis.

However, existing multi-hop RAG systems remain inefficient, as they alternate between retrieval and reasoning at each step, resulting in repeated LLM calls, high token consumption, and unstable entity grounding across hops. We propose CompactRAG, a simple yet effective framework that decouples offline corpus restructuring from online reasoning.   In the offline stage, an LLM reads the corpus once and converts it into an atomic QA knowledge base, which represents knowledge as minimal, fine-grained question-answer pairs. In the online stage, complex queries are decomposed and carefully rewritten to preserve entity consistency, and are resolved through dense retrieval followed by RoBERTa-based answer extraction. Notably, during inference, the LLM is invoked only twice in total - once for sub-question decomposition and once for final answer synthesis - regardless of the number of reasoning hops.   Experiments on HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHopQA, and MuSiQue demonstrate that CompactRAG achieves competitive accuracy while substantially reducing token consumption compared to iterative RAG baselines, highlighting a cost-efficient and practical approach to multi-hop reasoning over large knowledge corpora.

Nonetheless, these systems are susceptible to tampering, whether from deliberate vandalism or harsh environmental conditions, which can undermine their monitoring effectiveness. In this context, detecting camera tampering is more challenging when a camera is capturing still images rather than video as there is no sequence of continuous frames over time. In this study, we propose two approaches for detecting tampered images: a rule-based method and a deep-learning-based method. The aim is to evaluate how each method performs in terms of accuracy, computational demands, and the data required for training when applied to real-world scenarios. Our results show that the deep-learning model provides higher accuracy, while the rule-based method is more appropriate for scenarios where resources are limited and a prolonged calibration phase is impractical. We also offer publicly available datasets with normal, blurred, and rotated images to support the development and evaluation of camera tampering detection methods, addressing the need for such resources.",

To that end, a commonly used tool is the Statistical Queries (SQ) framework, which studies performance limits of algorithms based on noisy interaction with the data. However, it is known that the formal connection between the SQ framework and SGD is tenuous: Existing results typically rely on adversarial or specially-structured gradient noise that does not reflect the noise in standard SGD, and (as we point out here) can sometimes lead to incorrect predictions. Moreover, many analyses of SGD for challenging problems rely on non-trivial algorithmic modifications, such as restricting the SGD trajectory to the sphere or using very small learning rates. To address these shortcomings, we develop a new, non-SQ framework to study the limitations of standard vanilla SGD, for single-index and multi-index models (namely, when the target function depends on a low-dimensional projection of the inputs). Our results apply to a broad class of settings and architectures, including (potentially deep) neural networks.",

Here, we investigate neural scaling laws for a paradigmatic materials science task: predicting the dielectric function of metals, a high-dimensional response that governs how solids interact with light. Using over 200,000 dielectric functions from high-throughput ab initio calculations, we study two multi-objective graph neural networks trained to predict the frequency-dependent complex interband dielectric function and the Drude frequency.

The Ellis & Baldwin formula provides a theoretical link between the intrinsic dipole anisotropy in the sky distribution of extragalactic light sources and the observer's velocity relative to the cosmic rest frame, under the assumptions that the sources follow a power-law luminosity function and exhibit power-law spectral energy distributions. In this work, we demonstrate that this relation can be generalized to arbitrary luminosity distributions and spectral profiles. We derive the corresponding expression for the effective spectral index and apply it to a sample of quasars observed in the W1 band of the CatWISE survey. We show that the anomalous cosmic dipole persists beyond the power-law assumption. These results provide a more general and robust framework to interpret measurements of the cosmic dipole in future large-scale surveys.",

      "abstract": "In this work, we analyze a penalized variant of the φ-FEM scheme for the Poisson equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions. The φ-FEM is a recently introduced unfitted finite element method based on a level-set description of the geometry, which avoids the need for boundary-fitted meshes. Unlike the original φ-FEM formulation, the method proposed here enforces boundary conditions through a penalization term. This approach has the advantage that the level-set function is required only on the cells adjacent to the boundary in the variational formulation. The scheme is stabilized using a ghost penalty technique. We derive a priori error estimates, showing optimal convergence in the H1 semi-norm and quasi-optimal convergence in the L2 norm under suitable regularity assumptions. Numerical experiments are presented to validate the theoretical results and to compare the proposed method with both the original φ-FEM and the standard fitted finite element method.",

Despite the impressive machine translation capabilities demonstrated by large language models (LLMs), domain adaptation still remains a challenge for LLMs. Existing MDMT methods such as in-context learning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning often suffer from domain shift, parameter interference and limited generalization. In this work, we propose a neuron-efficient fine-tuning framework for MDMT that identifies and updates consensus-aligned neurons within LLMs. These neurons are selected by maximizing the mutual information between neuron behavior and domain features, enabling LLMs to capture both generalizable translation patterns and domain-specific nuances. Our method then fine-tunes LLMs guided by these neurons, effectively mitigating parameter interference and domain-specific overfitting. Comprehensive experiments on three LLMs across ten German-English and Chinese-English translation domains evidence that our method consistently outperforms strong PEFT baselines on both seen and unseen domains, achieving state-of-the-art performance.",

We introduce new techniques to integrate residual queries into state-of-the-art adaptive mechanisms such as AIM. Our contributions include a novel conceptual framework for residual queries using multi-dimensional arrays, lazy updating strategies, and adaptive optimization of the per-round privacy budget allocation. Together these contributions reduce error, improve speed, and simplify residual query operations. We integrate these innovations into a new mechanism (AIM+GReM), which improves AIM by using fast residual-based reconstruction instead of a graphical model approach. Our mechanism is orders of magnitude faster than the original framework and demonstrates competitive error and greatly improved scalability.",

This comparison enables us to specify precisely which fundamental proactive practices the agent did not enact in situ. We conclude that, so long as multimodal voice agents cannot produce environmentally occasioned vision-based actions, they will lack a key resource relied upon by human remote sighted assistants.",

Here we show that this belief can fail in a fundamental and irreversible way. We identify a structural regime in which standard inference procedures converge smoothly, remain well calibrated, and pass conventional diagnostic checks, yet systematically converge to incorrect conclusions. This failure arises when the reliability of observations degrades in a manner that is intrinsically unobservable to the inference process itself. Using minimal synthetic experiments, we demonstrate that in this regime additional data do not correct error but instead amplify it, while residual-based and goodness-of-fit diagnostics remain misleadingly normal. These results reveal an intrinsic limit of data-driven science: stability, convergence, and confidence are not sufficient indicators of epistemic validity. We argue that inference cannot be treated as an unconditional consequence of data availability, but must instead be governed by explicit constraints on the integrity of the observational process.",

Among diverse paradigms, graph stands out as a powerful structure for agent memory due to the intrinsic capabilities to model relational dependencies, organize hierarchical information, and support efficient retrieval. This survey presents a comprehensive review of agent memory from the graph-based perspective. First, we introduce a taxonomy of agent memory, including short-term vs. long-term memory, knowledge vs. experience memory, non-structural vs. structural memory, with an implementation view of graph-based memory. Second, according to the life cycle of agent memory, we systematically analyze the key techniques in graph-based agent memory, covering memory extraction for transforming the data into the contents, storage for organizing the data efficiently, retrieval for retrieving the relevant contents from memory to support reasoning, and evolution for updating the contents in the memory. Third, we summarize the open-sourced libraries and benchmarks that support the development and evaluation of self-evolving agent memory. We also explore diverse application scenarios. Finally, we identify critical challenges and future research directions. This survey aims to offer actionable insights to advance the development of more efficient and reliable graph-based agent memory systems.

The model integrates an any-quantile forecasting paradigm with a dual-track recurrent architecture that jointly processes series-specific and cross-regional contextual information, supported by dilated recurrent cells, patch-based temporal modeling, and a dynamic ensemble mechanism.   The proposed framework enables the estimation of calibrated conditional quantiles at arbitrary probability levels within a single trained model and effectively exploits spatial dependencies to enhance robustness at the system level. The approach is evaluated using 30 years of hourly PV generation data from 259 European regions and compared against established statistical and neural probabilistic baselines. The results demonstrate consistent improvements in forecast accuracy, calibration, and prediction interval quality, underscoring the suitability of the proposed method for uncertainty-aware energy management and operational decision-making in renewable-dominated power systems.",

This formulation provides an analytic dispersion relation for three-dimensional ellipsoidal disturbances and remains computationally efficient at arbitrary harmonic degree, in contrast to the virial tensor method or to short-wavelength (WKB) approximations. The viscous effects are incorporated through a boundary-layer analysis based on Prandtls theory, leading to first-order viscous corrections to the inviscid spectrum and allowing a systematic investigation of viscosity-driven instabilities. Stability diagrams are presented over the space of admissible Riemann ellipsoids, illustrating the roles of rotation, internal strain, and diffusion, with implications for rotating shear flows in geophysical and astrophysical contexts.",

      "abstract": "Nonlinear SU(1,1) quantum interferometers based on non-degenerate optical parametric down-conversion exhibit strong unbalanced group velocity dispersion (GVD). This feature is intrinsic to this type of interferometer as correlated photons of vastly different frequencies propagate through a dispersive nonlinear crystal; consequently, the dispersion arises from the source itself. The resulting GVD degrades the axial point-spread function (PSF) in optical coherence tomography (OCT) with undetected photons; and physical compensation is less straightforward, in particular for non-degenerate broadband regimes due to the limited number of suitable materials. In this contribution, we analyze dispersion in bulk nonlinear interferometry and describe its implications for OCT imaging. Aspects of hardware compensation are addressed, and a novel empirical numerical method of compensation is proposed. The approach is based on the extraction of the phase component directly from the time-domain modality (high precision linearized quantum Fourier transform infrared spectrometer) and its injection into the mid-IR spectral-domain OCT signals (central wavelength of around 3770 nm) before the Fourier transform. The proposed method is compared with an alternative numerical technique. The results demonstrate a 2.2-fold improvement in axial resolution and outperform the alternative correction method in overall imaging performance.",

      "abstract": "Datalog is an increasingly popular recursive query language that is declarative by design, meaning its programs must be translated by an engine into the actual physical execution plan. When generating this plan, a central decision is how to physically represent all involved relations, an aspect in which existing Datalog engines are surprisingly restrictive and often resort to one-size-fits-all solutions. The reason for this is that the typical execution plan of a Datalog program not only performs a single type of operation against the physical representations, but a mixture of operations, such as insertions, lookups, and containment-checks. Further, the relevance of each operation type highly depends on the workload characteristics, which range from familiar properties such as the size, multiplicity, and arity of the individual relations to very specific Datalog properties, such as the \"interweaving\" of rules when relations occur multiple times, and in particular the recursiveness of the query which might generate new tuples on the fly during evaluation. This indicates that a variety of physical representations, each with its own strengths and weaknesses, is required to meet the specific needs of different workload situations. To evaluate this, we conduct an in-depth experimental study of the interplay between potentially suitable physical representations and seven dimensions of workload characteristics that vary across actual Datalog programs, revealing which properties actually matter. Based on these insights, we design an automatic selection mechanism that utilizes a set of decision trees to identify suitable physical representations for a given workload.",

In-context learning methods fit and predict in one forward pass without parameter updates by leveraging the training data as context for predicting on query test points. While recent tabular foundation models achieve state-of-the-art performance, their transformer architecture based on the attention mechanism has quadratic complexity regarding dataset size, which in turn increases the overhead on training and inference time, and limits the capacity of the models to handle large-scale datasets. In this work, we propose TACO, an end-to-end tabular compression model that compresses the training dataset in a latent space. We test our method on the TabArena benchmark, where our proposed method is up to 94x faster in inference time, while consuming up to 97\\% less memory compared to the state-of-the-art tabular transformer architecture, all while retaining performance without significant degradation. Lastly, our method not only scales better with increased dataset sizes, but it also achieves better performance compared to other baselines.",

The results show that our comprehensive improvements to the network structure of NoisyNet, exploration control, and training stability contribute to enhancing the efficiency and reliability of deep Q-learning.",

      "abstract": "Lightweight cryptography is becoming essential as emerging technologies in digital identity systems and Internet of Things verification continue to demand strong cryptographic assurance on devices with limited processing power, memory, and energy resources. As these technologies move into routine use, they demand cryptographic primitives that maintain strong security and deliver predictable performance through clear theoretical models of time complexity. Although NIST's lightweight cryptography project provides empirical evaluations of the ten finalist algorithms, a unified theoretical understanding of their time-complexity behavior remains absent. This work introduces a symbolic model that decomposes each scheme into initialization, data-processing, and finalization phases, enabling formal time-complexity derivation for all ten finalists. The results clarify how design parameters shape computational scaling on constrained mobile and embedded environments. The framework provides a foundation needed to distinguish algorithmic efficiency and guides the choice of primitives capable of supporting security systems in constrained environments.",

      "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards has recently advanced the capabilities of Large Language Models in complex reasoning tasks by providing explicit rule-based supervision. Among RLVR methods, GRPO and its variants have achieved strong empirical performance. Despite their success, we identify that they suffer from Gradient Misassignment in Positives and Gradient Domination in Negatives, which lead to inefficient and suboptimal policy updates. To address these issues, we propose Rewards as Labels (REAL), a novel framework that revisits verifiable rewards as categorical labels rather than scalar weights, thereby reformulating policy optimization as a classification problem. Building on this, we further introduce anchor logits to enhance policy learning. Our analysis reveals that REAL induces a monotonic and bounded gradient weighting, enabling balanced gradient allocation across rollouts and effectively mitigating the identified mismatches. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that REAL improves training stability and consistently outperforms GRPO and strong variants such as DAPO. On the 1.5B model, REAL improves average Pass@1 over DAPO by 6.7%. These gains further scale to 7B model, REAL continues to outperform DAPO and GSPO by 6.2% and 1.7%, respectively. Notably, even with a vanilla binary cross-entropy, REAL remains stable and exceeds DAPO by 4.5% on average.",

Safe deployment requires thorough testing in diverse real-world scenarios and compliance with traffic laws like speed limits, signal obedience, and right-of-way rules. Violations like running red lights or speeding pose severe safety risks. However, current testing approaches face significant challenges: limited ability to generate complex and high-risk law-breaking scenarios, and failing to account for complex interactions involving multiple vehicles and critical situations. To address these challenges, we propose ROMAN, a novel scenario generation approach for ADS testing that combines a multi-head attention network with a traffic law weighting mechanism. ROMAN is designed to generate high-risk violation scenarios to enable more thorough and targeted ADS evaluation. The multi-head attention mechanism models interactions among vehicles, traffic signals, and other factors. The traffic law weighting mechanism implements a workflow that leverages an LLM-based risk weighting module to evaluate violations based on the two dimensions of severity and occurrence. We have evaluated ROMAN by testing the Baidu Apollo ADS within the CARLA simulation platform and conducting extensive experiments to measure its performance. Experimental results demonstrate that ROMAN surpassed state-of-the-art tools ABLE and LawBreaker by achieving 7.91% higher average violation count than ABLE and 55.96% higher than LawBreaker, while also maintaining greater scenario diversity. In addition, only ROMAN successfully generated violation scenarios for every clause of the input traffic laws, enabling it to identify more high-risk violations than existing approaches.",

Using linear chains of up to nine \\Ca ions and six \\Sr ions, we demonstrate improved stability as a function of the number of ions that are contributing to the laser frequency stabilization servo. The measured joint fractional frequency stability of the two clocks reaches $1.37(12)\\times 10^{-15}$ at one second, placing an upper bound on the same stability of one of the clocks at $9.6(8)\\times 10^{-16}$ in one second.

Our direct measurement represents an order of magnitude improvement compared to existing indirect frequency ratio measurements. Furthermore, by combining our results with recent absolute frequency measurements of the \\Sr transition, referenced to a primary frequency standard, we refined the absolute frequency of the \\Ca transition to $ν_{\\text{Ca}^+}=411042129776400.21(4)$ Hz, reducing its uncertainty by a factor of three.

      "abstract": "Exact inference in complex probabilistic models often incurs prohibitive computational costs. This challenge is particularly acute for autonomous agents in dynamic environments that require frequent, real-time belief updates. Existing methods are often inefficient for ongoing reasoning, as they re-evaluate the entire model upon any change, failing to exploit that real-world information streams have heterogeneous update rates. To address this, we approach the problem from a reactive, asynchronous, probabilistic reasoning perspective. We first introduce Resin (Reactive Signal Inference), a probabilistic programming language that merges probabilistic logic with reactive programming. Furthermore, to provide efficient and exact semantics for Resin, we propose Reactive Circuits (RCs). Formulated as a meta-structure over Algebraic Circuits and asynchronous data streams, RCs are time-dynamic Directed Acyclic Graphs that autonomously adapt themselves based on the volatility of input signals. In high-fidelity drone swarm simulations, our approach achieves several orders of magnitude of speedup over frequency-agnostic inference. We demonstrate that RCs' structural adaptations successfully capture environmental dynamics, significantly reducing latency and facilitating reactive real-time reasoning. By partitioning computations based on the estimated Frequency of Change in the asynchronous inputs, large inference tasks can be decomposed into individually memoized sub-problems. This ensures that only the specific components of a model affected by new information are re-evaluated, drastically reducing redundant computation in streaming contexts.",

XSIM extends 3DGUT splatting with a generalized rolling-shutter modeling tailored for autonomous driving applications. Our framework provides a unified and flexible formulation for appearance and geometric sensor modeling, enabling rendering of complex sensor distortions in dynamic environments. We identify spherical cameras, such as LiDARs, as a critical edge case for existing 3DGUT splatting due to cyclic projection and time discontinuities at azimuth boundaries leading to incorrect particle projection. To address this issue, we propose a phase modeling mechanism that explicitly accounts temporal and shape discontinuities of Gaussians projected by the Unscented Transform at azimuth borders. In addition, we introduce an extended 3D Gaussian representation that incorporates two distinct opacity parameters to resolve mismatches between geometry and color distributions. As a result, our framework provides enhanced scene representations with improved geometric consistency and photorealistic appearance. We evaluate our framework extensively on multiple autonomous driving datasets, including Waymo Open Dataset, Argoverse 2, and PandaSet. Our framework consistently outperforms strong recent baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performance across all datasets.

A key issue is the freezing robot problem, where the robot struggles to find safe motions and becomes stuck within the crowd. To address this, we propose HiCrowd, a hierarchical framework that integrates reinforcement learning (RL) with model predictive control (MPC). HiCrowd leverages surrounding pedestrian motion as guidance, enabling the robot to align with compatible crowd flows. A high-level RL policy generates a follow point to align the robot with a suitable pedestrian group, while a low-level MPC safely tracks this guidance with short horizon planning. The method combines long-term crowd aware decision making with safe short-term execution. We evaluate HiCrowd against reactive and learning-based baselines in offline setting (replaying recorded human trajectories) and online setting (human trajectories are updated to react to the robot in simulation). Experiments on a real-world dataset and a synthetic crowd dataset show that our method outperforms in navigation efficiency and safety, while reducing freezing behaviors. Our results suggest that leveraging human motion as guidance, rather than treating humans solely as dynamic obstacles, provides a powerful principle for safe and efficient robot navigation in crowds.",

Cross-lingual knowledge transfer has emerged as a promising approach to address this challenge by leveraging resources from high-resource languages. In this paper, we investigate methods for transferring linguistic knowledge from high-resource languages to low-resource languages, where the number of labeled training instances is in hundreds. We focus on sentence-level and word-level tasks. We introduce a novel method, GETR (Graph-Enhanced Token Representation) for cross-lingual knowledge transfer along with two adopted baselines (a) augmentation in hidden layers and (b) token embedding transfer through token translation. Experimental results demonstrate that our GNN-based approach significantly outperforms existing multilingual and cross-lingual baseline methods, achieving 13 percentage point improvements on truly low-resource languages (Mizo, Khasi) for POS tagging, and 20 and 27 percentage point improvements in macro-F1 on simulated low-resource languages (Marathi, Bangla, Malayalam) across sentiment classification and NER tasks respectively. We also present a detailed analysis of the transfer mechanisms and identify key factors that contribute to successful knowledge transfer in this linguistic context.",

While recently published contributions achieve high success rates in locomotion tasks, scarce attention has been devoted to the development of methods that enable to handle hardware faults that may occur during the locomotion process. However, in real-world settings, environmental disturbances or sudden occurrences of hardware faults might yield severe consequences. To address these issues, this paper presents TOLEBI (A faulT-tOlerant Learning framEwork for Bipedal locomotIon) that handles faults on the robot during operation. Specifically, joint locking, power loss and external disturbances are injected in simulation to learn fault-tolerant locomotion strategies. In addition to transferring the learned policy to the real robot via sim-to-real transfer, an online joint status module incorporated. This module enables to classify joint conditions by referring to the actual observations at runtime under real-world conditions. The validation experiments conducted both in real-world and simulation with the humanoid robot TOCABI highlight the applicability of the proposed approach. To our knowledge, this manuscript provides the first learning-based fault-tolerant framework for bipedal locomotion, thereby fostering the development of efficient learning methods in this field.",

      "abstract": "Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) have progressively shifted from signature-based techniques toward machine learning and, more recently, deep learning methods. Meanwhile, the widespread adoption of encryption has reduced payload visibility, weakening inspection pipelines that depend on plaintext content and increasing reliance on flow-level telemetry such as NetFlow and IPFIX. Many current learning-based detectors still frame intrusion detection as per-flow classification, implicitly treating each flow record as an independent sample. This assumption is often violated in realistic attack campaigns, where evidence is distributed across multiple flows and hosts, spanning minutes to days through staged execution, beaconing, lateral movement, and exfiltration. This paper synthesizes recent research on context-aware deep learning for flow-based intrusion detection. We organize existing methods into a four-dimensional taxonomy covering temporal context, graph or relational context, multimodal context, and multi-resolution context. Beyond modeling, we emphasize rigorous evaluation and operational realism. We review common failure modes that can inflate reported results, including temporal leakage, data splitting, dataset design flaws, limited dataset diversity, and weak cross-dataset generalization. We also analyze practical constraints that shape deployability, such as streaming state management, memory growth, latency budgets, and model compression choices. Overall, the literature suggests that context can meaningfully improve detection when attacks induce measurable temporal or relational structure, but the magnitude and reliability of these gains depend strongly on rigorous, causal evaluation and on datasets that capture realistic diversity.",

      "abstract": "Immersive virtual reality (VR) applications demand accurate, temporally coherent full-body pose tracking. Recent head-mounted camera-based approaches show promise in egocentric pose estimation, but encounter challenges when applied to VR head-mounted displays (HMDs), including temporal instability, inaccurate lower-body estimation, and the lack of real-time performance. To address these limitations, we present EgoPoseVR, an end-to-end framework for accurate egocentric full-body pose estimation in VR that integrates headset motion cues with egocentric RGB-D observations through a dual-modality fusion pipeline. A spatiotemporal encoder extracts frame- and joint-level representations, which are fused via cross-attention to fully exploit complementary motion cues across modalities. A kinematic optimization module then imposes constraints from HMD signals, enhancing the accuracy and stability of pose estimation. To facilitate training and evaluation, we introduce a large-scale synthetic dataset of over 1.8 million temporally aligned HMD and RGB-D frames across diverse VR scenarios. Experimental results show that EgoPoseVR outperforms state-of-the-art egocentric pose estimation models. A user study in real-world scenes further shows that EgoPoseVR achieved significantly higher subjective ratings in accuracy, stability, embodiment, and intention for future use compared to baseline methods. These results show that EgoPoseVR enables robust full-body pose tracking, offering a practical solution for accurate VR embodiment without requiring additional body-worn sensors or room-scale tracking systems.",

These operators improve existing neural network interpolation operators by incorporating Taylor polynomials at the sampling nodes, thereby exploiting the higher smoothness of the target function. The proposed operators are shown to be well defined, uniformly bounded, and to satisfy an exact interpolation property at the grid points. In addition, polynomial reproduction up to a prescribed degree is established. Direct approximation estimates are derived in terms of higher-order moduli of smoothness, yielding enhanced convergence rates for sufficiently smooth functions. Numerical experiments are presented to support the theoretical analysis and to demonstrate the significant accuracy improvement achieved through the Taylor-accelerated construction. In particular, higher-order convergence on irregular grids is obtained, and the proposed approach outperforms existing neural network interpolation operators on irregular partitions, including Lagrange-based schemes.",

      "abstract": "Hyperaccreting stellar-mass black hole systems are leading candidates for the central engines of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Their jets are thought to be powered by either the Blandford-Znajek (BZ) process or neutrino-dominated accretion flows (NDAFs), but discriminating between these mechanisms remains challenging. To address this, we propose using the luminosity decay slope (parameter d) of GRB light curves to distinguish between the BZ and NDAF mechanisms, thereby linking the light-curve morphology to the central engine physics. By analysing 85 single-peaked GRBs with fast-rise, exponential-decay (FRED) profiles observed by Swift/BAT using 64 ms background-subtracted light curves, we fit the decay slope (parameter d) with the empirical Kocevski-Ryde-Liang (KRL) function and compare the results with theoretical predictions for the BZ (d approximately 1.67) and the NDAF (d approximately 3.7 to 7.8) mechanisms. We find that the decay slope (parameter d) can differentiate central engine mechanisms, with 15 GRBs consistent with the BZ mechanism and 22 supporting the NDAF mechanism. However, most events exhibit slopes within the range between 2 and 4, suggesting a hybrid of mechanisms, with NDAF being dominant.",

Our aim is to sense a remote target shape with the collected signals which consist of both the reflection and scattering signals. We first characterize the mmWave's scattering and reflection effects based on the Lambertian scattering model. Then we apply the periodogram technique to obtain rough scattering point detection, and further incorporate the subspace method to achieve more precise scattering and reflection point detection. Based on these, a reconstruction algorithm based on Hough Transform and principal component analysis (PCA) is designed for a single convex polygon target scenario. To improve the accuracy and completeness of the reconstruction results, we propose a method to further fuse the scattering and reflection points.

While radio maps enable proactive mode selection, reconstructing high-fidelity maps from sparse measurements is challenging. Existing physics-agnostic or data-driven methods often fail to recover fine-grained shadowing details under extreme sparsity. We propose a Physics-Regularized Low-Rank Tensor Completion (PR-LRTC) framework for radio map reconstruction. By modeling the signal field as a three-way tensor, we integrate environmental low-rankness with deterministic antenna physics. Specifically, we leverage Effective Aerial Degrees-of-Freedom (EADoF) theory to derive a differential gain topology map as a physical prior for regularization. The resulting optimization problem is solved via an efficient Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM)-based algorithm. Simulations show that PR-LRTC achieves a 4 dB gain over baselines at a 10% sampling ratio. It effectively preserves sharp shadowing edges, providing a robust, physics-compliant solution for low-overhead beam management.",

      "abstract": "Atypical Parkinsonian Disorders (APD), also known as Parkinson-plus syndrome, are a group of neurodegenerative diseases that include progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and multiple system atrophy (MSA). In the early stages, overlapping clinical features often lead to misdiagnosis as Parkinson's disease (PD). Identifying reliable imaging biomarkers for early differential diagnosis remains a critical challenge. In this study, we propose a hybrid framework combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with machine learning (ML) techniques to classify APD subtypes versus PD and distinguish between the subtypes themselves: PSP vs. PD, MSA vs. PD, and PSP vs. MSA. The model leverages multi-modal input data, including T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), segmentation masks of 12 deep brain structures associated with APD, and their corresponding volumetric measurements. By integrating these complementary modalities, including image data, structural segmentation masks, and quantitative volume features, the hybrid approach achieved promising classification performance with area under the curve (AUC) scores of 0.95 for PSP vs. PD, 0.86 for MSA vs. PD, and 0.92 for PSP vs. MSA. These results highlight the potential of combining spatial and structural information for robust subtype differentiation. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that fusing CNN-based image features with volume-based ML inputs improves classification accuracy for APD subtypes. The proposed approach may contribute to more reliable early-stage diagnosis, facilitating timely and targeted interventions in clinical practice.",

      "abstract": "Structural shifts pose a significant challenge for graph neural networks, as graph topology acts as a covariate that can vary across domains. Existing domain generalization methods rely on fixed structural augmentations or training on globally perturbed graphs, mechanisms that do not pinpoint which specific edges encode domain-invariant information. We argue that domain-invariant structural information is not rigidly tied to a single topology but resides in the consensus across multiple graph structures derived from topology and feature similarity. To capture this, we first propose EdgeMask-DG, a novel min-max algorithm where an edge masker learns to find worst-case continuous masks subject to a sparsity constraint, compelling a task GNN to perform effectively under these adversarial structural perturbations. Building upon this, we introduce EdgeMask-DG*, an extension that applies this adversarial masking principle to an enriched graph. This enriched graph combines the original topology with feature-derived edges, allowing the model to discover invariances even when the original topology is noisy or domain-specific. EdgeMask-DG* is the first to systematically combine adaptive adversarial topology search with feature-enriched graphs. We provide a formal justification for our approach from a robust optimization perspective. We demonstrate that EdgeMask-DG* achieves new state-of-the-art performance on diverse graph domain generalization benchmarks, including citation networks, social networks, and temporal graphs. Notably, on the Cora OOD benchmark, EdgeMask-DG* lifts the worst-case domain accuracy to 78.0\\%, a +3.8 pp improvement over the prior state of the art (74.2\\%).

Graph prompt tuning offers a parameter-efficient alternative to fine-tuning, yet most methods only modify inputs or representations and leave message passing unchanged, limiting their ability to adapt neighborhood interactions. We propose message-adaptive graph prompt tuning, which injects learnable prompts into the message passing step to reweight incoming neighbor messages and add task-specific prompt vectors during message aggregation, while keeping the backbone GNN frozen. The approach is compatible with common GNN backbones and pre-training strategies, and applicable across downstream settings. Experiments on diverse node- and graph-level datasets show consistent gains over prior graph prompting methods in few-shot settings, while achieving performance competitive with fine-tuning in full-shot regimes.",

Unlike many previous datasets that focus on household or consumer products or use synthetic, clean tabletop datasets, or objects captured solely in controlled lab environments, IndustryShapes introduces five new object types with challenging properties, also captured in realistic industrial assembly settings.

This paper explores novel neural network (NN) architectures suitable for trajectory estimation and path determination in a mmWave multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) outdoor system based on localization data from beamformed fingerprint (BFF). The NN architecture captures sequences of BFF signals from different users, and through the application of learning mechanisms, subsequently estimate their trajectories. In turn, this information is employed to find the shortest path to the target, thereby enabling more efficient navigation. Specifically, we propose a two-stage procedure for trajectory estimation and optimal path finding. In the first stage, a transformer network (TN) based on attention mechanisms is developed to predict trajectories of wireless devices using BFF sequences captured in a mmWave MIMO outdoor system. In the second stage, a novel algorithm based on Informed Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (iRRT*) is employed to determine the optimal path to target locations using trajectory estimates derived in the first stage. The effectiveness of the proposed schemes is validated through numerical experiments, using a comprehensive dataset of radio measurements, generated using ray tracing simulations to model outdoor propagation at 28 GHz. We show that our proposed TN-based trajectory estimator outperforms other methods from the recent literature and can successfully generalize to new trajectories outside the training set. Furthermore, our proposed iRRT* algorithm is able to consistently provide the shortest path to the target.",

      "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), particularly GRPO, has become the standard for eliciting LLM reasoning. However, its efficiency in exploration and difficulty adaptation remains an open challenge. In this work, we argue that these bottlenecks stem from an implicit advantage symmetry inherent in Group Relative Advantage Estimation (GRAE). This symmetry induces two critical limitations: (i) at the group level, strict symmetry in weights between correct and incorrect trajectories leaves unsampled action logits unchanged, thereby hindering exploration of novel correct solution. (ii) at the sample level, the algorithm implicitly prioritizes medium-difficulty samples, remaining agnostic to the non-stationary demands of difficulty focus. Through controlled experiments, we reveal that this symmetric property is sub-optimal, yielding two pivotal insights: (i) asymmetrically suppressing the advantages of correct trajectories encourages essential exploration. (ii) learning efficiency is maximized by a curriculum-like transition-prioritizing simpler samples initially before gradually shifting to complex ones. Motivated by these findings, we propose Asymmetric GRAE (A-GRAE), which dynamically modulates exploration incentives and sample-difficulty focus. Experiments across seven benchmarks demonstrate that A-GRAE consistently improves GRPO and its variants across both LLMs and MLLMs.",

To mitigate this issue, we propose Singular Value Calibration (SVC), a training-free and data-free post-processing method that quantifies subspace overlap and rescales inflated singular values to restore a balanced spectrum. Across vision and language benchmarks, SVC consistently improves strong merging baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

This misalignment with human expectations, referred to as \\emph{misbehaviors} of LVLMs, raises serious concerns for deployment in critical applications. These misbehaviors are found to stem from epistemic uncertainty, specifically either conflicting internal knowledge or the absence of supporting information. However, existing uncertainty quantification methods, which typically capture only overall epistemic uncertainty, have shown limited effectiveness in identifying such issues. To address this gap, we propose Evidential Uncertainty Quantification (EUQ), a fine-grained method that captures both information conflict and ignorance for effective detection of LVLM misbehaviors. In particular, we interpret features from the model output head as either supporting (positive) or opposing (negative) evidence. Leveraging Evidence Theory, we model and aggregate this evidence to quantify internal conflict and knowledge gaps within a single forward pass. We extensively evaluate our method across four categories of misbehavior, including hallucinations, jailbreaks, adversarial vulnerabilities, and out-of-distribution (OOD) failures, using state-of-the-art LVLMs, and find that EUQ consistently outperforms strong baselines, showing that hallucinations correspond to high internal conflict and OOD failures to high ignorance. Furthermore, layer-wise evidential uncertainty dynamics analysis helps interpret the evolution of internal representations from a new perspective.

      "abstract": "Task-specific microscopy datasets are often too small to train deep learning models that learn robust feature representations. Self-supervised learning (SSL) can mitigate this by pretraining on large unlabeled datasets, but it remains unclear how well such representations transfer across microscopy domains with different staining protocols and channel configurations. We investigate the cross-domain transferability of DINO-pretrained Vision Transformers for protein localization on the OpenCell dataset. We generate image embeddings using three DINO backbones pretrained on ImageNet-1k, the Human Protein Atlas (HPA), and OpenCell, and evaluate them by training a supervised classification head on OpenCell labels. All pretrained models transfer well, with the microscopy-specific HPA-pretrained model achieving the best performance (mean macro $F_1$-score = 0.8221 \\pm 0.0062), slightly outperforming a DINO model trained directly on OpenCell (0.8057 \\pm 0.0090). These results highlight the value of large-scale pretraining and indicate that domain-relevant SSL representations can generalize effectively to related but distinct microscopy datasets, enabling strong downstream performance even when task-specific labeled data are limited.",

      "abstract": "Game-based assessments (GBAs) are increasingly adopted in recruitment contexts as tools to assess transversal skills through observable behavior. However, empirical evidence directly comparing game-based behavioral indicators with traditional self-report measures remains limited. This study adopts a method-comparison approach to explore the convergence between self-perceived and behaviorally enacted problem-solving competence, comparing a game-based assessment with the Problem Solving Inventory (PSI-B).   Seventy-eight participants completed both the PSI-B and a five-minute game-based problem-solving task, which classified performance into four behavioral proficiency levels. Results revealed no significant convergence between self-reported and behavior-based problem-solving scores, indicating a lack of convergence between the two measurement modalities.   Rather than indicating a lack of validity of the game-based assessment, these findings support the view that self-report and behavioral measures provide complementary information about problem-solving competence. The study highlights the risks of relying on a single assessment modality in personnel selection and underscores the value of integrating game-based tools within multi-method assessment frameworks.",

      "abstract": "Despite recent progress in calibration-free monocular SLAM via 3D vision foundation models, scale drift remains severe on long sequences. Motion-agnostic partitioning breaks contextual coherence and causes zero-motion drift, while conventional geometric alignment is computationally expensive. To address these issues, we propose VGGT-Motion, a calibration-free SLAM system for efficient and robust global consistency over kilometer-scale trajectories. Specifically, we first propose a motion-aware submap construction mechanism that uses optical flow to guide adaptive partitioning, prune static redundancy, and encapsulate turns for stable local geometry. We then design an anchor-driven direct Sim(3) registration strategy. By exploiting context-balanced anchors, it achieves search-free, pixel-wise dense alignment and efficient loop closure without costly feature matching. Finally, a lightweight submap-level pose graph optimization enforces global consistency with linear complexity, enabling scalable long-range operation. Experiments show that VGGT-Motion markedly improves trajectory accuracy and efficiency, achieving state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot, long-range calibration-free monocular SLAM.",

This paper examines how Computer Science students and instructors engage with LLMs across five scenarios: \"Writing\", \"Quiz\", \"Programming\", \"Project-based learning\", and \"Information retrieval\". Through user studies with 16 students and 6 instructors, we identify 7 key intents, including increasingly complex student practices. Findings reveal varying levels of conflict between student practices and instructor norms, ranging from clear conflict in \"Writing-generation\" and \"(Programming) quiz-solving\", through partial conflict in \"Programming project-implementation\" and \"Project-based learning\", to broad agreement in \"Writing-revision & ideation\", \"(Programming) quiz-correction\" and \"Info-query & summary\". We document instructors are shifting from prohibiting to recognizing students' use of LLMs for high-quality work, integrating usage records into assessment grading. Finally, we propose LLM design guidelines: deploying default guardrails with game-like and empathetic interaction to prevent students from \"deserting\" LLMs, especially for \"Writing-generation\", while utilizing comprehension checks in low-conflict intents to promote learning.",

We identify a significant subset of PG-Constraints, encoding denial constraints and including recursion as a key feature, while still permitting automata-based structural analyses of errors. We present a comprehensive repair pipeline for these constraints to repair Property Graphs, involving changes in the graph topology and leading to node, edge and, optionally, label deletions. We investigate three algorithmic strategies for the repair procedure, based on Integer Linear Programming (ILP), a naive, and an LP-guided greedy algorithm. Our experiments on various real-world datasets reveal that repairing with label deletions can achieve a 59% reduction in deletions compared to node/edge deletions. Moreover, the LP-guided greedy algorithm offers a runtime advantage of up to 97% compared to the ILP strategy, while matching the same quality.",

To obtain the regularity results for solutions to the linear parabolic equation and its dual equation, firstly, we construct several families of mollifiers adapted respectively to the Hörmander vector fields generating Carnot groups, Carnot tori and dual spaces of non-isotropic Hölder spaces; secondly, we use the theory of singular integral operators to establish stronger a priori regularity for the solutions.",

The 2025 workshop brought together developers of applications which rely extensively on tensor computations such as quantum many-body simulations in chemistry and physics (material science and electronic structure calculations), as well as developers and experts of tensor software who have the know-how to provide the technical support for such applications. The workshop enabled the community to provide feedback on the specified low-level interface and how it can be further refined. It also initiated a discussion on how the standardization efforts should be oriented in the near feature, in particular on what should be higher-level interfaces and how to tackle other requirements of the community such as tensor decompositions, symmetric tensors and structured sparsity support.",

      "abstract": "Phishing sites continue to grow in volume and sophistication. Recent work leverages large language models (LLMs) to analyze URLs, HTML, and rendered content to decide whether a website is a phishing site. While these approaches are promising, LLMs are inherently vulnerable to prompt injection (PI). Because attackers can fully control various elements of phishing sites, this creates the potential for PI that exploits the perceptual asymmetry between LLMs and humans: instructions imperceptible to end users can still be parsed by the LLM and can stealthily manipulate its judgment. The specific risks of PI in phishing detection and effective mitigation strategies remain largely unexplored. This paper presents the first comprehensive evaluation of PI against multimodal LLM-based phishing detection. We introduce a two-dimensional taxonomy, defined by Attack Techniques and Attack Surfaces, that captures realistic PI strategies. Using this taxonomy, we implement diverse attacks and empirically study several representative LLM-based detection systems. The results show that phishing detection with state-of-the-art models such as GPT-5 remains vulnerable to PI. We then propose InjectDefuser, a defense framework that combines prompt hardening, allowlist-based retrieval augmentation, and output validation. Across multiple models, InjectDefuser significantly reduces attack success rates. Our findings clarify the PI risk landscape and offer practical defenses that improve the reliability of next-generation phishing countermeasures.",

The modification of these formulas due to the helicity-rotation coupling are discussed. In connection with the aberration of polarized radiation, we note that the helicity of radiation incident on a rotating observer couples to its angular velocity of rotation resulting in a slight helicity-dependent modification of the standard aberration formula. We discuss the physical origin of this effect and estimate the magnitude of the helicity aberration.",

      "abstract": "Drug discovery remains time-consuming, labor-intensive, and expensive, often requiring years and substantial investment per drug candidate. Predicting compound-protein interactions (CPIs) is a critical component in this process, enabling the identification of molecular interactions between drug candidates and target proteins. Recent deep learning methods have successfully modeled CPIs at the atomic level, achieving improved efficiency and accuracy over traditional energy-based approaches. However, these models do not always align with chemical realities, as molecular fragments (motifs or functional groups) typically serve as the primary units of biological recognition and binding. In this paper, we propose Phi-former, a pairwise hierarchical interaction representation learning method that addresses this gap by incorporating the biological role of motifs in CPIs. Phi-former represents compounds and proteins hierarchically and employs a pairwise pre-training framework to model interactions systematically across atom-atom, motif-motif, and atom-motif levels, reflecting how biological systems recognize molecular partners. We design intra-level and inter-level learning pipelines that make different interaction levels mutually beneficial. Experimental results demonstrate that Phi-former achieves superior performance on CPI-related tasks. A case study shows that our method accurately identifies specific atoms or motifs activated in CPIs, providing interpretable model explanations. These insights may guide rational drug design and support precision medicine applications.",

The nonextensive parameter $q$ accounts for the deviation from equilibrium and provides a more realistic description of the medium that is not perfectly thermalized. The hadronic bath, consisting of various mesonic and baryonic species, is characterized by different mass cutoffs that control the spectral composition of the medium. Our analysis shows that both the drag $F$ and momentum diffusion coefficients $Γ$ increases exponentially with temperature and increases systematically with increasing $q$ and mass cutoff. The spatial diffusion coefficient $D_x$ exhibits a decreasing trend with temperature $T$, $q$ and mass cutoff which highlights the significant influence of nonequilibrium effects and hadronic composition on the transport behaviour of hadrons, offering valuable insights into the thermal and dynamical properties of the hadronic phase preceding freezeout in heavy ion collisions. Additionally, we have studied the relaxation time of heavy mesons such as $D_0$, $J/ψ$ and $Υ$. We found that the heavier mesons relaxed later in comparison to the lighter mesons in the hadronic medium.",

This allows us to construct a complete spatiotemporal topological phase diagram in a unified parameter space. By mapping this phase diagram onto a spatially graded PC, we experimentally observe multiple Bloch momentum-band gaps and a continuous spatiotemporal topological transition via translating across the static sample, enabling real-time control over the evolution pathway of the band topology.

      "abstract": "The quest for expert-level reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs) has been hampered by a persistent \\textit{reward bottleneck}: traditional reinforcement learning (RL) relies on scalar rewards that are \\textbf{costly} to scale, \\textbf{brittle} across domains, and \\textbf{blind} to the underlying logic of a solution. This reliance on external, impoverished signals prevents models from developing a deep, self-contained understanding of reasoning principles. We introduce \\textbf{ALIVE} (\\emph{Adversarial Learning with Instructive Verbal Evaluation}), a hands-free alignment framework that moves beyond scalar reward optimization toward intrinsic reasoning acquisition. Grounded in the principle of \\emph{Cognitive Synergy}, ALIVE unifies problem posing, solving, and judging within a single policy model to internalize the logic of correctness. By coupling adversarial learning with instructive verbal feedback, ALIVE enables models to internalize evaluative criteria directly from raw corpora, effectively transforming external critiques into an endogenous reasoning faculty. Empirical evaluations across mathematical reasoning, code generation, and general logical inference benchmarks demonstrate that ALIVE consistently mitigates reward signal limitations. With identical data and compute, it achieves accuracy gains, markedly improved cross-domain generalization, and higher self-correction rates. These results indicate that the reasoning trinity fosters a self-sustaining trajectory of capability growth, positioning ALIVE as a scalable foundation for general-purpose reasoning alignment without human-in-the-loop supervision.",

      "abstract": "Characterizing the ground-state properties of disordered systems, such as spin glasses and combinatorial optimization problems, is fundamental to science and engineering. However, computing exact ground states and counting their degeneracies are generally NP-hard and #P-hard problems, respectively, posing a formidable challenge for exact algorithms. Recently, Tensor Networks methods, which utilize high-dimensional linear algebra and achieve massive hardware parallelization, have emerged as a rapidly developing paradigm for efficiently solving these tasks. Despite their success, these methods are fundamentally constrained by the exponential growth of space complexity, which severely limits their scalability. To address this bottleneck, we introduce the Branch-and-Bound Tensor Network (BBTN) method, which seamlessly integrates the adaptive search framework of branch-and-bound with the efficient contraction of tropical tensor networks, significantly extending the reach of exact algorithms. We show that BBTN significantly surpasses existing state-of-the-art solvers, setting new benchmarks for exact computation. It pushes the boundaries of tractability to previously unreachable scales, enabling exact ground-state counting for $\\pm J$ spin glasses up to $64 \\times 64$ and solving Maximum Independent Set problems on King's subgraphs up to $100 \\times 100$. For hard instances, BBTN dramatically reduces the computational cost of standard Tropical Tensor Networks, compressing years of runtime into minutes. Furthermore, it outperforms leading integer-programming solvers by over 30$\\times$, establishing a versatile and scalable framework for solving hard problems in statistical physics and combinatorial optimization.",

      "title": "TaSA: Two-Phased Deep Predictive Learning of Tactile Sensory Attenuation for Improving In-Grasp Manipulation",
      "abstract": "Humans can achieve diverse in-hand manipulations, such as object pinching and tool use, which often involve simultaneous contact between the object and multiple fingers. This is still an open issue for robotic hands because such dexterous manipulation requires distinguishing between tactile sensations generated by their self-contact and those arising from external contact. Otherwise, object/robot breakage happens due to contacts/collisions. Indeed, most approaches ignore self-contact altogether, by constraining motion to avoid/ignore self-tactile information during contact. While this reduces complexity, it also limits generalization to real-world scenarios where self-contact is inevitable. Humans overcome this challenge through self-touch perception, using predictive mechanisms that anticipate the tactile consequences of their own motion, through a principle called sensory attenuation, where the nervous system differentiates predictable self-touch signals, allowing novel object stimuli to stand out as relevant. Deriving from this, we introduce TaSA, a two-phased deep predictive learning framework. In the first phase, TaSA explicitly learns self-touch dynamics, modeling how a robot's own actions generate tactile feedback. In the second phase, this learned model is incorporated into the motion learning phase, to emphasize object contact signals during manipulation. We evaluate TaSA on a set of insertion tasks, which demand fine tactile discrimination: inserting a pencil lead into a mechanical pencil, inserting coins into a slot, and fixing a paper clip onto a sheet of paper, with various orientations, positions, and sizes. Across all tasks, policies trained with TaSA achieve significantly higher success rates than baseline methods, demonstrating that structured tactile perception with self-touch based on sensory attenuation is critical for dexterous robotic manipulation.",

Recent studies project universal features onto the conditional feature subspace spanned by an LLM-generated text basis to obtain conditional representations. However, such methods face two key limitations: sensitivity to subspace basis and vulnerability to inter-subspace interference. To address these challenges, we propose OD-CRL, a novel framework integrating Adaptive Orthogonal Basis Optimization (AOBO) and Null-Space Denoising Projection (NSDP). Specifically, AOBO constructs orthogonal semantic bases via singular value decomposition with a curvature-based truncation. NSDP suppresses non-target semantic interference by projecting embeddings onto the null space of irrelevant subspaces.

      "abstract": "Modern AI systems achieve remarkable capabilities at the cost of substantial energy consumption. To connect intelligence to physical efficiency, we propose two complementary bits-per-joule metrics under explicit accounting conventions: (1) Thermodynamic Epiplexity per Joule -- bits of structural information about a theoretical environment-instance variable newly encoded in an agent's internal state per unit measured energy within a stated boundary -- and (2) Empowerment per Joule -- the embodied sensorimotor channel capacity (control information) per expected energetic cost over a fixed horizon. These provide two axes of physical intelligence: recognition (model-building) vs.control (action influence). Drawing on stochastic thermodynamics, we show how a Landauer-scale closed-cycle benchmark for epiplexity acquisition follows as a corollary of a standard thermodynamic-learning inequality under explicit subsystem assumptions, and we clarify how Landauer-scaled costs act as closed-cycle benchmarks under explicit reset/reuse and boundary-closure assumptions; conversely, we give a simple decoupling construction showing that without such assumptions -- and without charging for externally prepared low-entropy resources (e.g.fresh memory) crossing the boundary -- information gain and in-boundary dissipation need not be tightly linked. For empirical settings where the latent structure variable is unavailable, we align the operational notion of epiplexity with compute-bounded MDL epiplexity and recommend reporting MDL-epiplexity / compression-gain surrogates as companions. Finally, we propose a unified efficiency framework that reports both metrics together with a minimal checklist of boundary/energy accounting, coarse-graining/noise, horizon/reset, and cost conventions to reduce ambiguity and support consistent bits-per-joule comparisons, and we sketch connections to energy-adjusted scaling analyses.",

This thesis investigates the renormalisation structure of SMEFT, focusing on dimension-eight operators, which are increasingly relevant in precision analyses and in models where dimension-six effects are suppressed.   We review renormalisation in quantum field theory, emphasising dimensional regularisation and the $\\overline{\\text{MS}}$ scheme, and outline the conceptual foundations of EFTs. One of the central results of this work is the systematic construction and classification of bosonic operators in SMEFT at dimension eight, employing Group Theory techniques and removing redundancies by working in momentum space. Building on this operator basis, we compute the complete one-loop renormalisation group equations (RGEs) involving insertions of dimension-eight-or-lower operators. This includes pure dimension-eight effects, pairs of dimension-six operators and lepton-number-violating sectors. Our calculations use an off-shell Green's function basis and leverage algebraic simplifications derived from symmetry and gauge invariance.   These results are applied to positivity bounds and oblique parameters, providing essential tools for consistent SMEFT analyses across energy scales. The findings extend SMEFT's theoretical reach and support its use in high-precision phenomenology.",

      "abstract": "Hyperparameter sensitivity in Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) is often accepted as unavoidable. However, it remains unclear whether it is intrinsic to the RL problem or exacerbated by specific training mechanisms. We investigate this question in offline goal-conditioned RL, where data distributions are fixed, and non-stationarity can be explicitly controlled via scheduled shifts in data quality. Additionally, we study varying data qualities under both stationary and non-stationary regimes, and cover two representative algorithms: HIQL (bootstrapped TD-learning) and QRL (quasimetric representation learning). Overall, we observe substantially greater robustness to changes in hyperparameter configurations than commonly reported for online RL, even under controlled non-stationarity. Once modest expert data is present ($\\approx$ 20\\%), QRL maintains broad, stable near-optimal regions, while HIQL exhibits sharp optima that drift significantly across training phases. To explain this divergence, we introduce an inter-goal gradient alignment diagnostic. We find that bootstrapped objectives exhibit stronger destructive gradient interference, which coincides directly with hyperparameter sensitivity. These results suggest that high sensitivity to changes in hyperparameter configurations during training is not inevitable in RL, but is amplified by the dynamics of bootstrapping, offering a pathway toward more robust algorithmic objective design.",

Existing LLM-based ER approaches operate either in unsupervised settings and rely on very large and costly models, or in supervised settings and require ground-truth annotations, leaving a critical gap between time efficiency and effectiveness. To make LLM-powered ER more practical, we investigate Knowledge Distillation (KD) as a means to transfer knowledge from large, effective models (Teachers) to smaller, more efficient models (Students) without requiring gold labels. We introduce DistillER, the first framework that systematically bridges this gap across three dimensions: (i) Data Selection, where we study strategies for identifying informative subsets of data; (ii) Knowledge Elicitation, where we compare single- and multi-teacher settings across LLMs and smaller language models (SLMs); and (iii) Distillation Algorithms, where we evaluate supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning approaches. Our experiments reveal that supervised fine-tuning of Students on noisy labels generated by LLM Teachers consistently outperforms alternative KD strategies, while also enabling high-quality explanation generation. Finally, we benchmark DistillER against established supervised and unsupervised ER methods based on LLMs and SLMs, demonstrating significant improvements in both effectiveness and efficiency.",

It is thanks to recent advances in approximate nearest neighbor search-with the emergence of highly efficient algorithms such as the inverted index-based Seismic and the graph-based Hnsw-that retrieval with sparse representations became viable in practice. In this work, we scrutinize the efficiency of sparse retrieval algorithms and focus particularly on the size of a data structure that is common to all algorithmic flavors and that constitutes a substantial fraction of the overall index size: the forward index. In particular, we seek compression techniques to reduce the storage footprint of the forward index without compromising search quality or inner product computation latency. In our examination with various integer compression techniques, we report that StreamVByte achieves the best trade-off between memory footprint, retrieval accuracy, and latency. We then improve StreamVByte by introducing DotVByte, a new algorithm tailored to inner product computation. Experiments on MsMarco show that our improvements lead to significant space savings while maintaining retrieval efficiency.",

The argument is based on a boundary iteration scheme: an initial Hölder modulus for the boundary trace (coming from quasiconformality) is improved via the $C^{1,α}$ graph representation of $\\partialΩ$, yielding higher Hölder regularity for the normal component. This boundary gain is converted into a near-boundary gradient bound for harmonic functions through a basepoint boundary Hölder-to-gradient estimate obtained by flattening the boundary and using local harmonic-measure bounds. Quasiconformality then propagates the resulting control from one component to the full differential, and iteration gives boundedness of $|Df|$ up to the boundary. Along the way we briefly survey several standard tools from the theory of quasiconformal harmonic mappings (QCH), including boundary Hölder continuity, distortion of derivatives, and boundary-to-interior propagation principles that enter the iteration.",

This paper introduces a flexible Koopman autoencoder formulation that incorporates meteorological forcings and boundary conditions, and systematically compares its performance against POD-based surrogates. The Koopman autoencoder employs a learned linear temporal operator in latent space, enabling eigenvalue regularization to promote temporal stability. This strategy is evaluated alongside temporal unrolling techniques for achieving stable and accurate long-term predictions. The models are assessed on three test cases spanning distinct dynamical regimes, with prediction horizons up to one year at 30-minute temporal resolution. Across all cases, the Koopman autoencoder with temporal unrolling yields the best overall accuracy compared to the POD-based surrogates, achieving relative root-mean-squared-errors of 0.01-0.13 and $R^2$-values of 0.65-0.996. Prediction errors are largest for current velocities, and smallest for water surface elevations. Comparing to in-situ observations, the surrogate yields -0.65% to 12% change in water surface elevation prediction error when compared to prediction errors of the physics-based model. These error levels, corresponding to a few centimeters, are acceptable for many practical applications, while inference speed-ups of 300-1400x enables workflows such as ensemble forecasting and long climate simulations for coastal-ocean modelling.",

      "abstract": "Realizing the 6G vision of artificial intelligence (AI) and integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) critically requires large-scale real-world channel datasets for channel modeling and data-driven AI models. However, traditional frequency-domain channel sounding methods suffer from low efficiency due to a prohibitive number of frequency points to avoid delay ambiguity. This paper proposes a novel channel sounding framework involving sparse nonuniform sampling along with a likelihood-rectified space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (LR-SAGE) algorithm for multipath component extraction. This framework enables the acquisition of channel datasets that are tens or even hundreds of times larger within the same channel measurement duration, thereby providing the massive data required to harness the full potential of AI scaling laws. Specifically, we propose a Parabolic Frequency Sampling (PFS) strategy that non-uniformly distributes frequency points, effectively eliminating delay ambiguity while reducing sampling overhead by orders of magnitude. To efficiently extract multipath components (MPCs) from the channel data measured by PFS, we develop a LR-SAGE algorithm, rectifying the likelihood distortion caused by nonuniform sampling and molecular absorption effect. Simulation results and experimental validation at 280--300~GHz confirm that the proposed PFS and LR-SAGE algorithm not only achieve 50$\\times$ faster measurement, a 98\\% reduction in data volume and a 99.96\\% reduction in post-processing computational complexity, but also successfully captures MPCs and channel characteristics consistent with traditional exhaustive measurements, demonstrating its potential as a fundamental enabler for constructing the massive ISAC datasets required by AI-native 6G systems.",

      "abstract": "We present a comprehensive temporal and spectral analysis of the long-duration gamma-ray burst GRB 110801A, utilizing multi-band data from the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory and ground-based telescopes. The $γ$-ray emission exhibits a distinct two-episode (``double-burst'') structure. Rapid follow-up observations in the optical and X-ray bands provide full coverage of the second burst. The optical light curve begins to rise approximately 135 s after the trigger, significantly preceding the second emission episode observed in X-rays and $γ$-rays at $\\sim 320$ s. This chromatic behavior suggests different physical origins for the optical and high-energy emissions. Joint broadband spectral fitting (optical to $γ$-rays) during the second episode reveals that a two-component model, consisting of a power-law plus a Band function, provides a superior fit compared to single-component models. We interpret the power-law component as the afterglow of the first burst (dominating the optical band), while the Band component is attributed to the prompt emission of the second burst (dominating the high-energy bands). A physical synchrotron model is also found to be a viable candidate to explain the high-energy emission. Regarding the afterglow, the early optical light curve displays a sharp transition from a rise of $\\sim t^{2.5}$ to $\\sim t^{6.5}$, which is well-explained by a scenario involving both reverse shock (RS) and forward shock (FS) components. We constrain the key physical parameters of the burst, deriving an initial Lorentz factor $Γ_0 \\sim 60$, a jet half-opening angle $θ_j \\sim 0.09$, and an isotropic kinetic energy $E_{\\rm k,iso} \\sim 10^{54.8}$ erg.",

      "abstract": "Advanced opinion dynamics modeling is vital for deciphering social behavior, emphasizing its role in mitigating polarization and securing cyberspace. To synergize mechanistic interpretability with data-driven flexibility, recent studies have explored the integration of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for opinion modeling. Despite this promise, existing methods are tailored to incomplete priors, lacking a comprehensive physical system to integrate dynamics from local, global, and endogenous levels. Moreover, penalty-based constraints adopted in existing methods struggle to deeply encode physical priors, leading to optimization pathologies and discrepancy between latent representations and physical transparency. To this end, we offer a physical view to interpret opinion dynamics via Diffusion-Convection-Reaction (DCR) system inspired by interacting particle theory. Building upon the Neural ODEs, we define the neural opinion dynamics to coordinate neural networks with physical priors, and further present the OPINN, a physics-informed neural framework for opinion dynamics modeling. Evaluated on real-world and synthetic datasets, OPINN achieves state-of-the-art performance in opinion evolution forecasting, offering a promising paradigm for the nexus of cyber, physical, and social systems.",

      "abstract": "Document parsing has garnered widespread attention as vision-language models (VLMs) advance OCR capabilities. However, the field remains fragmented across dozens of specialized models with varying strengths, forcing users to navigate complex model selection and limiting system scalability. Moreover, existing two-stage approaches depend on axis-aligned bounding boxes for layout detection, failing to handle distorted or photographed documents effectively. To this end, we present Dolphin-v2, a two-stage document image parsing model that substantially improves upon the original Dolphin. In the first stage, Dolphin-v2 jointly performs document type classification (digital-born versus photographed) alongside layout analysis. For digital-born documents, it conducts finer-grained element detection with reading order prediction. In the second stage, we employ a hybrid parsing strategy: photographed documents are parsed holistically as complete pages to handle geometric distortions, while digital-born documents undergo element-wise parallel parsing guided by the detected layout anchors, enabling efficient content extraction. Compared with the original Dolphin, Dolphin-v2 introduces several crucial enhancements: (1) robust parsing of photographed documents via holistic page-level understanding, (2) finer-grained element detection (21 categories) with semantic attribute extraction such as author information and document metadata, and (3) code block recognition with indentation preservation, which existing systems typically lack. Comprehensive evaluations are conducted on DocPTBench, OmniDocBench, and our self-constructed RealDoc-160 benchmark. The results demonstrate substantial improvements: +14.78 points overall on the challenging OmniDocBench and 91% error reduction on photographed documents, while maintaining efficient inference through parallel processing.",

      "abstract": "Effective reinforcement learning (RL) for complex stochastic systems requires leveraging historical data collected in previous iterations to accelerate policy optimization. Classical experience replay treats all past observations uniformly and fails to account for their varying contributions to learning. To overcome this limitation, we propose Variance Reduction Experience Replay (VRER), a principled framework that selectively reuses informative samples to reduce variance in policy gradient estimation. VRER is algorithm-agnostic and integrates seamlessly with existing policy optimization methods, forming the basis of our sample-efficient off-policy algorithm, Policy Gradient with VRER (PG-VRER). Motivated by the lack of rigorous theoretical analysis of experience replay, we develop a novel framework that explicitly captures dependencies introduced by Markovian dynamics and behavior-policy interactions. Using this framework, we establish finite-time convergence guarantees for PG-VRER and reveal a fundamental bias-variance trade-off: reusing older experience increases bias but simultaneously reduces gradient variance. Extensive empirical experiments demonstrate that VRER consistently accelerates policy learning and improves performance over state-of-the-art policy optimization algorithms.",

      "abstract": "Researchers have widely used accelerated life tests to determine an optimal inspection plan for lot acceptance. All such plans are proposed by assuming a known relationship between the lifetime characteristic(s) and the accelerating stress factor(s) under a parametric framework of the product lifetime distribution. As the true relationship is rarely known in practical scenarios, the assumption itself may produce biased estimates that may lead to an inefficient sampling plan. To this endeavor, an optimal accelerating life test plan is designed under a Type-I censoring scheme with a generalized link structure similar to a spline regression, to capture the nonlinear relationship between the lifetime characteristics and the stress levels. Product lifetime is assumed to follow Weibull distribution with non-identical scale and shape parameters linked with the stress factor through a piecewise linear function. The elements of the Fisher information matrix are computed in detail to formulate the acceptability criterion for the conforming lots. The decision variables of the sampling plan including sample size, stress factors, and others are determined using a constrained aggregated cost minimization approach and variance minimization approach. A simulated case study demonstrates that the nonlinear link-based piecewise linear approximation model outperforms the linear link-based model.",

We utilize the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) for effective decomposition and apply the PWA technique to handle the nonlinear components. To solve the resulting large-scale nonconvex problems, the paper introduces a convex ADMM algorithm that transforms the nonconvex problem into a series of smaller convex problems, significantly enhancing computational efficiency. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the convex ADMM algorithm converges to a local optimum of the original problem. A case study involving 36 zones validates the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our proposed method reduces execution time by 86\\% compared to the centralized version.",

The resulting alternating fitting procedure is exactly equivalent to a damped Newton (Gauss-Newton) method within fixed partitions. We analyze this node-level optimization and, for a backtracking line-search variant, prove that the local objective decreases monotonically and converges; in practice, both fixed and adaptive damping yield fast, stable convergence and can be combined with optional ridge regularization. We further prove that HRT's model class is a universal approximator with an explicit $O(δ^2)$ approximation rate, and show on synthetic and real-world benchmarks that it matches or outperforms single-tree baselines with more compact structures.",

In this work, we introduce CityGenAgent, a natural language-driven framework for hierarchical procedural generation of high-quality 3D cities. Our approach decomposes city generation into two interpretable components, Block Program and Building Program. To ensure structural correctness and semantic alignment, we adopt a two-stage learning strategy: (1) Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). We train BlockGen and BuildingGen to generate valid programs that adhere to schema constraints, including non-self-intersecting polygons and complete fields; (2) Reinforcement Learning (RL). We design Spatial Alignment Reward to enhance spatial reasoning ability and Visual Consistency Reward to bridge the gap between textual descriptions and the visual modality. Benefiting from the programs and the models' generalization, CityGenAgent supports natural language editing and manipulation. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate superior semantic alignment, visual quality, and controllability compared to existing methods, establishing a robust foundation for scalable 3D city generation.",

Agents frequently hallucinate investigative reasoning by claiming to rely on evidence they never accessed. Even when correct context is discovered, agents often fail to integrate it into their final decision. Providing more explicit instructions improves context discovery but often reduces overall accuracy, revealing a tradeoff between procedural compliance and effective judgement.

      "abstract": "Modern neural networks have shown promise for solving partial differential equations over surfaces, often by discretizing the surface as a mesh and learning with a mesh-aware graph neural network. However, graph neural networks suffer from oversmoothing, where a node's features become increasingly similar to those of its neighbors. Unitary graph convolutions, which are mathematically constrained to preserve smoothness, have been proposed to address this issue. Despite this, in many physical systems, such as diffusion processes, smoothness naturally increases and unitarity may be overconstraining. In this paper, we systematically study the smoothing effects of different GNNs for dynamics modeling and prove that unitary convolutions hurt performance for such tasks. We propose relaxed unitary convolutions that balance smoothness preservation with the natural smoothing required for physical systems. We also generalize unitary and relaxed unitary convolutions from graphs to meshes. In experiments on PDEs such as the heat and wave equations over complex meshes and on weather forecasting, we find that our method outperforms several strong baselines, including mesh-aware transformers and equivariant neural networks.",

Specifically, this method multiplies the expected improvement (EI) by a weight encoding prior crystal growth physics. When applied to LaAlO3 molecular-beam epitaxy, the weighting function defines a flat stoichiometric window and penalizes off-window proposals, thereby steering the optimization toward physically plausible regions while maintaining controlled exploration. In a closed-loop optimization, relative to the bare EI, which often proposes off-stoichiometric conditions, the weighted EI constrains the search toward stoichiometric regions while retaining sufficient flexibility to explore neighboring conditions, eventually identifying an optimum slightly beyond the stoichiometric window. Within only 15 growth runs, the lattice constant of the grown LaAlO3 film converged to the bulk value, evidencing efficient and rapid optimization for the ideal stoichiometric growth. Because physics knowledge is incorporated solely through the weighting function, the approach requires only minimal modification to standard BO workflows and is readily applicable to other material systems, offering a general and practical route to AI-driven materials synthesis.",

Specifically, we identify two fundamental flaws that universally constrain these methods: the Static Homogeneity Assumption (fixed representational resources for all classes) and the Learning-Inference Disconnect (discarding rich prototype quality knowledge at inference). These flaws fundamentally limit the model's capacity and performance. To address these issues, we propose APEX (Adaptive Prototype for eXtensive OOD Detection), a novel OOD detection framework designed via a Two-Stage Repair process to optimize the learned feature manifold. APEX introduces two key innovations to address these respective flaws: (1) an Adaptive Prototype Manifold (APM), which leverages the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle to automatically determine the optimal prototype complexity $K_c^*$ for each class, thereby fundamentally resolving prototype collision; and (2) a Posterior-Aware OOD Scoring (PAOS) mechanism, which quantifies prototype quality (cohesion and separation) to bridge the learning-inference disconnect.

Here we present an end-to-end differentiable workflow to optimize a single deep-learned energy functional using targets from both Kohn-Sham DFT and adiabatic LR-TDDFT within the Tamm-Dancoff approximation. Implemented in a JAX-based two-component quantum chemistry code (IQC), the learned functional yields a consistent potential and LR kernel via automatic differentiation, enabling gradient-based training through the SCF fixed point and the Casida equation. As a proof of concept in a fixed finite basis (cc-pVDZ), we learn an exchange-correlation functional on the helium spectrum while incorporating one-electron self-interaction cancelation and the Lieb-Oxford inequality as penalty terms, and we assess its possible transfer to molecular test cases.",

      "abstract": "Wi-Fi sensing has attracted significant attention for human sensing and related applications. However, unsynchronized transmitters and receivers fundamentally preclude phase-coherent radar-like delay--Doppler analysis. By exploiting the line-of-sight (LoS) path, i.e., the earliest-arriving direct path, as an over-the-air (OTA) reference for delay and phase, we propose an OTA LoS-path referencing scheme, termed LoSRef, that enables delay calibration and phase alignment in unsynchronized Wi-Fi systems. Unlike conventional Wi-Fi bistatic radar systems that rely on wired reference signals or dedicated reference antennas, the proposed LoSRef-based framework bridges the long-standing gap between conventional Wi-Fi sensing and Wi-Fi radar, enabling phase-coherent bistatic radar-like operation in a drop-in Wi-Fi sensing configuration. Through human gait and respiration experiments in indoor environments, we demonstrate that phase-coherent channel impulse responses and corresponding delay--Doppler responses are obtained using only commodity Wi-Fi devices. This enables physically interpretable human motion sensing, including gait-induced range variation and respiration-induced sub-wavelength displacement, as well as the extraction of target-induced dynamics up to 20 dB weaker than dominant static multipath components.",

A perception survey supports this scaled boxwidth choice. For a large number of groups, we propose circular quartile plots. A three-dimensional toroidal display is also implemented for periodic angular distributions. We illustrate our methods on datasets in (1) psychology, to display motor resonance under different conditions, (2) genomics, to understand the distribution of peak phases for ancillary clock genes, and (3) meteorology and wind turbine power generation, to study the changing and periodic distribution of wind direction over the course of a year.",

      "abstract": "Cyber attacks have become a serious threat to the security of software systems. Many organizations have built their security knowledge bases to safeguard against attacks and vulnerabilities. However, due to the time lag in the official release of security information, these security knowledge bases may not be well maintained, and using them to protect software systems against emergent security risks can be challenging. On the other hand, the security posts on online knowledge-sharing platforms contain many crowd security discussions and the knowledge in those posts can be used to enhance the security knowledge bases. This paper proposes SynAT, an automatic approach to synthesize attack trees from crowd security posts. Given a security post, SynAT first utilize the Large Language Model (LLM) and prompt learning to restrict the scope of sentences that may contain attack information; then it utilizes a transition-based event and relation extraction model to extract the events and relations simultaneously from the scope; finally, it applies heuristic rules to synthesize the attack trees with the extracted events and relations. An experimental evaluation is conducted on 5,070 Stack Overflow security posts, and the results show that SynAT outperforms all baselines in both event and relation extraction, and achieves the highest tree similarity in attack tree synthesis. Furthermore, SynAT has been applied to enhance HUAWEI's security knowledge base as well as public security knowledge bases CVE and CAPEC, which demonstrates SynAT's practicality.",

The free boundaries $x=g(t)$ and $x=h(t)$ evolve subject to a ``preferred population density\" condition at the habitat edges. Analogous to the traveling wave solutions in the corresponding Cauchy problem, semi-wave solutions play a fundamental role in understanding the propagation phenomena governed by the free boundary problem here. But in contrast to the Cauchy problem, where the KPP condition plays a subtle role in the precise approximation of its solution (with compactly supported initial function) by the traveling wave solution with minimal speed, here we prove the existence and uniqueness of a semi-wave in a general monostable setting, and obtain a precise description of the convergence of the solution toward the semi-wave as time goes to infinity, where the KPP condition plays no special role. Previously, such a sharp result was proved for a free boundary model only when $f$ is autonomous ($f=f(u)$, see \\cite{D} or \\cite{DL15} for a related free boundary model), or a less precise result was obtained in the time-periodic case under an extra strong KPP condition on $f$ (see \\cite{MDW}, or \\cite{DGP} for a related free boundary model). This work appears to be the first to prove the sharp convergence result for a general monostable free boundary problem in a heterogeneous environment, and we believe the methods developed here should have applications to related free boundary problems in heterogeneous media with nonlinearities more general than those of KPP type.",

      "abstract": "Offline Safe Reinforcement Learning (OSRL) aims to learn a policy to achieve high performance in sequential decision-making while satisfying constraints, using only pre-collected datasets. Recent works, inspired by the strong capabilities of Generative Models (GMs), reformulate decision-making in OSRL as a conditional generative process, where GMs generate desirable actions conditioned on predefined reward and cost values. However, GM-assisted methods face two major challenges in OSRL: (1) lacking the ability to \"stitch\" optimal transitions from suboptimal trajectories within the dataset, and (2) struggling to balance reward targets with cost targets, particularly when they are conflict. To address these issues, we propose Goal-Assisted Stitching (GAS), a novel algorithm designed to enhance stitching capabilities while effectively balancing reward maximization and constraint satisfaction. To enhance the stitching ability, GAS first augments and relabels the dataset at the transition level, enabling the construction of high-quality trajectories from suboptimal ones. GAS also introduces novel goal functions, which estimate the optimal achievable reward and cost goals from the dataset. These goal functions, trained using expectile regression on the relabeled and augmented dataset, allow GAS to accommodate a broader range of reward-cost return pairs and achieve a better tradeoff between reward maximization and constraint satisfaction compared to human-specified values. The estimated goals then guide policy training, ensuring robust performance under constrained settings. Furthermore, to improve training stability and efficiency, we reshape the dataset to achieve a more uniform reward-cost return distribution. Empirical results validate the effectiveness of GAS, demonstrating superior performance in balancing reward maximization and constraint satisfaction compared to existing methods.",

Column density maps are derived from 870 $μ$m dust continuum emission, and the Histogram of Relative Orientations (HRO) method is applied to quantify the correlation between magnetic field orientations and density structures on envelope scales ($\\sim$10$^{3}$~au). We find that the relative alignment shows overall weak evidence of systematic evolution with column density, suggesting that column density alone does not fully determine the alignment. The magnetization level also plays a crucial role, with weakly magnetized envelopes exhibiting predominantly parallel or random alignment, whereas strongly magnetized ones show perpendicular configurations even at moderate densities. These results reveal that density and magnetization jointly shape the morphology of protostellar envelopes and the coupling between gravity and magnetic fields during early stages of star formation.",

While modern data-driven machine learning techniques have proven highly effective in establishing structure-property correlations, many models are criticized for lacking physical interpretability and being task-specific. In this work, we identify an approximate linear relation between structure profiles and disorder-induced responses of glass properties based on first order perturbation theory. We analytically demonstrate that this relationship holds universally across glassy systems with varying dimensions and distinct interaction types. This robust theoretical relationship motivates the adoption of linear machine learning models, which we show numerically to achieve surprisingly high predictive accuracy for structure-property mapping in a wide variety of glassy materials. We further devise regularization analysis to further enhance the interpretability of our model, bridging the gap between predictive performance and physical insight. Overall, this linear relation establishes a simple yet powerful connection between structural disorder and spectral properties in glasses, opening a new avenue for advancing their studies.",

In recent years, the fuzzing process has been integrated into continuous integration workflows (i.e., continuous fuzzing), enabling short and frequent testing cycles. Despite its widespread adoption, prior research has not examined whether the effectiveness of continuous fuzzing varies across programming languages. This study conducts a large-scale cross-language analysis to examine how fuzzing bug characteristics and detection efficiency differ among languages. We analyze 61,444 fuzzing bugs and 999,248 builds from 559 OSS-Fuzz projects categorized by primary language. Our findings reveal that (i) C++ and Rust exhibit higher fuzzing bug detection frequencies, (ii) Rust and Python show low vulnerability ratios but tend to expose more critical vulnerabilities, (iii) crash types vary across languages and unreproducible bugs are more frequent in Go but rare in Rust, and (iv) Python attains higher patch coverage but suffers from longer time-to-detection. These results demonstrate that fuzzing behavior and effectiveness are strongly shaped by language design, providing insights for language-aware fuzzing strategies and tool development.",

However, existing methods offer guarantees only under fixed ideal unperturbed dynamics, limiting their reliability in real-world applications where dynamics may deviate due to uncertainties. In this work, we study the problem of synthesizing \\emph{robust neural Lyapunov barrier certificates} that maintain their guarantees under perturbations in system dynamics. We formally define a robust Lyapunov barrier function and specify sufficient conditions based on Lipschitz continuity that ensure robustness against bounded perturbations. We propose practical training objectives that enforce these conditions via adversarial training, Lipschitz neighborhood bound, and global Lipschitz regularization. We validate our approach in two practically relevant environments, Inverted Pendulum and 2D Docking. The former is a widely studied benchmark, while the latter is a safety-critical task in autonomous systems. We show that our methods significantly improve both certified robustness bounds (up to $4.6$ times) and empirical success rates under strong perturbations (up to $2.4$ times) compared to the baseline. Our results demonstrate effectiveness of training robust neural certificates for safe RL under perturbations in dynamics.",

      "abstract": "Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) has emerged as a prominent tool for imaging internal defects in cylindrical structures, such as columns, utility poles, and tree trunks. However, accurately reconstructing both the shape and permittivity of the defects inside cylindrical structures remains challenging due to complex wave scattering phenomena and the limited accuracy of the existing signal processing and deep learning techniques. To address these issues, this study proposes a migration-assisted deep learning scheme for reconstructing the shape and permittivity of defects within cylindrical structures. The proposed scheme involves three stages of GPR data processing. First, a dual-permittivity estimation network extracts the permittivity values of the defect and the cylindrical structure, the latter of which is estimated with the help of a novel structural similarity index measure-based autofocusing technique. Second, a modified Kirchhoff migration incorporating the extracted permittivity of the cylindrical structure maps the signals reflected from the defect to the imaging domain. Third, a shape reconstruction network processes the migrated image to recover the precise shape of the defect. The image of the interior defect is finally obtained by combining the reconstructed shape and extracted permittivity of the defect. The proposed scheme is validated using both synthetic and experimental data from a laboratory trunk model and real tree trunk samples. Comparative results show superior performance over existing deep learning methods, while generalization tests on live trees confirm its feasibility for in-field deployment. The underlying principle can further be applied to other circumferential GPR imaging scenarios. The code and database are available at: https://github.com/jwqian54/Migration-Assisted-DL.",

      "abstract": "We present an end-to-end framework for generating solutions to combinatorial optimization problems with unknown components using transformer-based sequence-to-sequence neural networks. Our framework learns directly from past solutions and incorporates the known components, such as hard constraints, via a constraint reasoning module, yielding a constrained learning scheme. The trained model generates new solutions that are structurally similar to past solutions and are guaranteed to respect the known constraints. We apply our approach to three combinatorial optimization problems with unknown components: the knapsack problem with an unknown reward function, the bipartite matching problem with an unknown objective function, and the single-machine scheduling problem with release times and unknown precedence constraints, with the objective of minimizing average completion time. We demonstrate that transformer models have remarkably strong performance and often produce near-optimal solutions in a fraction of a second. They can be particularly effective in the presence of more complex underlying objective functions and unknown implicit constraints compared to an LSTM-based alternative and inverse optimization.",

      "abstract": "MOOC recommendation systems have received increasing attention to help learners navigate and select preferred learning content. Traditional methods such as collaborative filtering and content-based filtering suffer from data sparsity and over-specialization. To alleviate these limitations, graph-based approaches have been proposed; however, they still rely heavily on manually predefined metapaths, which often capture only superficial structural relationships and impose substantial burdens on domain experts as well as significant engineering costs. To overcome these limitations, we propose AMR (Aspect-aware MOOC Recommendation), a novel framework that models path-specific multiple aspects by embedding the semantic content of nodes within each metapath. AMR automatically discovers metapaths through bi-directional walks, derives aspect-aware path representations using a bi-LSTM-based encoder, and incorporates these representations as edge features in the learner-learner and KC-KC subgraphs to achieve fine-grained semantically informed KC recommendations. Extensive experiments on the large-scale MOOCCube and PEEK datasets show that AMR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art graph neural network baselines across key metrics such as HR@K and nDCG@K. Further analysis confirms that AMR effectively captures rich path-specific aspect information, allowing more accurate recommendations than those methods that rely solely on predefined metapaths. The code will be available upon accepted.",

      "abstract": "Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have greatly extended the capabilities of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), demonstrating significant effectiveness across a wide range of complex and open-ended domains. However, despite this rapid progress, the field still relies heavily on empirical trial-and-error. It lacks a unified and principled scientific framework necessary for systematic optimization and improvement. This bottleneck stems from the ambiguity of attribution: first, the absence of a structured taxonomy of factors leaves researchers restricted to unguided adjustments; second, the lack of a unified metric fails to distinguish genuine collaboration gain from mere resource accumulation. In this paper, we advocate for a transition to design science through an integrated framework. We advocate to establish the collaboration gain metric ($Γ$) as the scientific standard to isolate intrinsic gains from increased budgets. Leveraging $Γ$, we propose a factor attribution paradigm to systematically identify collaboration-driving factors. To support this, we construct a systematic MAS factor library, structuring the design space into control-level presets and information-level dynamics. Ultimately, this framework facilitates the transition from blind experimentation to rigorous science, paving the way towards a true science of Collective AI.",

To advance existing research, we propose HealthMamba, an uncertainty-aware spatiotemporal framework for accurate and reliable healthcare facility visit prediction. HealthMamba comprises three key components: (i) a Unified Spatiotemporal Context Encoder that fuses heterogeneous static and dynamic information, (ii) a novel Graph State Space Model called GraphMamba for hierarchical spatiotemporal modeling, and (iii) a comprehensive uncertainty quantification module integrating three uncertainty quantification mechanisms for reliable prediction. We evaluate HealthMamba on four large-scale real-world datasets from California, New York, Texas, and Florida.

      "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as an indispensable paradigm for enhancing reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, standard policy optimization methods, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), often converge to low-entropy policies, leading to severe mode collapse and limited output diversity. We analyze this issue from the perspective of sampling probability dynamics, identifying that the standard objective disproportionately reinforces the highest-likelihood paths, thereby suppressing valid alternative reasoning chains. To address this, we propose a novel Advantage Re-weighting Mechanism (ARM) designed to equilibrate the confidence levels across all correct responses. By incorporating Prompt Perplexity and Answer Confidence into the advantage estimation, our method dynamically reshapes the reward signal to attenuate the gradient updates of over-confident reasoning paths, while redistributing probability mass toward under-explored correct solutions. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances generative diversity and response entropy while maintaining competitive accuracy, effectively achieving a superior trade-off between exploration and exploitation in reasoning tasks. Empirical results on Qwen2.5 and DeepSeek models across mathematical and coding benchmarks show that ProGRPO significantly mitigates entropy collapse. Specifically, on Qwen2.5-7B, our method outperforms GRPO by 5.7% in Pass@1 and, notably, by 13.9% in Pass@32, highlighting its superior capability in generating diverse correct reasoning paths.",

However, deploying adaptive controllers to implement such dynamic scaling in operational networks is challenging due to the risk of breaching service agreements and operational constraints. To mitigate this challenge, we present a novel method for learning the safe operating region of the RAN, i.e., the set of resource allocations and network configurations for which its specification is fulfilled. The method, which we call (C)ausal (O)nline (L)earning, operates in two online phases: an inference phase and an intervention phase. In the first phase, we passively observe the RAN to infer an initial safe region via causal inference and Gaussian process regression. In the second phase, we gradually expand this region through interventional Bayesian learning. We prove that COL ensures that the learned region is safe with a specified probability and that it converges to the full safe region under standard conditions. We experimentally validate COL on a 5G testbed. The results show that COL quickly learns the safe region while incurring low operational cost and being up to 10x more sample-efficient than current state-of-the-art methods for safe learning.",

Validating patches against their intended semantics is difficult due to incomplete regression tests and informal, non-executable natural language (NL) descriptions of patch intent. We present PatchGuru, the first automated technique that infers executable patch specifications from real-world pull requests (PRs). Given a PR, PatchGuru uses large language models (LLMs) to extract developer intent from NL artifacts and synthesizes patch oracles: under-approximate yet practical specifications expressed as runtime assertions in comparison programs that integrate pre- and post-patch versions. Patch oracles focus on patch-relevant behaviors, enable automated validation, and support cross-version properties. PatchGuru iteratively refines inferred oracles by comparing pre- and post-patch behaviors, identifies violations, filters inconsistencies via self-review, and generates bug reports. We evaluate PatchGuru on 400 recent PRs from four widely used open-source Python projects. PatchGuru reports 39 warnings with a precision of 0.62, yielding 24 confirmed true positives, including 12 previously unknown bugs, 11 of which were subsequently fixed by developers. Compared to the state-of-the-art technique Testora, PatchGuru detects 17 more bugs (24 vs. 7) while improving precision from 0.32 to 0.62. PatchGuru incurs an average cost of 8.9 minutes and USD 0.07 per PR.

During RLVR training, an increase in response length is often regarded as a key factor contributing to the growth of reasoning ability. However, the patterns of change in response length vary significantly across different RLVR algorithms during the training process. To provide a fundamental explanation for these variations, this paper conducts an in-depth analysis of the components of mainstream RLVR algorithms. We present a theoretical analysis of the factors influencing response length and validate our theory through extensive experimentation. Building upon these theoretical findings, we propose the Length-Unbiased Sequence Policy Optimization (LUSPO) algorithm. Specifically, we rectify the length bias inherent in Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO), rendering its loss function unbiased with respect to response length and thereby resolving the issue of response length collapse. We conduct extensive experiments across mathematical reasoning benchmarks and multimodal reasoning scenarios, where LUSPO consistently achieves superior performance.

In this work, we unify these seemingly distinct objectives through a minimalist intervention, namely CoPE: soft clipping lowfrequency components of RoPE. CoPE not only eliminates OOD outliers and refines semantic signals, but also prevents spectral leakage caused by hard clipping. Extensive experiments demonstrate that simply applying our soft clipping strategy to RoPE yields significant performance gains that scale up to 256k context length, validating our theoretical analysis and establishing CoPE as a new state-of-the-art for length generalization.

      "abstract": "Although point defects in hexagonal boron nitride exhibiting single-photon emission attract considerable interest, a broader understanding of defect physics and chemistry in hBN remains limited, potentially hindering further development. Oxygen is among the most common impurities in hBN, and numerous studies have reported a pronounced photoluminescence band centered near 3.5 eV following oxygen incorporation, yet its microscopic origin has remained unresolved. Here, we demonstrate that this emission originates from hole capture by neutral oxygen substituting for nitrogen (ON). The transition mechanism is non-trivial, involving not only a change in charge state but also a substantial structural reconfiguration: the positive and neutral states exhibit markedly different geometries and symmetries. In the neutral state the defect adopts a low-symmetry configuration with out-of-plane displacements of the oxygen and neighboring atoms. The calculated emission energy (3.63 eV) and lineshape are in excellent agreement with experiment.",

      "abstract": "Phase transitions impose topological constraints on thermodynamic state variables, masking energetic fluctuations at the phase boundary. This constraint is most apparent in melting systems, where temperature remains pinned despite continued energy input. Here we resolve this information loss by introducing a latent temperature-a counterfactual trajectory describing the system's unconstrained thermal evolution. We show that energy conservation alone enforces a rigorous duality between the total latent heat dissipated during phase change and the accumulated exceedance of the latent temperature above the melting point. This duality is mathematically equivalent to the one-dimensional Wasserstein-1 distance between the latent and observed temperature trajectories, with the transport cost set by a characteristic surface dissipation timescale and melting energy. Applied to ice-sheet surface melting, this timescale admits a direct physical interpretation in terms of radiative and turbulent heat loss. The same framework yields a first-principles derivation of the empirical Positive Degree Day law and predicts realistic degree-day factors that emerge from surface energy balance, without ad hoc calibration. More broadly, phase change emerges as an optimal transport process that projects continuous energetic variability onto a constrained thermodynamic boundary.",

While single-photon emission from QDs has reached a high level of maturity, the realization of high-fidelity entangled photon-pair sources remains an active and rapidly evolving frontier. In this review, we survey the recent progress in QD-based entangled photon sources, highlighting the conceptual evolution from the established biexciton-exciton cascade to the emerging paradigm of spontaneous two-photon emission. We further examine how advances in nanophotonic architectures and coherent control strategies are redefining fundamental performance limits, enabling concurrent improvements in source brightness, coherence, and entanglement fidelity. Finally, we discuss the key physical and technological challenges that must be addressed to bridge the gap between laboratory demonstrations and large-scale deployment.

Structured pruning can reduce inference cost, but most methods rely on retraining or multi-stage optimization. These requirements limit post-training deployment. We propose \\textbf{CORP}, a closed-form one-shot structured pruning framework for Vision Transformers. CORP removes entire MLP hidden dimensions and attention substructures without labels, gradients, or fine-tuning. It operates under strict post-training constraints using only a small unlabeled calibration set. CORP formulates structured pruning as a representation recovery problem. It models removed activations and attention logits as affine functions of retained components and derives closed-form ridge regression solutions that fold compensation into model weights. This minimizes expected representation error under the calibration distribution. Experiments on ImageNet with DeiT models show strong redundancy in MLP and attention representations. Without compensation, one-shot structured pruning causes severe accuracy degradation. With CORP, models preserve accuracy under aggressive sparsity. On DeiT-Huge, CORP retains 82.8\\% Top-1 accuracy after pruning 50\\% of both MLP and attention structures. CORP completes pruning in under 20 minutes on a single GPU and delivers substantial real-world efficiency gains.",

However, its practical adoption remains limited due to significant computational overhead, primarily driven by two key challenges: (1) the high cost associated with deploying excessively large ensembles, and (2) the lack of a reliable mechanism for selecting the optimal candidate solution, ultimately constraining the performance gains that can be realized. To address these challenges, we propose Entropy-Guided Stepwise Scaling (EGSS), a novel TTS framework that dynamically balances efficiency and effectiveness through entropy-guided adaptive search and robust test-suite augmentation. Extensive experiments on SWE-Bench-Verified demonstrate that EGSS consistently boosts performance by 5-10% across all evaluated models. Specifically, it increases the resolved ratio of Kimi-K2-Intruct from 63.2% to 72.2%, and GLM-4.6 from 65.8% to 74.6%. Furthermore, when paired with GLM-4.6, EGSS achieves a new state-of-the-art among open-source large language models. In addition to these accuracy improvements, EGSS reduces inference-time token usage by over 28% compared to existing TTS methods, achieving simultaneous gains in both effectiveness and computational efficiency.",

This research combines Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (GRAD-CAM), Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to provide comprehensive insights into the model's decision-making process. This multi-technique approach successfully identified both full and partial tumours, offering layered explanations ranging from broad regions of interest to pixel-level details. GRAD-CAM highlighted important spatial regions, LRP provided detailed pixel-level relevance and SHAP quantified feature contributions. The integrated approach effectively explained model predictions, including cases with partial tumour visibility thus showing superior explanatory power compared to individual XAI methods. This research enhances transparency and trust in AI-driven medical imaging analysis by offering a more comprehensive perspective on the model's reasoning.

To address this, we introduce an interpretability method called Impact Range Assessment (IRA), which quantifies the maximal influence of each predictor by measuring the total potential change in the response variable, across the predictor range. Validation using synthetic linear and nonlinear datasets demonstrates that relevant predictors produced higher IRA values than irrelevant ones. Moreover, repeated evaluations produced results closely aligned with those from the single-execution analysis, confirming the robustness of the method. A case study using a model that predicts pellet quality demonstrated that the IRA provides a simple and intuitive approach to interpret and rank predictor influence, thereby improving model transparency and reliability.",

      "abstract": "The evaluation of hydrological models is essential for both model selection and reliability assessment. However, simply comparing predictions to observations is insufficient for understanding the global landscape of model behavior. This is especially true for many deep learning models, whose structures are complex. Further, in risk-averse operational settings, water managers require models that are trustworthy and provably safe, as non-robustness can put our critical infrastructure at risk. Motivated by the need to select reliable models for operational deployment, we introduce and explore adversarial robustness analysis in hydrological modeling, evaluating whether small, targeted perturbations to meteorological forcings induce substantial changes in simulated discharge. We compare physical-conceptual and deep learning-based hydrological models across 1,347 German catchments under perturbations of varying magnitudes, using the fast gradient sign method (FGSM). We find that, as expected, the FGSM perturbations systematically reduce KGE and increase MSE. However, catastrophic failure is rare and, surprisingly, LSTMs generally demonstrate greater robustness than HBV models. Further, changes in both the predicted hydrographs and the internal model states often respond approximately linearly (at least locally) as perturbation size increases, providing a compact summary of how errors grow under such perturbations. Similar patterns are also observed for random perturbations, suggesting that small input changes usually introduce approximately proportional changes in model output. Overall, these findings support further consideration of LSTMs for operational deployment (due both to their predictive power and robustness), and motivate future work on both characterizing model responses to input changes and improving robustness through architectural modifications and training design.",

The proposed kernel estimator is compared in simulated experiments to the conventional method using spherical wave functions and an established physics-informed machine learning model, achieving lower interpolation error by approximately 2 dB on average within the analyzed frequencies of 100 Hz and 2.5 kHz and reconstructing the ground truth sound field more consistently within the target region.",

These gradient flows are based on new transportation-based Riemannian geometries on the space of probability measures: the Radon--Wasserstein geometry and the related Regularized Radon--Wasserstein (RRW) geometry. We define these geometries using the Radon transform so that the gradient-flow velocities depend only on one-dimensional projections. This yields interacting-particle-based algorithms whose per-step cost follows from efficient Fast Fourier Transform-based evaluation of the required 1D convolutions. We additionally provide numerical experiments that study the performance of the proposed algorithms and compare convergence behavior and quantization. Finally, we prove some theoretical results including well-posedness of the flows and long-time convergence guarantees for the RRW flow.",

      "abstract": "Central banks rely on density forecasts from professional surveys to assess inflation risks and communicate uncertainty. A central challenge in using these surveys is irregular participation: forecasters enter and exit, skip rounds, and reappear after long gaps. In the European Central Bank's Survey of Professional Forecasters, turnover and missingness vary substantially over time, causing the set of submitted predictions to change from quarter to quarter. Standard aggregation rules -- such as equal-weight pooling, renormalization after dropping missing forecasters, or ad hoc imputation -- can generate artificial jumps in combined predictions driven by panel composition rather than economic information, complicating real-time interpretation and obscuring forecaster performance. We develop coherent Bayesian updating rules for forecast combination under sporadic participation that maintain a well-defined latent predictive state for each forecaster even when their forecast is unobserved. Rather than relying on renormalization or imputation, the combined predictive distribution is updated through the implied conditional structure of the panel. This approach isolates genuine performance differences from mechanical participation effects and yields interpretable dynamics in forecaster influence. In the ECB survey, it improves predictive accuracy relative to equal-weight benchmarks and delivers smoother and better-calibrated inflation density forecasts, particularly during periods of high turnover.",

      "abstract": "Current audio foundation models typically rely on rigid, task-specific supervision, addressing isolated factors of audio rather than the whole. In contrast, human intelligence processes audio holistically, seamlessly bridging physical signals with abstract cognitive concepts to execute complex tasks. Grounded in this philosophy, we introduce Bagpiper, an 8B audio foundation model that interprets physical audio via rich captions, i.e., comprehensive natural language descriptions that encapsulate the critical cognitive concepts inherent in the signal (e.g., transcription, audio events). By pre-training on a massive corpus of 600B tokens, the model establishes a robust bidirectional mapping between raw audio and this high-level conceptual space. During fine-tuning, Bagpiper adopts a caption-then-process workflow, simulating an intermediate cognitive reasoning step to solve diverse tasks without task-specific priors. Experimentally, Bagpiper outperforms Qwen-2.5-Omni on MMAU and AIRBench for audio understanding and surpasses CosyVoice3 and TangoFlux in generation quality, capable of synthesizing arbitrary compositions of speech, music, and sound effects. To the best of our knowledge, Bagpiper is among the first works that achieve unified understanding generation for general audio. Model, data, and code are available at Bagpiper Home Page.",

      "abstract": "Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation aims to segment categories in data-scarce domains conditioned on a few exemplars. Typical methods first establish few-shot capability in a large-scale source domain and then adapt it to target domains. However, due to the limited quantity and diversity of target samples, existing methods still exhibit constrained performance. Moreover, the source-trained model's initially weak few-shot capability in target domains, coupled with substantial domain gaps, severely hinders the effective utilization of target samples and further impedes adaptation. To this end, we propose Multi-view Progressive Adaptation, which progressively adapts few-shot capability to target domains from both data and strategy perspectives. (i) From the data perspective, we introduce Hybrid Progressive Augmentation, which progressively generates more diverse and complex views through cumulative strong augmentations, thereby creating increasingly challenging learning scenarios. (ii) From the strategy perspective, we design Dual-chain Multi-view Prediction, which fully leverages these progressively complex views through sequential and parallel learning paths under extensive supervision. By jointly enforcing prediction consistency across diverse and complex views, MPA achieves both robust and accurate adaptation to target domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MPA effectively adapts few-shot capability to target domains, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by a large margin (+7.0%).",

Existing methods often match start and end frames by comparing frame features with two separate tokens, relying heavily on exact timestamps. However, this approach fails to capture the event's semantic continuity and integrity, leading to ambiguities. To address this, we propose E.M.Ground, a novel Vid-LLM for TVG that focuses on holistic and coherent event perception. E.M.Ground introduces three key innovations: (i) a special <event> token that aggregates information from all frames of a query event, preserving semantic continuity for accurate event matching; (ii) Savitzky-Golay smoothing to reduce noise in token-to-frame similarities across timestamps, improving prediction accuracy; (iii) multi-grained frame feature aggregation to enhance matching reliability and temporal understanding, compensating for compression-induced information loss. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that E.M.Ground consistently outperforms state-of-the-art Vid-LLMs by significant margins.",

Recent advances in generative modeling have introduced new paradigms for learning such representations.

In this work, we propose a flow matching-based framework for disentangled representation learning, which casts disentanglement as learning factor-conditioned flows in a compact latent space. To enforce explicit semantic alignment, we introduce a non-overlap (orthogonality) regularizer that suppresses cross-factor interference and reduces information leakage between factors. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate consistent improvements over representative baselines, yielding higher disentanglement scores as well as improved controllability and sample fidelity.",

      "abstract": "While recent neural codecs achieve strong performance at low bitrates when optimized for perceptual quality, their effectiveness deteriorates significantly under ultra-low bitrate conditions. To mitigate this, generative compression methods leveraging semantic priors from pretrained models have emerged as a promising paradigm. However, existing approaches are fundamentally constrained by a tradeoff between semantic faithfulness and perceptual realism. Methods based on explicit representations preserve content structure but often lack fine-grained textures, whereas implicit methods can synthesize visually plausible details at the cost of semantic drift. In this work, we propose a unified framework that bridges this gap by coherently integrating explicit and implicit representations in a training-free manner. Specifically, We condition a diffusion model on explicit high-level semantics while employing reverse-channel coding to implicitly convey fine-grained details. Moreover, we introduce a plug-in encoder that enables flexible control of the distortion-perception tradeoff by modulating the implicit information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art rate-perception performance, outperforming existing methods and surpassing DiffC by 29.92%, 19.33%, and 20.89% in DISTS BD-Rate on the Kodak, DIV2K, and CLIC2020 datasets, respectively.",

To address these limitations, we propose ARCHI-TTS that features a dedicated semantic aligner to ensure robust temporal and semantic consistency between text and audio. To overcome high computational inference costs, ARCHI-TTS employs an efficient inference strategy that reuses encoder features across denoising steps, drastically accelerating synthesis without performance degradation. An auxiliary CTC loss applied to the condition encoder further enhances the semantic understanding. Experimental results demonstrate that ARCHI-TTS achieves a WER of 1.98% on LibriSpeech-PC test-clean, and 1.47%/1.42% on SeedTTS test-en/test-zh with a high inference efficiency, consistently outperforming recent state-of-the-art TTS systems.",

      "abstract": "Accurate forecasting of extreme weather events such as heavy rainfall or storms is critical for risk management and disaster mitigation. Although high-resolution radar observations have spurred extensive research on nowcasting models, precipitation nowcasting remains particularly challenging due to pronounced spatial locality, intricate fine-scale rainfall structures, and variability in forecasting horizons. While recent diffusion-based generative ensembles show promising results, they are computationally expensive and unsuitable for real-time applications. In contrast, deterministic models are computationally efficient but remain biased toward normal rainfall. Furthermore, the benchmark datasets commonly used in prior studies are themselves skewed--either dominated by ordinary rainfall events or restricted to extreme rainfall episodes--thereby hindering general applicability in real-world settings. In this paper, we propose exPreCast, an efficient deterministic framework for generating finely detailed radar forecasts, and introduce a newly constructed balanced radar dataset from the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA), which encompasses both ordinary precipitation and extreme events. Our model integrates local spatiotemporal attention, a texture-preserving cubic dual upsampling decoder, and a temporal extractor to flexibly adjust forecasting horizons. Experiments on established benchmarks (SEVIR and MeteoNet) as well as on the balanced KMA dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering accurate and reliable nowcasts across both normal and extreme rainfall regimes.",

This study explores the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) problem and three of its variants involving a sequence and a pangenome graph. We present four polynomial-time reductions that transform these LCS-related problems into the longest path problem in a directed acyclic graph (DAG).

      "abstract": "As long-context inference becomes central to large language models (LLMs), attention over growing key-value caches emerges as a dominant decoding bottleneck, motivating sparse attention for scalable inference. Fixed-budget top-k sparse attention cannot adapt to heterogeneous attention distributions across heads and layers, whereas top-p sparse attention directly preserves attention mass and provides stronger accuracy guarantees. Existing top-p methods, however, fail to jointly optimize top-p accuracy, selection overhead, and sparse attention cost, which limits their overall efficiency. We present Double-P, a hierarchical sparse attention framework that optimizes all three stages. Double-P first performs coarse-grained top-p estimation at the cluster level using size-weighted centroids, then adaptively refines computation through a second top-p stage that allocates token-level attention only when needed. Across long-context benchmarks, Double-P consistently achieves near-zero accuracy drop, reducing attention computation overhead by up to 1.8x and delivers up to 1.3x end-to-end decoding speedup over state-of-the-art fixed-budget sparse attention methods.",

Research has demonstrated that large language models (LLMs) can be effectively utilized for social media moderation tasks, including harmful content detection. While proprietary LLMs have been shown to zero-shot outperform traditional machine learning models, the out-of-the-box capability of open-weight LLMs remains an open question.   Motivated by recent developments of reasoning LLMs, we evaluate seven state-of-the-art models: four proprietary and three open-weight. Testing with real-world posts on Bluesky, moderation decisions by Bluesky Moderation Service, and annotations by two authors, we find a considerable degree of overlap between the sensitivity (81%--97%) and specificity (91%--100%) of the open-weight LLMs and those (72%--98%, and 93%--99%) of the proprietary ones. Additionally, our analysis reveals that specificity exceeds sensitivity for rudeness detection, but the opposite holds for intolerance and threats. Lastly, we identify inter-rater agreement across human moderators and the LLMs, highlighting considerations for deploying LLMs in both platform-scale and personalized moderation contexts. These findings show open-weight LLMs can support privacy-preserving moderation on consumer-grade hardware and suggest new directions for designing moderation systems that balance community values with individual user preferences.",

However, existing spectral operators rely on static Fourier kernels applied uniformly across inputs, limiting their ability to capture multi-scale, regime-dependent, and anisotropic dynamics governed by the global state of the system. We introduce SpectraKAN, a neural operator that conditions the spectral operator on the input itself, turning static spectral convolution into an input-conditioned integral operator. This is achieved by extracting a compact global representation from spatio-temporal history and using it to modulate a multi-scale Fourier trunk via single-query cross-attention, enabling the operator to adapt its behaviour while retaining the efficiency of spectral mixing. We provide theoretical justification showing that this modulation converges to a resolution-independent continuous operator under mesh refinement and KAN gives smooth, Lipschitz-controlled global modulation. Across diverse PDE benchmarks, SpectraKAN achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing RMSE by up to 49% over strong baselines, with particularly large gains on challenging spatio-temporal prediction tasks.",

We show that solving the Gap-CLC problem in sub-quadratic time is highly unlikely unless the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH) fails -- even when restricted to binary alphabets. Furthermore, we establish that the Edit-CLC problem is NP-hard in the presence of errors within the graph. These findings emphasize that incorporating co-linear structures into sequence-to-graph alignment models fails to reduce computational complexity, highlighting that these models remain at least as computationally challenging to solve as those lacking such prior information.",

In this work, we analyze large-scale reinforcement learning training runs from the sophisticated environment of Full-Press Diplomacy by applying pretrained SAEs, alongside LLM-summarizer methods. We introduce Meta-Autointerp, a method for grouping SAE features into interpretable hypotheses about training dynamics. We discover fine-grained behaviors including role-playing patterns, degenerate outputs, language switching, alongside high-level strategic behaviors and environment-specific bugs. Through automated evaluation, we validate that 90% of discovered SAE Meta-Features are significant, and find a surprising reward hacking behavior. However, through two user studies, we find that even subjectively interesting and seemingly helpful SAE features may be worse than useless to humans, along with most LLM generated hypotheses. However, a subset of SAE-derived hypotheses are predictively useful for downstream tasks. We further provide validation by augmenting an untrained agent's system prompt, improving the score by +14.2%. Overall, we show that SAEs and LLM-summarizer provide complementary views into agent behavior, and together our framework forms a practical starting point for future data-centric interpretability work on ensuring trustworthy LLM behavior throughout training.",

      "title": "From Sequential to Parallel: Reformulating Dynamic Programming as GPU Kernels for Large-Scale Stochastic Combinatorial Optimization",
      "abstract": "A major bottleneck in scenario-based Sample Average Approximation (SAA) for stochastic programming (SP) is the cost of solving an exact second-stage problem for every scenario, especially when each scenario contains an NP-hard combinatorial structure. This has led much of the SP literature to restrict the second stage to linear or simplified models. We develop a GPU-based framework that makes full-fidelity integer second-stage models tractable at scale. The key innovation is a set of hardware-aware, scenario-batched GPU kernels that expose parallelism across scenarios, dynamic-programming (DP) layers, and route or action options, enabling Bellman updates to be executed in a single pass over more than 1,000,000 realizations. We evaluate the approach in two representative SP settings: a vectorized split operator for stochastic vehicle routing and a DP for inventory reinsertion. Implementation scales nearly linearly in the number of scenarios and achieves a one-two to four-five orders of magnitude speedup, allowing far larger scenario sets and reliably stronger first-stage decisions. The computational leverage directly improves decision quality: much larger scenario sets and many more first-stage candidates can be evaluated within fixed time budgets, consistently yielding stronger SAA solutions. Our results show that full-fidelity integer second-stage models are tractable at scales previously considered impossible, providing a practical path to large-scale, realistic stochastic discrete optimization.",

      "abstract": "Coastal hypoxia, especially in the northern part of Gulf of Mexico, presents a persistent ecological and economic concern. Seasonal models offer coarse forecasts that miss the fine-scale variability needed for daily, responsive ecosystem management. We present study that compares four deep learning architectures for daily hypoxia classification: Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), Medformer (Medical Transformer), Spatio-Temporal Transformer (ST-Transformer), and Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN). We trained our models with twelve years of daily hindcast data from 2009-2020 Our training data consists of 2009-2020 hindcast data from a coupled hydrodynamic-biogeochemical model. Similarly, we use hindcast data from 2020 through 2024 as a test data. We constructed classification models incorporating water column stratification, sediment oxygen consumption, and temperature-dependent decomposition rates. We evaluated each architectures using the same data preprocessing, input/output formulation, and validation protocols. Each model achieved high classification accuracy and strong discriminative ability with ST-Transformer achieving the highest performance across all metrics and tests periods (AUC-ROC: 0.982-0.992). We also employed McNemar's method to identify statistically significant differences in model predictions. Our contribution is a reproducible framework for operational real-time hypoxia prediction that can support broader efforts in the environmental and ocean modeling systems community and in ecosystem resilience.

      "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has proven effective for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, dominant approaches like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) face critical stability challenges: they suffer from high estimator variance under computational constraints (small group sizes) and vanishing gradient signals in saturated failure regimes where all responses yield identical zero rewards. To address this, we propose Empirical Bayes Policy Optimization (EBPO), a novel framework that regularizes local group-based baselines by borrowing strength from the policy's accumulated global statistics. Instead of estimating baselines in isolation, EBPO employs a shrinkage estimator that dynamically balances local group statistics with a global prior updated via Welford's online algorithm. Theoretically, we demonstrate that EBPO guarantees strictly lower Mean Squared Error (MSE), bounded entropy decay, and non-vanishing penalty signals in failure scenarios compared to GRPO. Empirically, EBPO consistently outperforms GRPO and other established baselines across diverse benchmarks, including AIME and OlympiadBench. Notably, EBPO exhibits superior training stability, achieving high-performance gains even with small group sizes, and benefits significantly from difficulty-stratified curriculum learning.",

To surmount these challenges, we propose SHaSaM (Submodular Hard Sample Mining), a novel combinatorial approach that models fairness-driven representation learning as a submodular hard-sample mining problem. Our two-stage approach comprises of SHaSaM-MINE, which introduces a submodular subset selection strategy to mine hard positives and negatives - effectively mitigating data imbalance, and SHaSaM-LEARN, which introduces a family of combinatorial loss functions based on Submodular Conditional Mutual Information to maximize the decision boundary between target classes while minimizing the influence of sensitive attributes. This unified formulation restricts the model from learning features tied to sensitive attributes, significantly enhancing fairness without sacrificing performance. Experiments on CelebA and UTKFace demonstrate that SHaSaM achieves state-of-the-art results, with up to 2.7 points improvement in model fairness (Equalized Odds) and a 3.5% gain in Accuracy, within fewer epochs as compared to existing methods.",

      "abstract": "Sensing gloves have become important tools for teleoperation and robotic policy learning as they are able to provide rich signals like speed, acceleration and tactile feedback. A common approach to track gloved hands is to directly use the sensor signals (e.g., angular velocity, gravity orientation) to estimate 3D hand poses. However, sensor-based tracking can be restrictive in practice as the accuracy is often impacted by sensor signal and calibration quality. Recent advances in vision-based approaches have achieved strong performance on human hands via large-scale pre-training, but their performance on gloved hands with distinct visual appearances remains underexplored. In this work, we present the first systematic evaluation of vision-based hand tracking models on gloved hands under both zero-shot and fine-tuning setups. Our analysis shows that existing bare-hand models suffer from substantial performance degradation on sensing gloves due to large appearance gap between bare-hand and glove designs. We therefore propose AirGlove, which leverages existing gloves to generalize the learned glove representations towards new gloves with limited data. Experiments with multiple sensing gloves show that AirGlove effectively generalizes the hand pose models to new glove designs and achieves a significant performance boost over the compared schemes.",

For instance, a mixture of A and B homopolymers of length $N$ segregates at $χ_{AB}^{cr} = 2/N$. But what if the difference between the blend components is subtler? We demonstrate that a mixture of AB copolymers with identical composition -- equal amounts of A and B monomers -- but different primary sequences can still phase separate. Incompatibility arises from distinct positional correlations between monomers of different chains. Calculating the Gaussian fluctuation correction to the free energy reveals that critical incompatibility from sequence differences follows a distinct yet universal scaling with chain length, $χ_{AB}^{cr} \\sim 1 / \\sqrt{N}$. This power law holds for both regular-sequence and statistical copolymers. A closed-form expression is derived for blends of block-alternating chains. The new theoretical scaling is confirmed by coarse-grained simulations, offering important insights into multiphase coexistence in biomolecular condensates.",

      "abstract": "Optical frequency combs (OFCs) are frequency rulers essential for precision metrology, next generation navigation, and testing of fundamental physics. Despite intense efforts, chip-integrated OFCs remain laboratory-bound, unable to fulfill their promise of compact and cost-effective deployment. While improvement in fabrication and integration are important, a conceptual limitation has fundamentally stymied progress: on-chip OFC architectures have aimed to miniaturize their table-top counterparts and relied on cascading outward from (i.e., spectrally broadening) a single pump. In integrated platforms, this approach does not readily allow for the generation of strong and low-noise octave-spaced signals that are crucially needed for robust zero-frequency offset detection. Here, we overcome this limitation via an architectural inversion where an optical microcomb forms by filling the spectrum between two octave-separated pump lasers. The two pumps generate a parametrically driven cavity soliton (PDCS) in an integrated $χ^{(3)}$ resonator, which robustly self-aligns to (i.e., synchronizes with) the pump lasers across multiple foundry-fabricated devices and operating configurations. This produces a single octave-spanning comb extending from telecom to visible wavelengths, whose zero-frequency offset is completely defined by the two harmonically-related pump lasers, and can therefore be reliably detected and stabilized. We showcase our platform's capabilities by executing all of the three core tasks of OFC metrology: optical frequency synthesis, low-noise millimeter-wave generation, and integrated optical clock readout, using the same self-aligned microcomb with only its input locks changed.",

      "abstract": "Machine systems inherently generate signals in which fault conditions and various physical variables are physically coupled. Although many existing fault classification studies rely solely on direct fault labels, the aforementioned signals naturally embed additional information shaped by other physically coupled information. Herein, we leverage this coupling through a multi-task learning (MTL) framework that jointly learns fault conditions and the related physical variables. Among MTL architectures, crosstalk structures have distinct advantages because they allow for controlled information exchange between tasks through the cross-talk layer while preventing negative transfer, in contrast to shared trunk architectures that often mix incompatible features. We build on our previously introduced residual neural dimension reductor model, and extend its application to two benchmarks where physical coupling is prominent. The first benchmark is a drone fault dataset, in which machine type and maneuvering direction significantly alter the frequency components of measured signals even under the same nominal condition. By learning fault classification together with these physical attributes, the cross-talk architecture can better classify faults. The second benchmark dataset is the motor compound fault dataset. In this system, each fault component, inner race fault, outer race fault, misalignment, and unbalance is coupled to the other. For motor compound fault, we also test classification performance when we use single-channel data or multi-channel data as input to the classifier. Across both benchmarks, our residual neural dimension reductor, consistently outperformed single-task models, multi-class models that merge all label combinations, and shared trunk multi-task models.",

Here, we develop a Deep Potential-based machine learning molecular dynamics (MLMD) framework, trained on extensive ab initio datasets and validated against experimental transport properties, to resolve early-stage SEI nucleation at lithium metal interfaces with quantum accuracy. We find that at the Li-metal interface, 3.5 M LiTFSI/DMC induces spontaneous, thermally activated reduction reactions, yielding rapidly growing thick anion-derived SEIs enriched in O/F-containing species. In contrast, 1.5-2.5 M LiTFSI/DMC and 1 M LiPF6/EMC/DMC/EC form thinner, LiF-dominated interphases with slower growth kinetics. Our modeling results are consistent with experimental observations, where 3.5 M LiTFSI enhances cycling stability and rate capability, while lower concentrations result in weaker passivation. Our MLMD framework efficiently captures the electrolyte transport and early-stage SEI formation mechanisms in LMBs.",

      "abstract": "Is the standard weight decay in AdamW truly optimal? Although AdamW decouples weight decay from adaptive gradient scaling, a fundamental conflict remains: the Radial Tug-of-War. In deep learning, gradients tend to increase parameter norms to expand effective capacity while steering directions to learn features, whereas weight decay indiscriminately suppresses norm growth. This push--pull interaction induces radial oscillations, injecting noise into Adam's second-moment estimates and potentially degrading delicate tangential feature learning. We argue that magnitude and direction play distinct roles and should be decoupled in optimizer dynamics. We propose Orthogonal Dynamics Decoupling and instantiate it as AdamO: an SGD-style update handles the one-dimensional norm control, while Adam's adaptive preconditioning is confined to the tangential subspace. AdamO further incorporates curvature-adaptive radial step sizing and architecture-aware rules and projections for scale-invariant layers and low-dimensional parameters. Experiments on vision and language tasks show that AdamO improves generalization and stability over AdamW without introducing additional complex constraints.",

      "abstract": "Real-world machine learning on tabular data relies on complex data preparation pipelines for prediction, data integration, augmentation, and debugging. Designing these pipelines requires substantial domain expertise and engineering effort, motivating the question of how large language models (LLMs) can support tabular ML through code synthesis. We introduce SemPipes, a novel declarative programming model that integrates LLM-powered semantic data operators into tabular ML pipelines. Semantic operators specify data transformations in natural language while delegating execution to a runtime system. During training, SemPipes synthesizes custom operator implementations based on data characteristics, operator instructions, and pipeline context. This design enables the automatic optimization of data operations in a pipeline via LLM-based code synthesis guided by evolutionary search. We evaluate SemPipes across diverse tabular ML tasks and show that semantic operators substantially improve end-to-end predictive performance for both expert-designed and agent-generated pipelines, while reducing pipeline complexity. We implement SemPipes in Python and release it at https://github.com/deem-data/sempipes/tree/v1.",

      "abstract": "Traffic prediction in data-scarce, cross-city settings is challenging due to complex nonlinear dynamics and domain shifts. Existing methods often fail to capture traffic's inherent chaotic nature for effective few-shot learning. We propose CAST-CKT, a novel Chaos-Aware Spatio-Temporal and Cross-City Knowledge Transfer framework. It employs an efficient chaotic analyser to quantify traffic predictability regimes, driving several key innovations: chaos-aware attention for regime-adaptive temporal modelling; adaptive topology learning for dynamic spatial dependencies; and chaotic consistency-based cross-city alignment for knowledge transfer. The framework also provides horizon-specific predictions with uncertainty quantification. Theoretical analysis shows improved generalisation bounds. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks in cross-city few-shot settings show CAST-CKT outperforms state-of-the-art methods by significant margins in MAE and RMSE, while offering interpretable regime analysis.

      "abstract": "Online egocentric gaze estimation predicts where a camera wearer is looking from first-person video using only past and current frames, a task essential for augmented reality and assistive technologies. Unlike third-person gaze estimation, this setting lacks explicit head or eye signals, requiring models to infer current visual attention from sparse, indirect cues such as hand-object interactions and salient scene content. We observe that gaze exhibits strong temporal continuity during goal-directed activities: knowing where a person looked recently provides a powerful prior for predicting where they look next. Inspired by vision-conditioned autoregressive decoding in vision-language models, we propose ARGaze, which reformulates gaze estimation as sequential prediction: at each timestep, a transformer decoder predicts current gaze by conditioning on (i) current visual features and (ii) a fixed-length Gaze Context Window of recent gaze target estimates. This design enforces causality and enables bounded-resource streaming inference. We achieve state-of-the-art performance across multiple egocentric benchmarks under online evaluation, with extensive ablations validating that autoregressive modeling with bounded gaze history is critical for robust prediction.

The Workflows Community Summit 2025, held in Amsterdam on June 6th, 2025, convened international experts to examine emerging challenges and opportunities in this domain. Participants identified key barriers to workflow adoption, including tensions between system generality and domain-specific utility, concerns over long-term sustainability of workflow systems and services, insufficient recognition for those who develop and maintain reproducible workflows, and gaps in standardization, funding, training, and cross-disciplinary collaboration. To address these challenges, the summit proposed action lines spanning technology, policy, and community dimensions: shifting evaluation metrics from raw computational performance toward measuring genuine scientific impact; formalizing workflow patterns and community-driven benchmarks to improve transparency, reproducibility, and usability; cultivating a cohesive international workflows community that engages funding bodies and research stakeholders; and investing in human capital through dedicated workflow engineering roles, career pathways, and integration of workflow concepts into educational curricula and long-term training initiatives. This document presents the summit's findings, beginning with an overview of the current computing ecosystem and the rationale for workflow-centric approaches, followed by a discussion of identified challenges and recommended action lines for advancing scientific discovery through workflows.",

Although attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) achieves strong slide-level prediction for HPV-related whole-slide histopathology, it provides limited morphologic interpretability. To address this limitation, we introduce Concept-Level Explainable Attention-guided Representation for HPV (CLEAR-HPV), a framework that restructures the MIL latent space using attention to enable concept discovery without requiring concept labels during training. Operating in an attention-weighted latent space, CLEAR-HPV automatically discovers keratinizing, basaloid, and stromal morphologic concepts, generates spatial concept maps, and represents each slide using a compact concept-fraction vector. CLEAR-HPV's concept-fraction vectors preserve the predictive information of the original MIL embeddings while reducing the high-dimensional feature space (e.g., 1536 dimensions) to only 10 interpretable concepts. CLEAR-HPV generalizes consistently across TCGA-HNSCC, TCGA-CESC, and CPTAC-HNSCC, providing compact, concept-level interpretability through a general, backbone-agnostic framework for attention-based MIL models of whole-slide histopathology.",

However, their reliance on potentially untrusted training pipelines or supply chains introduces significant security vulnerabilities. This paper investigates backdoor (Trojan) attacks against neural controllers, using a differential-drive mobile robot platform as a case study. In particular, assuming that the robot's tracking controller is implemented as a neural network, we design a lightweight, parallel Trojan network that can be embedded within the controller. This malicious module remains dormant during normal operation but, upon detecting a highly specific trigger condition defined by the robot's pose and goal parameters, compromises the primary controller's wheel velocity commands, resulting in undesired and potentially unsafe robot behaviours. We provide a proof-of-concept implementation of the proposed Trojan network, which is validated through simulation under two different attack scenarios. The results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed attack and demonstrate that neural network-based robotic control systems are subject to potentially critical security threats.",

      "abstract": "The proliferation of agentic systems has thrust the reasoning capabilities of AI into the forefront of contemporary machine learning. While it is known that there \\emph{exist} neural networks which can reason through any Boolean task $f:\\{0,1\\}^B\\to\\{0,1\\}$, in the sense that they emulate Boolean circuits with fan-in $2$ and fan-out $1$ gates, trained models have been repeatedly demonstrated to fall short of these theoretical ideals. This raises the question: \\textit{Can one exhibit a deep learning model which \\textbf{certifiably} always reasons and can \\textbf{universally} reason through any Boolean task?} Moreover, such a model should ideally require few parameters to solve simple Boolean tasks.   We answer this question affirmatively by exhibiting a deep learning architecture which parameterizes distributions over Boolean circuits with the guarantee that, for every parameter configuration, a sample is almost surely a valid Boolean circuit (and hence admits an intrinsic circuit-level certificate). We then prove a universality theorem: for any Boolean $f:\\{0,1\\}^B\\to\\{0,1\\}$, there exists a parameter configuration under which the sampled circuit computes $f$ with arbitrarily high probability. When $f$ is an $\\mathcal{O}(\\log B)$-junta, the required number of parameters scales linearly with the input dimension $B$.   Empirically, on a controlled truth-table completion benchmark aligned with our setting, the proposed architecture trains reliably and achieves high exact-match accuracy while preserving the predicted structure: every internal unit is Boolean-valued on $\\{0,1\\}^B$. Matched MLP baselines reach comparable accuracy, but only about $10\\%$ of hidden units admit a Boolean representation; i.e.\\ are two-valued over the Boolean cube.",

We present a framework for generating and evaluating large-scale isomorphic physics problem banks using Generative AI to enable asynchronous, multi-attempt assessments. Isomorphic problems test identical concepts through varied surface features and contexts, providing richer variation than conventional parameterized questions while maintaining consistent difficulty. Our generation framework employs prompt chaining and tool use to achieve precise control over structural variations (numeric values, spatial relations) alongside diverse contextual variations. For pre-deployment validation, we evaluate generated items using 17 open-source language models (LMs) (0.6B-32B) and compare against actual student performance (N>200) across three midterm exams. Results show that 73% of deployed banks achieve statistically homogeneous difficulty, and LMs pattern correlate strongly with student performance (Pearson's $ρ$ up to 0.594). Additionally, LMs successfully identify problematic variants, such as ambiguous problem texts. Model scale also proves critical for effective validation, where extremely small (<4B) and large (>14B) models exhibit floor and ceiling effects respectively, making mid-sized models optimal for detecting difficulty outliers.",

For classification, we propose a multimodal approach that integrates textual and acoustic information through Qwen2-Audio, allowing joint modeling of text and audio for implicit discourse relation classification across languages.

Extremal solutions are $N$-soliton solutions that achieve the theoretical maximal amplitude and diverge as $N \\to \\infty$. We consider extremal solutions with the discrete eigenvalues randomly drawn from sub-exponential distributions, and identify two distinct universality classes, determined by the macroscopic structure of the spectrum: the Painlevé--III rogue-wave solution, where the eigenvalues take the form $λ_j = v_j + i μ_j$, and the Painlevé--V rogue wave solution, where $λ_j = -ζ\\, j + v_j + i μ_j$, with $0 < ζ< 1$. (In both cases, $μ_{j}$ and $v_{j}$ are subexponential random variables.) Universality can then be summarized as follows: independently of the specific distribution of the eigenvalues, the rescaled solutions converge locally to a deterministic profile governed by the Painlevé-III equation in the first regime, and the Painlevé-V equation in the second. These results demonstrate that the formation of Painlevé-type rogue waves is a universal phenomenon robust to randomness.",

However, their decision-making processes remain opaque, operating as \"black boxes\" that obscure the rationale behind specific boundary predictions. This lack of transparency is a critical barrier in safety-critical applications where verification is mandatory. To bridge the gap between high-performance deep learning and interpretable logic, we propose the Rule-Based Spatial Mixture-of-Experts U-Net (sMoE U-Net). Our architecture introduces two key innovations: (1) Spatially-Adaptive Mixture-of-Experts (sMoE) blocks integrated into the decoder skip connections, which dynamically gate between \"Context\" (smooth) and \"Boundary\" (sharp) experts based on local feature statistics; and (2) a Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) Fuzzy Head that replaces the standard classification layer. This fuzzy head fuses deep semantic features with heuristic edge signals using explicit IF-THEN rules. We evaluate our method on the BSDS500 benchmark, achieving an Optimal Dataset Scale (ODS) F-score of 0.7628, effectively matching purely deep baselines like HED (0.7688) while outperforming the standard U-Net (0.7437).

      "abstract": "Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs), or A/B testing, have become the gold standard for optimizing various operational policies on online platforms. However, RCTs on these platforms typically cover a limited number of discrete treatment levels, while the platforms increasingly face complex operational challenges involving optimizing continuous variables, such as pricing and incentive programs. The current industry practice involves discretizing these continuous decision variables into several treatment levels and selecting the optimal discrete treatment level. This approach, however, often leads to suboptimal decisions as it cannot accurately extrapolate performance for untested treatment levels and fails to account for heterogeneity in treatment effects across user characteristics. This study addresses these limitations by developing a theoretically solid and empirically verified framework to learn personalized continuous policies based on high-dimensional user characteristics, using observations from an RCT with only a discrete set of treatment levels. Specifically, we introduce a deep learning for policy targeting (DLPT) framework that includes both personalized policy value estimation and personalized policy learning. We prove that our policy value estimators are asymptotically unbiased and consistent, and the learned policy achieves a root-n-regret bound. We empirically validate our methods in collaboration with a leading social media platform to optimize incentive levels for content creation. Results demonstrate that our DLPT framework significantly outperforms existing benchmarks, achieving substantial improvements in both evaluating the value of policies for each user group and identifying the optimal personalized policy.",

      "abstract": "Simulated environments are a key piece in the success of Reinforcement Learning (RL), allowing practitioners and researchers to train decision making agents without running expensive experiments on real hardware. Simulators remain a security blind spot, however, enabling adversarial developers to alter the dynamics of their released simulators for malicious purposes. Therefore, in this work we highlight a novel threat, demonstrating how simulator dynamics can be exploited to stealthily implant action-level backdoors into RL agents. The backdoor then allows an adversary to reliably activate targeted actions in an agent upon observing a predefined ``trigger'', leading to potentially dangerous consequences. Traditional backdoor attacks are limited in their strong threat models, assuming the adversary has near full control over an agent's training pipeline, enabling them to both alter and observe agent's rewards. As these assumptions are infeasible to implement within a simulator, we propose a new attack ``Daze'' which is able to reliably and stealthily implant backdoors into RL agents trained for real world tasks without altering or even observing their rewards. We provide formal proof of Daze's effectiveness in guaranteeing attack success across general RL tasks along with extensive empirical evaluations on both discrete and continuous action space domains. We additionally provide the first example of RL backdoor attacks transferring to real, robotic hardware. These developments motivate further research into securing all components of the RL training pipeline to prevent malicious attacks.",

      "abstract": "Systematic literature reviews (SLRs) are fundamental to evidence-based research, but manual screening is an increasing bottleneck as scientific output grows. Screening features low prevalence of relevant studies and scarce, costly expert decisions. Traditional active learning (AL) systems help, yet typically rely on fixed query strategies for selecting the next unlabeled documents. These static strategies do not adapt over time and ignore the relational structure of scientific literature networks. This thesis introduces AutoDiscover, a framework that reframes AL as an online decision-making problem driven by an adaptive agent. Literature is modeled as a heterogeneous graph capturing relationships among documents, authors, and metadata. A Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network (HAN) learns node representations, which a Discounted Thompson Sampling (DTS) agent uses to dynamically manage a portfolio of query strategies. With real-time human-in-the-loop labels, the agent balances exploration and exploitation under non-stationary review dynamics, where strategy utility changes over time. On the 26-dataset SYNERGY benchmark, AutoDiscover achieves higher screening efficiency than static AL baselines. Crucially, the agent mitigates cold start by bootstrapping discovery from minimal initial labels where static approaches fail. We also introduce TS-Insight, an open-source visual analytics dashboard to interpret, verify, and diagnose the agent's decisions. Together, these contributions accelerate SLR screening under scarce expert labels and low prevalence of relevant studies.",

      "abstract": "Strategic classification, where individuals modify their features to influence machine learning (ML) decisions, presents critical fairness challenges. While group fairness in this setting has been widely studied, individual fairness remains underexplored. We analyze threshold-based classifiers and prove that deterministic thresholds violate individual fairness. Then, we investigate the possibility of using a randomized classifier to achieve individual fairness. We introduce conditions under which a randomized classifier ensures individual fairness and leverage these conditions to find an optimal and individually fair randomized classifier through a linear programming problem. Additionally, we demonstrate that our approach can be extended to group fairness notions. Experiments on real-world datasets confirm that our method effectively mitigates unfairness and improves the fairness-accuracy trade-off.",

      "abstract": "Atmospheric blocking events drive persistent weather extremes in midlatitudes, but isolating the influence of sea surface temperature (SST) from chaotic internal atmospheric variability on these events remains a challenge. We address this challenge using century-long (1900-2010), large-ensemble simulations with two computationally efficient deep-learning general circulation models. We find these models skillfully reproduce the observed blocking climatology, matching or exceeding the performance of a traditional high-resolution model and representative CMIP6 models. Averaging the large ensembles filters internal atmospheric noise to isolate the SST-forced component of blocking variability, yielding substantially higher correlations with reanalysis than for individual ensemble members. We identify robust teleconnections linking Greenland blocking frequency to North Atlantic SST and El Niño-like patterns. Furthermore, SST-forced trends in blocking frequency show a consistent decline in winter over Greenland, and an increase over Europe. These results demonstrate that SST variability exerts a significant and physically interpretable influence on blocking frequency and establishes large ensembles from deep learning models as a powerful tool for separating forced SST signals from internal noise.",

      "abstract": "The problem with existing camera-based Deep Reinforcement Learning approaches is twofold: they rarely integrate high-level scene context into the feature representation, and they rely on rigid, fixed reward functions. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel pipeline that produces a neuro-symbolic feature representation that encompasses semantic, spatial, and shape information, as well as spatially boosted features of dynamic entities in the scene, with an emphasis on safety-critical road users. It also proposes a Soft First-Order Logic (SFOL) reward function that balances human values via a symbolic reasoning module. Here, semantic and spatial predicates are extracted from segmentation maps and applied to linguistic rules to obtain reward weights. Quantitative experiments in the CARLA simulation environment show that the proposed neuro-symbolic representation and SFOL reward function improved policy robustness and safety-related performance metrics compared to baseline representations and reward formulations across varying traffic densities and occlusion levels. The findings demonstrate that integrating holistic representations and soft reasoning into Reinforcement Learning can support more context-aware and value-aligned decision-making for autonomous driving.",

We show that the generators of these powers are images of the generators of the corresponding powers of extremal ideals under a specific ring homomorphism.   Extremal ideals provide sharp bounds for a variety of invariants widely studied in the literature, including resurgence, asymptotic resurgence, and symbolic defect, as well as Betti numbers of symbolic powers and of integral closures of powers of square-free monomial ideals. When restricted to the class of extremal ideals, algebraic computations are reduced to problems of discrete geometry and linear programming, allowing the use of a wide variety of techniques.   As a result, in situations where computations are feasible for extremal ideals, we provide concrete sharp bounds for many of these invariants. Our methods reduce finding homological invariants and algebraic constructions for infinitely many ideals to computations for a single highly symmetric ideal, based solely on the number of generators.",

      "abstract": "As the orbital environment around Earth becomes increasingly crowded with debris, active debris removal (ADR) missions face significant challenges in ensuring safe operations while minimizing the risk of in-orbit collisions. This study presents a reinforcement learning (RL) based framework to enhance adaptive collision avoidance in ADR missions, specifically for multi-debris removal using small satellites. Small satellites are increasingly adopted due to their flexibility, cost effectiveness, and maneuverability, making them well suited for dynamic missions such as ADR.   Building on existing work in multi-debris rendezvous, the framework integrates refueling strategies, efficient mission planning, and adaptive collision avoidance to optimize spacecraft rendezvous operations. The proposed approach employs a masked Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, enabling the RL agent to dynamically adjust maneuvers in response to real-time orbital conditions. Key considerations include fuel efficiency, avoidance of active collision zones, and optimization of dynamic orbital parameters.   The RL agent learns to determine efficient sequences for rendezvousing with multiple debris targets, optimizing fuel usage and mission time while incorporating necessary refueling stops. Simulated ADR scenarios derived from the Iridium 33 debris dataset are used for evaluation, covering diverse orbital configurations and debris distributions to demonstrate robustness and adaptability. Results show that the proposed RL framework reduces collision risk while improving mission efficiency compared to traditional heuristic approaches.   This work provides a scalable solution for planning complex multi-debris ADR missions and is applicable to other multi-target rendezvous problems in autonomous space mission planning.",

      "abstract": "The physics underlying reset in bipolar resistive memory has been the subject of decades of controversy and has been identified as the primary barrier to resistive memory technology development. This manuscript introduces a nanoscale effect in current carrying conductors, whereby surface charge induced radial electric fields are found to be inversely proportional to the radius of the conductive path. This nanoscale effect is then applied to explain the negative resistance switching (reset) mechanism in filamentary metal oxide resistive switching memory devices (memristors). Previous explanations for the negative resistive switching mechanism state that diffusion constitutes the radial driving mechanism for oxygen ions, and drift under electric fields is restricted to the direction parallel to current flow. This explanation conflicts with retention and microscopy data collected in a subset of devices presented in literature. We demonstrate that the electric field's dependency on the on the radius of a nanoscale conductive path can result in radial fields on the order of 10^5 to 10^6 V/cm at only -1 V bias, sufficient to govern the negative resistance switching mechanism in filamentary metal oxides. By accounting for this nanoscale size effect, long standing anomalous experimental data about the negative (reset) resistance switching mechanism in bipolar filamentary resistive memory devices is finally reconciled. Wide understanding of surface charges and associated electric fields in nanoscale conductive paths could prove important for further scaling of integrated circuits and aid in elucidating many nanoscale phenomena.",

      "abstract": "Dense retrieval, which encodes queries and documents into a single dense vector, has become the dominant neural retrieval approach due to its simplicity and compatibility with fast approximate nearest neighbor algorithms. As the tasks dense retrieval performs grow in complexity, the fundamental limitations of the underlying data structure and similarity metric -- namely vectors and inner-products -- become more apparent. Prior recent work has shown theoretical limitations inherent to single vectors and inner-products that are generally tied to the embedding dimension. Given the importance of embedding dimension for retrieval capacity, understanding how dense retrieval performance changes as embedding dimension is scaled is fundamental to building next generation retrieval models that balance effectiveness and efficiency. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the relationship between embedding dimension and retrieval performance. Our experiments include two model families and a range of model sizes from each to construct a detailed picture of embedding scaling behavior. We find that the scaling behavior fits a power law, allowing us to derive scaling laws for performance given only embedding dimension, as well as a joint law accounting for embedding dimension and model size. Our analysis shows that for evaluation tasks aligned with the training task, performance continues to improve as embedding size increases, though with diminishing returns. For evaluation data that is less aligned with the training task, we find that performance is less predictable, with performance degrading with larger embedding dimensions for certain tasks. We hope our work provides additional insight into the limitations of embeddings and their behavior as well as offers a practical guide for selecting model and embedding dimension to achieve optimal performance with reduced storage and compute costs.",

      "abstract": "Inclement weather conditions can significantly impact driver visibility and tire-road surface friction, requiring adjusted safe driving speeds to reduce crash risk. This study proposes a hybrid predictive framework that recommends real-time safe speed intervals for freeway travel under diverse weather conditions. Leveraging high-resolution Connected Vehicle (CV) data and Road Weather Information System (RWIS) data collected in Buffalo, NY, from 2022 to 2023, we construct a spatiotemporally aligned dataset containing over 6.6 million records across 73 days. The core model employs Quantile Regression Forests (QRF) to estimate vehicle speed distributions in 10-minute windows, using 26 input features that capture meteorological, pavement, and temporal conditions. To enforce safety constraints, a physics-based upper speed limit is computed for each interval based on real-time road grip and visibility, ensuring that vehicles can safely stop within their sight distance. The final recommended interval fuses QRF-predicted quantiles with both posted speed limits and the physics-derived upper bound. Experimental results demonstrate strong predictive performance: the QRF model achieves a mean absolute error of 1.55 mph, with 96.43% of median speed predictions within 5 mph, a PICP (50%) of 48.55%, and robust generalization across weather types. The model's ability to respond to changing weather conditions and generalize across road segments shows promise for real-world deployment, thereby improving traffic safety and reducing weather-related crashes.",

Planning problems in the open world often involve various aspects of incomplete information and unknowns, e.g., objects involved, human goals/intents -- thus leading to knowledge gaps in joint planning. We consider the problem of discovering optimal interaction strategies for AI agents to actively elicit human inputs in object-driven planning. To this end, we propose Minimal Information Neuro-Symbolic Tree (MINT) to reason about the impact of knowledge gaps and leverage self-play with MINT to optimize the AI agent's elicitation strategies and queries. More precisely, MINT builds a symbolic tree by making propositions of possible human-AI interactions and by consulting a neural planning policy to estimate the uncertainty in planning outcomes caused by remaining knowledge gaps. Finally, we leverage LLM to search and summarize MINT's reasoning process and curate a set of queries to optimally elicit human inputs for best planning performance. By considering a family of extended Markov decision processes with knowledge gaps, we analyze the return guarantee for a given MINT with active human elicitation. Our evaluation on three benchmarks involving unseen/unknown objects of increasing realism shows that MINT-based planning attains near-expert returns by issuing a limited number of questions per task while achieving significantly improved rewards and success rates.",

However, standard 3DGS relies on spherical harmonics, which often struggle to accurately capture high-frequency view-dependent effects such as sharp reflections and transparency. While hybrid approaches like Viewing Direction Gaussian Splatting (VDGS) mitigate this limitation using classical Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), they remain limited by the expressivity of classical networks in low-parameter regimes. In this paper, we introduce QuantumGS, a novel hybrid framework that integrates Variational Quantum Circuits (VQC) into the Gaussian Splatting pipeline. We propose a unique encoding strategy that maps the viewing direction directly onto the Bloch sphere, leveraging the natural geometry of qubits to represent 3D directional data. By replacing classical color-modulating networks with quantum circuits generated via a hypernetwork or conditioning mechanism, we achieve higher expressivity and better generalization.

This limited view of testing leads to failures in model integration, deployment, and operations. In traditional software development, quality models such as ISO 25010 provide a widely used structured framework to assess software quality, define quality requirements, and provide a common language for communication with stakeholders. A newer standard, ISO 25059, defines a more specific quality model for AI systems. However, a problem with this standard is that it combines system attributes with ML component attributes, which is not helpful for a model developer, as many system attributes cannot be assessed at the component level. In this paper, we present a quality model for ML components that serves as a guide for requirements elicitation and negotiation and provides a common vocabulary for ML component developers and system stakeholders to agree on and define system-derived requirements and focus their testing efforts accordingly. The quality model was validated through a survey in which the participants agreed with its relevance and value. The quality model has been successfully integrated into an open-source tool for ML component testing and evaluation demonstrating its practical application.",

      "abstract": "Learning meaningful causal representations from observations has emerged as a crucial task for facilitating machine learning applications and driving scientific discoveries in fields such as climate science, biology, and physics. This process involves disentangling high-level latent variables and their causal relationships from low-level observations. Previous work in this area that achieves identifiability typically focuses on cases where the observations are either i.i.d. or follow a latent discrete-time process. Nevertheless, many real-world settings require identifying latent variables that are continuous-time stochastic processes (e.g., multivariate point processes). To this end, we develop identifiable causal representation learning for continuous-time latent stochastic point processes. We study its identifiability by analyzing the geometry of the parameter space. Furthermore, we develop MUTATE, an identifiable variational autoencoder framework with a time-adaptive transition module to infer stochastic dynamics. Across simulated and empirical studies, we find that MUTATE can effectively answer scientific questions, such as the accumulation of mutations in genomics and the mechanisms driving neuron spike triggers in response to time-varying dynamics.",

In decision-time planning, state representations are critical as they must support local cost computation while preserving long-horizon structure. In this paper, we show that the Laplacian representation provides an effective latent space for planning by capturing state-space distances at multiple time scales. This representation preserves meaningful distances and naturally decomposes long-horizon problems into subgoals, also mitigating the compounding errors that arise over long prediction horizons. Building on these properties, we introduce ALPS, a hierarchical planning algorithm, and demonstrate that it outperforms commonly used baselines on a selection of offline goal-conditioned RL tasks from OGBench, a benchmark previously dominated by model-free methods.",

Our model solves a series of constrained optimization problems to estimate physically consistent scene parameters, such as meshes, lighting conditions, material properties, and 6D poses of previously unseen objects from a single RGBD image and bounding boxes. We evaluated our approach on standard model-free few-shot benchmarks and demonstrated that it outperforms existing algorithms for model-free few-shot pose estimation. Furthermore, we validated the accuracy of our scene reconstructions by applying our algorithm to a zero-shot grasping task. By enabling zero-shot, physically-consistent scene reconstruction and grasping without reliance on extensive datasets or test-time sampling, our approach offers a pathway towards more data efficient, interpretable and generalizable robot autonomy in novel environments.",

To better understand the origin of the stellar substructures and constrain their past orbit, we model the past 2.5 Gyr of the interactions between the MW and the LMC and SMC using N-body simulations. Due to the strong interactions, analytical orbit integrations are insufficient to analyze the past galaxy orbits accurately. Therefore, we use a genetic algorithm in combination with N-body simulations to determine the LMC and SMC initial positions and velocities 2.5 Gyr ago that result in the Magellanic Clouds (MCs) arriving near their observed locations and velocities at the current time. After running ~8,000 simulations, our best matching model includes two close interactions between the MCs (940 Myr and 140 Myr ago) and reproduces some observed features of the MCs, including the LMC disc warp, a ring-shaped overdensity in the LMC, the tidal expansion of the SMC, and a greater distance dispersion on the eastern side of the SMC. The LMC disc warp is caused by the most recent interaction with the SMC, which occurred ~140 Myr before the present. The interaction causes global ripples in the LMC disc with a mean amplitude of 1.3 kpc.",

We adopt the standard realizability assumption: conditioned on the observed context, rewards and costs are drawn independently from fixed distributions whose expectations belong to known function classes. We consider the continuing setting, in which the algorithm operates over the entire horizon even after the budget is exhausted. In this setting, the objective is to simultaneously control regret and cumulative constraint violation. Building on the seminal SquareCB framework of Foster et al. (2018), we propose a simple and modular algorithmic scheme that leverages online regression oracles to reduce the constrained problem to a standard unconstrained contextual bandit problem with adaptively defined surrogate reward functions. In contrast to most prior work on CCB, which focuses on stochastic contexts, our reduction yields improved guarantees for the more general adversarial context setting, together with a compact and transparent analysis.",

To explore solutions, we generated nine AI agent concepts and evaluated them via a speed-dating survey with 116 US participants.

Our method is based on a Galerkin discretisation of the Lippmann-Schwinger volume integral equation, using a discontinuous piecewise-polynomial approximation space on a geometry-conforming mesh comprising elements which themselves have fractal boundary. We first provide a semi-discrete well-posedness and error analysis for both the $h$- and $p$-versions of our method for completely arbitrary inhomogeneities (without any regularity assumption on the boundary of the inhomogeneity or of the mesh elements). We prove convergence estimates for the integral equation solution and superconvergence estimates for linear functionals such as scattered field and far-field pattern evaluations, and elucidate how the regularity of the inhomogeneity boundary and the regularity of the refractive index affect the rates of convergence predicted. We then specialise to the case where the inhomogeneity is an ``$n$-attractor'', i.e.\\ the fractal attractor of an iterated function system satisfying the open set condition with non-empty interior, showing how in this case the self-similarity of the inhomogeneity can be used to generate geometry-conforming meshes. For the $h$-version with piecewise constant approximation we also present singular quadrature rules, supported by a fully discrete error analysis, permitting practical implementation of our method. We present numerical results for two-dimensional examples, which validate our theoretical results and show that our method is significantly more accurate than a comparable method involving replacement of the fractal inhomogeneity by a smoother prefractal approximation.",

      "abstract": "Reward guidance has been applied to great success in the test-time adaptation of continuous diffusion models; it updates each denoising step using the gradients from a downstream reward model. We study reward guidance for discrete diffusion language models, where one cannot differentiate through the natural outputs of the model because they are discrete tokens. Existing approaches either replace these discrete tokens with continuous relaxations, or employ techniques like the straight-through estimator. In this work, we show the downsides of both these methods. The former degrades gradient feedback because the reward model has never been trained with continuous inputs. The latter involves incorrect optimization because the gradient evaluated at discrete tokens is used to update continuous logits. Our key innovation is to go beyond this tradeoff by introducing a novel mechanism called EntRGi: Entropy aware Reward Guidance that dynamically regulates the gradients from the reward model. By modulating the continuous relaxation using the model's confidence, our approach substantially improves reward guidance while providing reliable inputs to the reward model. We empirically validate our approach on a 7B-parameter diffusion language model across 3 diverse reward models and 3 multi-skill benchmarks, showing consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "Searches for late--time gravitational--wave echoes following compact binary mergers are often interpreted as probes of exotic near--horizon or horizonless physics. We show that a well--motivated class of ultraviolet--finite quantum gravity and modified gravity theories, those based on diffeomorphism--invariant, analytic, entire--function nonlocality, generically suppress observable echo signals. The suppression follows from Paley--Wiener bounds associated with the analyticity of the nonlocal regulator, which enforce exponential damping of high--frequency reflection amplitudes and smear sharp effective potentials in the black--hole interior. We demonstrate that for regular black holes with horizons, the standard ingoing boundary condition eliminates the cavity required for echoes, while for regular horizonless compact objects the nonlocal kernel strongly attenuates both inner and photon--sphere reflections. As a result, repeated reflections during the ringdown phase are exponentially suppressed in frequency space and washed out in the time domain. Our results imply that the absence of echoes in current gravitational--wave data is consistent with covariant nonlocal gravity theories and does not, by itself, favor classical horizons over regular or horizonless ultraviolet completions. The analyticity and Paley--Wiener bounds that enforce echo suppression are required to ensure unitarity, ghost freedom, and ultraviolet finiteness of the underlying quantum theory. As a result, the classical ringdown phenomenology already encodes quantum--gravity consistency conditions. We emphasize that the absence of echoes in such theories does not rely on quantum decoherence or stochastic effects, but instead reflects the analytic structure imposed by quantum gravity on the classical limit.",

      "abstract": "Urban searches demand rapid, defensible decisions and sustained physical effort under high cognitive and situational load. Incident commanders must plan, coordinate, and document time-critical operations, while field searchers execute evolving tasks in uncertain environments. With recent advances in technology, ground-robot fleets paired with computer-vision-based situational awareness and LLM-powered interfaces offer the potential to ease these operational burdens. However, no dedicated studies have examined how public safety professionals perceive such technologies or envision their integration into existing practices, risking building technically sophisticated yet impractical solutions. To address this gap, we conducted focus-group sessions with eight police officers across five local departments in Virginia. Our findings show that ground robots could reduce professionals' reliance on paper references, mental calculations, and ad-hoc coordination, alleviating cognitive and physical strain in four key challenge areas: (1) partitioning the workforce across multiple search hypotheses, (2) retaining group awareness and situational awareness, (3) building route planning that fits the lost-person profile, and (4) managing cognitive and physical fatigue under uncertainty. We further identify four design opportunities and requirements for future ground-robot fleet integration in public-safety operations: (1) scalable multi-robot planning and control interfaces, (2) agency-specific route optimization, (3) real-time replanning informed by debrief updates, and (4) vision-assisted cueing that preserves operational trust while reducing cognitive workload. We conclude with design implications for deployable, accountable, and human-centered urban-search support systems",

      "abstract": "We propose a new and simplified multiscale time integrator Fourier pseudospectral (MTI-FP) method for the nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation (NKGE) with a dimensionless parameter epsilon in (0,1] inversely proportional to the speed of light, and establish its uniform first-order accuracy in time in the nonrelativistic regime, i.e. 0 < epsilon << 1. In this regime, the solution of the NKGE is highly oscillatory in time with O(epsilon^2)-wavelength, which brings significant difficulties in designing uniformly accurate numerical methods. The MTI-FP is based on (i) a multiscale decomposition by frequency of the NKGE in each time interval with simplified transmission conditions, and (ii) an exponential wave integrator for temporal discretization and a Fourier pseudospectral method for spatial discretization. By adapting the energy method and the mathematical induction, we obtain two error bounds in H1-norm at O(h^{m0}+tau^2/epsilon^2) and O(h^{m0}+tau+epsilon^2) with mesh size h, time step tau and m0 an integer dependent on the regularity of the solution, which immediately implies a uniformly accurate error bound O(h^{m0}+tau) with respect to epsilon in (0,1]. In addition, by adopting a linear interpolation of the micro variables with the multiscale decomposition in each time interval, we obtain a uniformly accurate numerical solution for any time t larger than zero. Thus the proposed MTI-FP method has a super resolution property in time in terms of the Shannon sampling theory, i.e. accurate numerical solutions can be obtained even when the time step is much bigger than the O(epsilon^2)-wavelength. Extensive numerical results are reported to confirm our error bounds and demonstrate their super resolution in time. Finally the proposed MTI-FP method is applied to study numerically convergence rates of the NKGE to its different limiting models in the nonrelativistic regime.",

The k-VCP is an important problem in network optimization, with applications in infrastructure protection and epidemic containment. We present a new extended integer linear programming (ILP) formulation that unifies and strengthens existing models and serves as the foundation for a new branch-and-price algorithm for the k-VCP. An in-depth theoretical study enables us to devise algorithmic components such as tailored branching rules that preserve the structure of the pricing problems, as well as valid inequalities and symmetry-handling techniques. We also show that our new model dominates all previous ILP formulations of the k-VCP in terms of their linear relaxations, which theoretically justifies the computational effectiveness of our approach. Extensive computational experiments against state-of-the-art methods demonstrate substantially improved performance, both in terms of instances solved to proven optimality and running times. On the full benchmark of 608 instances, our algorithm consistently outperforms all competitors and is able to solve 73 previously unsolved instances within the time limit of one hour.",

To constrain model parameters, we use the most recent publicly available observational data of the S2 star orbit, namely astrometric measurements, spectroscopic data, and the pericentre advance measured by the GRAVITY Collaboration. We further perform a consistent Bayesian comparison of models, calculating the log-Bayes factor of each space-time with respect to the Schwarzschild solution. Our results show that the currently available data indicate no statistically significant preference among the space-times considered. The Bardeen and Yukawa-like models are indistinguishable from Schwarzschild within current uncertainties, while the Reissner-Nordström, Janis-Newman-Winicour, Horndeski and Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton geometries show at most weak and non-decisive strength of evidence under the adopted priors and likelihood choices.",

Our implementation combines this HOD formulation with an IA model, enabling end-to-end automatic differentiation from HOD and IA parameters through to the galaxy field. We additionally extend this framework to differentiably model two-point correlation functions, including galaxy clustering and IA statistics. We validate diffHOD-IA against the reference halotools-IA implementation using the Bolshoi-Planck simulation, demonstrating excellent agreement across both one-point and two-point statistics. We verify the accuracy of gradients computed via automatic differentiation by comparison with finite-difference estimates for both HOD and IA parameters. We present science use cases leveraging gradients in the simulations to recover the IA parameters of a galaxy field representative of the TNG300 simulation. Finally, we apply diffHOD-IA in a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo analysis and compare its performance with halotools-IA and a neural-network-based emulator, IAEmu. Unlike emulator-based approaches, diffHOD-IA provides differentiability at the catalog level, enabling integration into field-level inference pipelines and extension to arbitrary summary statistics for next-generation weak-lensing analyses.

      "abstract": "In recent years there have been growing concerns about the proper evaluation of physical properties of superconductors, in particular for quantities extracted from magnetic characterizations. Errors can and often do occur due to the following issues: i) several measurement instruments still use Gaussian & cgs-emu units instead of the preferable International System (SI) units; ii) there are decades of valuable publications where, however, equations were expressed in Gaussian & cgs-emu or other unit systems or where constants were normalized to unity, which requires proper understanding and unit conversion in order to correctly evaluate the measured physical quantities; iii) the conversion between unit systems sometimes appears challenging and may not be properly performed. In this paper we will describe how to properly convert physical quantities relevant for the evaluation of magnetic and other properties focusing on the still most used unit systems, SI and Gaussian & cgs-emu. We will provide examples of how to properly verify and understand the physical formulae. We will include examples for the correct method to determine the critical current density Jc of a superconductor from the measurement of its magnetic hysteresis loop through the Bean model, and the correct conversion to SI of the equations for Hc2(T) according to the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) formulation. The goals of this paper are to make the readers aware of the unit conversion issue, to provide useful hands-on tools for proper conversion and to strongly encourage future exclusive use of the SI units and formulae.",

We first revisit Kalman filtering with conventional over-the-air (OTA) aggregation and highlight its transmit power limitations. To balance power efficiency and estimation performance, we formulate the scheduling task as a finite-horizon dynamic programming (DP) problem. By analyzing the structure of the optimal Q-function, we show that the resulting scheduling policy exhibits a semantic structure that adapts online to the estimation error covariance and channel variations. To obtain a practical solution, we derive a tractable upper bound on the Q-function via a positive semidefinite (PSD) cone decomposition, which enables an efficient approximate scheduling policy and a low-complexity remote estimation algorithm. Numerical results confirm that the proposed scheme outperforms existing methods in both estimation accuracy and power efficiency.",

In this study, we design a neural network to classify the spectral type of white dwarfs using a combination of spectra from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) data release~1 and imaging from Pan-STARRS photometry. The trained network has a near 100% accuracy at identifying DA and DB white dwarf spectral types, while having an 85-95% accuracy for identifying all other primary types, including metal pollution. Distinct spectral or photometric features map into separate structures when performing a Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) dimensionality reduction. Investigating further and looking at multiple epoch spectra, we performed a separate search for objects that have strongly changing spectral signatures using UMAP, discovering 3 new inhomogeneous surface composition ('double-faced') white dwarfs in the process. We lastly show how machine learning has the potential to separate single white dwarfs from double white dwarf binary star systems in a large dataset, ideal for isolating a single star population. The results from all of these techniques show a compelling use of machine learning to boost efficiency in analysing white dwarfs observed in multi-object spectroscopy surveys, at times replacing the need for human-driven spectral classifications. This demonstrates our techniques as powerful tools for batch population analyses, finding outliers as a form of rare subclass detection, and in conducting multi-epoch spectral analyses.",

      "abstract": "The distribution of dark matter in the inner regions of galaxies poses a key challenge for small-scale ΛCDM cosmology. While cold dark matter simulations predict cuspy inner density profiles, observations of low surface brightness (LSB) and dwarf galaxies often favour cored profiles, an issue known as the cusp-core problem. We investigate this problem by comparing four dark matter halo profiles: NFW (cuspy), Einasto (intermediate), Burkert (cored), and pseudo-isothermal (pISO) (cored) in a pilot sample of $11$ galaxies from the GMRT archive atomic gas survey (GARCIA). We have performed mass modelling using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques, utilising rotation curves derived from robust 3D Kinematic modelling. Baryonic contributions from stars derived using stellar kinematics based on $3.6μ\\mathrm{m}$ or $r$-band photometry via Multi-Gaussian Expansion (MGE) combined with Jeans Anisotropic Model (JAM) and from gas, calculated directly from the gas surface density (HI + He) without assuming any predefined functional form, are included. Our mass modelling shows that all halo profiles provide statistically good fits, yielding consistent estimates of halo mass and stellar mass-to-light ratio. To validate our analysis, we examine the stellar-to-halo mass relation and find broad agreement with empirical models. Non-parametric density profiles derived from baryon-subtracted rotation curves show that NFW fits the inner regions best, while all profiles converge in the outskirts. Future studies with a larger sample from GARCIA will be helpful in refining this trend and addressing the cusp-core issue in greater depth.",

Here, we propose a feasible cold-atom quantum simulator of a $(2+1)$-dimensional U$(1)$ lattice gauge theory in a spin $S=1$ truncation, featuring dynamical matter and gauge fields. We derive a mapping of this theory onto a bosonic computational basis, stabilized by an emergent gauge-protection mechanism through quantum Zeno dynamics. The implementation is based on a single-species Bose--Hubbard model realized in a tilted optical superlattice. This approach requires only moderate experimental resources already available in current ultracold-atom platforms. Using infinite matrix product state simulations, we benchmark real-time dynamics under global quenches. The results demonstrate faithful evolution of the target gauge theory and robust preservation of the gauge constraints. Our work significantly advances the experimental prospects for simulating higher-dimensional lattice gauge theories using larger gauge-field truncations.",

      "abstract": "We report the discovery of a generalized Luther-Emery liquid phase characterized by incommensurate pair-density-wave (iC-PDW) correlations in the two-leg $t$-$J$-$J_\\perp$ ladder model. By tuning the potential difference between the legs, we explore the regime of intermediate layer polarization $P$. Combining density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations with bosonization analysis, we identify a spin-gapped phase at finite $P$, where the interlayer and intralayer pair correlations both oscillate, but with distinct periodicities. The interlayer correlations exhibit FFLO-like oscillations, driven by pairing between layers with mismatched Fermi momenta, with a period determined by their momentum difference. In contrast, the intralayer pair correlations arise from the coupling between charges on one layer and spin fluctuations on the opposite layer, with a momentum equal to twice the Fermi momentum of the opposite layer. The iC-PDW state is robust across a wide range of doping and polarization, although finite interlayer hopping eventually destabilizes it toward a state with charge-$4e$ correlations. We conclude by discussing the experimental realization of this model in optical lattice platforms and its relevance to the bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.",

      "abstract": "Tidal interaction is a unique, detectable signature in gravitational wave signals from inspiraling binary neutron stars (BNSs), which can be used to constrain the neutron star (NS) equation of state (EoS). The tidal interaction is resonantly amplified as the orbital frequency approaches the NS fundamental mode (f-mode) frequency. It has been shown that the exclusion of tidal resonance in parameter estimation leads to a significant bias in the inferred NS tidal deformability and hence the NS EoS [Pratten et al. PRL 129, 081102 (2022)]. The strength and location of tidal resonance depend sensitively on the f-mode frequency, which is typically modeled using its universal relation with the tidal deformability that is derived for an isolated, non-spinning NS assuming only linear fluid perturbations. In a BNS inspiral, the f-mode frequency can be corrected by at least three known effects: nonlinear hydrodynamics, background spin, and relativity. We use Hamiltonian Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the systematic bias on tidal deformability when each frequency correction is ignored. Our study considers both loud, individual events and the stacking of a population of detections. Both scenarios are expected when the next-generation detectors are available with a sensitivity level increased by about an order of magnitude.",

      "abstract": "Measuring the mass distribution of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) over cosmic time remains particularly challenging for the low mass ($M_{\\bullet}\\lesssim10^8~M_\\odot$) population at $z>1$. This population is also the most sensitive to SMBH seeding and early growth models. In this work we construct a semi-empirical model for the redshift evolution of the TDE rate under multiple SMBH mass function prescriptions, and show that the observed redshift-dependent rate of TDEs is very sensitive to the SMBH mass function and its evolution with redshift. We further incorporate galaxy-scale processes that evolve with redshift -- namely, increasing galaxy nuclear stellar densities, enhanced galaxy-galaxy merger rates, dust obscuration, and a possible top-heavy IMF at early cosmic times -- and quantify their combined impact on the TDE rate. We find that including these effects generally results in a volumetric TDE rate that increases with redshift until a maximum near cosmic noon, before declining at higher redshift where SMBHs that can disrupt stars become increasingly scarce. We forecast TDE rates in the Rubin LSST and the Roman High Latitude Time Domain Survey, alongside expectations for serendipitous TDE rates in the JWST COSMOS-Web survey. Finally, we provide a methodology for using a flux-limited survey of TDEs in LSST to directly constrain the redshift evolution of the SMBH mass function.",

By shifting optimization from what to generate to where to attend, RAL promotes effective information allocation and improved grounding in complex multimodal inputs. Experiments across diverse image and video benchmarks show consistent gains over GRPO and other baselines.

Existing proxy metrics focus on the representation's capacity to capture narrow aspects of the visual world, like object shape, limiting generalization across environments. In this paper, we take an analytical perspective: we probe pretrained visual encoders by measuring how well they support decoding of environment state -- including geometry, object structure, and physical attributes -- from images. Leveraging simulation environments with access to ground-truth state, we show that this probing accuracy strongly correlates with downstream policy performance across diverse environments and learning settings, significantly outperforming prior metrics and enabling efficient representation selection. More broadly, our study provides insight into the representational properties that support generalizable manipulation, suggesting that learning to encode the latent physical state of the environment is a promising objective for control.",

      "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a cornerstone for fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs), with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) serving as the de facto standard algorithm. Despite its ubiquity, we argue that the core ratio clipping mechanism in PPO is structurally ill-suited for the large vocabularies inherent to LLMs. PPO constrains policy updates based on the probability ratio of sampled tokens, which serves as a noisy single-sample Monte Carlo estimate of the true policy divergence. This creates a sub-optimal learning dynamic: updates to low-probability tokens are aggressively over-penalized, while potentially catastrophic shifts in high-probability tokens are under-constrained, leading to training inefficiency and instability. To address this, we propose Divergence Proximal Policy Optimization (DPPO), which substitutes heuristic clipping with a more principled constraint based on a direct estimate of policy divergence (e.g., Total Variation or KL). To avoid huge memory footprint, we introduce the efficient Binary and Top-K approximations to capture the essential divergence with negligible overhead. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that DPPO achieves superior training stability and efficiency compared to existing methods, offering a more robust foundation for RL-based LLM fine-tuning.",

In this paper, we propose \\method, a novel dense point tracker that eschews cost volumes in favor of warping. Inspired by recent advances in optical flow, our approach iteratively refines track estimates by warping features from the target frame to the query frame based on the current estimate. Combined with a transformer architecture that performs joint spatiotemporal reasoning across all tracks, our design establishes long-range correspondences without computing feature correlations. Our model is simple and achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard dense point tracking benchmarks, including TAP-Vid-DAVIS, TAP-Vid-Kinetics, and Robo-TAP. Remarkably, the model also excels at optical flow, sometimes outperforming specialized methods on the Sintel, KITTI, and Spring benchmarks. These results suggest that warping-based architectures can unify dense point tracking and optical flow estimation.",

PerpetualWonder solves this by introducing the first true closed-loop system. It features a novel unified representation that creates a bidirectional link between the physical state and visual primitives, allowing generative refinements to correct both the dynamics and appearance. It also introduces a robust update mechanism that gathers supervision from multiple viewpoints to resolve optimization ambiguity.

However, existing results focus exclusively on unimodal data; in contrast, the theoretical underpinnings of in-context learning for multi-modal data remain poorly understood. We introduce a mathematically tractable framework for studying multi-modal learning and explore when transformer-like architectures can recover Bayes-optimal performance in-context. To model multi-modal problems, we assume the observed data arises from a latent factor model. Our first result comprises a negative take on expressibility: we prove that single-layer, linear self-attention fails to recover the Bayes-optimal predictor uniformly over the task distribution. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel, linearized cross-attention mechanism, which we study in the regime where both the number of cross-attention layers and the context length are large. We show that this cross-attention mechanism is provably Bayes optimal when optimized using gradient flow. Our results underscore the benefits of depth for in-context learning and establish the provable utility of cross-attention for multi-modal distributions.",

Using Scopus article, the study analyses Relative Intensity of Collaboration (RIC) among EU member state, candidate countries and China, Latin America, the UK, the USA and Russia. Findings indicate increasing integration within European groups and with global partners, yet persistent hierarchical structures remain. EU-14 countries form the core of the network, exhibiting stable and cohesive collaboration, including with the UK despite Brexit. EU-13 countries occupy an intermediate position, showing moderate collaboration with EU-14 but stronger collaboration within their own group, with EU candidate countries and Russia. EU candidate countries demonstrate even weaker integration with EU-14, focusing on intra-group ties and links with EU-13 and Russia. RIC peaks in 2012 and 2018 for EU-13 and EU candidate countries correspond to Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe cycles, highlighting the role of EU Framework Programmes. Collaboration with Russia increased following 2014 and only marginally declined after 2022. For EU-14, it exceeds collaboration with the USA. Collaboration with China remains limited due to network and cultural constraints, with similar intensity across all three groups.

In this work, we introduce a novel benchmark suite for CRL based on realistically simulated robots in the Gazebo simulator. Our Continual Robotic Simulation Suite (CRoSS) benchmarks rely on two robotic platforms: a two-wheeled differential-drive robot with lidar, camera and bumper sensor, and a robotic arm with seven joints. The former represent an agent in line-following and object-pushing scenarios, where variation of visual and structural parameters yields a large number of distinct tasks, whereas the latter is used in two goal-reaching scenarios with high-level cartesian hand position control (modeled after the Continual World benchmark), and low-level control based on joint angles. For the robotic arm benchmarks, we provide additional kinematics-only variants that bypass the need for physical simulation (as long as no sensor readings are required), and which can be run two orders of magnitude faster. CRoSS is designed to be easily extensible and enables controlled studies of continual reinforcement learning in robotic settings with high physical realism, and in particular allow the use of almost arbitrary simulated sensors. To ensure reproducibility and ease of use, we provide a containerized setup (Apptainer) that runs out-of-the-box, and report performances of standard RL algorithms, including Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and policy gradient methods.

Existing evaluations, such as microcanonical molecular dynamics (MD), are computationally expensive and primarily probe near-equilibrium states. To improve evaluation metrics for MLIPs, we introduce the Bond Smoothness Characterization Test (BSCT). This efficient benchmark probes the PES via controlled bond deformations and detects non-smoothness, including discontinuities, artificial minima, and spurious forces, both near and far from equilibrium. We show that BSCT correlates strongly with MD stability while requiring a fraction of the cost of MD. To demonstrate how BSCT can guide iterative model design, we utilize an unconstrained Transformer backbone as a testbed, illustrating how refinements such as a new differentiable $k$-nearest neighbors algorithm and temperature-controlled attention reduce artifacts identified by our metric. By optimizing model design systematically based on BSCT, the resulting MLIP simultaneously achieves a low conventional E/F regression error, stable MD simulations, and robust atomistic property predictions. Our results establish BSCT as both a validation metric and as an \"in-the-loop\" model design proxy that alerts MLIP developers to physical challenges that cannot be efficiently evaluated by current MLIP benchmarks.",

However, transferring capabilities learned with PI to policies that must act without it at inference time remains a fundamental challenge. We study this problem in the context of distilling frontier models for multi-turn agentic environments, where closed-source systems typically hide their internal reasoning and expose only action trajectories. This breaks standard distillation pipelines, since successful behavior is observable but the reasoning process is not. For this, we introduce π-Distill, a joint teacher-student objective that trains a PI-conditioned teacher and an unconditioned student simultaneously using the same model. Additionally, we also introduce On-Policy Self-Distillation (OPSD), an alternative approach that trains using Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a reverse KL-penalty between the student and the PI-conditioned teacher. We show that both of these algorithms effectively distill frontier agents using action-only PI. Specifically we find that π-Distill and in some cases OPSD, outperform industry standard practices (Supervised finetuning followed by RL) that assume access to full Chain-of-Thought supervision across multiple agentic benchmarks, models, and forms of PI. We complement our results with extensive analysis that characterizes the factors enabling effective learning with PI, focusing primarily on π-Distill and characterizing when OPSD is competitive.",

      "title": "Improving Set Function Approximation with Quasi-Arithmetic Neural Networks",
      "abstract": "Sets represent a fundamental abstraction across many types of data. To handle the unordered nature of set-structured data, models such as DeepSets and PointNet rely on fixed, non-learnable pooling operations (e.g., sum or max) -- a design choice that can hinder the transferability of learned embeddings and limits model expressivity. More recently, learnable aggregation functions have been proposed as more expressive alternatives. In this work, we advance this line of research by introducing the Neuralized Kolmogorov Mean (NKM) -- a novel, trainable framework for learning a generalized measure of central tendency through an invertible neural function. We further propose quasi-arithmetic neural networks (QUANNs), which incorporate the NKM as a learnable aggregation function. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that, QUANNs are universal approximators for a broad class of common set-function decompositions and, thanks to their invertible neural components, learn more structured latent representations. Empirically, QUANNs outperform state-of-the-art baselines across diverse benchmarks, while learning embeddings that transfer effectively even to tasks that do not involve sets.",

      "abstract": "Reasoning language models, which generate long chains of thought, dramatically outperform non-reasoning language models on abstract problems. However, the internal model mechanisms that allow this superior performance remain poorly understood. We present a mechanistic analysis of how QwQ-32B - a model specifically trained to produce extensive reasoning traces - process abstract structural information. On Mystery Blocksworld - a semantically obfuscated planning domain - we find that QwQ-32B gradually improves its internal representation of actions and concepts during reasoning. The model develops abstract encodings that focus on structure rather than specific action names. Through steering experiments, we establish causal evidence that these adaptations improve problem solving: injecting refined representations from successful traces boosts accuracy, while symbolic representations can replace many obfuscated encodings with minimal performance loss. We find that one of the factors driving reasoning model performance is in-context refinement of token representations, which we dub Fluid Reasoning Representations.",

      "abstract": "Open-ended self-improving agents can autonomously modify their own structural designs to advance their capabilities and overcome the limits of pre-defined architectures, thus reducing reliance on human intervention. We introduce Group-Evolving Agents (GEA), a new paradigm for open-ended self-improvements, which treats a group of agents as the fundamental evolutionary unit, enabling explicit experience sharing and reuse within the group throughout evolution. Unlike existing open-ended self-evolving paradigms that adopt tree-structured evolution, GEA overcomes the limitation of inefficient utilization of exploratory diversity caused by isolated evolutionary branches. We evaluate GEA on challenging coding benchmarks, where it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art self-evolving methods (71.0% vs. 56.7% on SWE-bench Verified, 88.3% vs. 68.3% on Polyglot) and matches or exceeds top human-designed agent frameworks (71.8% and 52.0% on two benchmarks, respectively). Analysis reveals that GEA more effectively converts early-stage exploratory diversity into sustained, long-term progress, achieving stronger performance under the same number of evolved agents. Furthermore, GEA exhibits consistent transferability across different coding models and greater robustness, fixing framework-level bugs in 1.4 iterations on average, versus 5 for self-evolving methods.",

However, these imagers generally suffer from poor reconstruction quality. Here, we describe several advances in both hardware and software that result in improved lensless imaging quality. First, we use a precision-manufactured random multi-focal lenslet (RML) phase mask to produce improved measurements with reduced multiplexing. Next, we implement a ConvNeXt-based reconstruction architecture, which provides up to 6.68 dB improvement in peak signal-to-noise ratio over state-of-the-art attention-based architectures. Finally, we establish a parallel imaging setup that simultaneously images a scene with RML, diffuser and lens systems, with which we collect datasets with 100,000 measurements for each system, to be used for reconstruction model training and evaluation. Using this standardized system, we quantify the improved measurement quality of the RML compared to a diffuser using the modulation transfer function and mutual information. Our ConvRML system benefits from both the optical and the computational developments presented in this work, and our contributions establish resources to support continued development of high-quality, compact, and compressive lensless imagers.",

We emphasize the role of combinatorics in the study of continuous eigenvalues through the interplay between coboundaries and extension graphs, and we give several types of sufficient conditions for the nonexistence of trivial letter-coboundaries. As further results, we apply coboundaries in the context of bounded discrepancy, and in particular we obtain a simple characterization of letter-balance for primitive substitutive subshifts. Moreover, we recover a result of Tijdeman on the minimal factor complexity of transitive subshifts with rationally independent letter frequencies. Finally, we use linear-algebraic duality to refine known descriptions of the possible values of eigenvalues in terms of measures of bases.",

One of the important unexplained phenomena is why and how, during the process of training with gradient descent, the theoretical capacity of neural networks is reduced to an effective capacity that fits the task. We here investigate the mechanism by which gradient descent achieves this through analyzing the learning dynamics at the level of individual neurons in single hidden layer ReLU networks. We identify three dynamical principles -- mutual alignment, unlocking and racing -- that together explain why we can often successfully reduce capacity after training through the merging of equivalent neurons or the pruning of low norm weights. We specifically explain the mechanism behind the lottery ticket conjecture, or why the specific, beneficial initial conditions of some neurons lead them to obtain higher weight norms.",

      "abstract": "Dual connectivity (DC) has garnered significant attention in 5G evolution, allowing for enhancing throughput and reliability by leveraging the channel conditions of two paths. However, when the paths exhibit different delays, such as in terrestrial and non-terrestrial integrated networks with multi-orbit topologies or in networks characterized by frequent topology changes, like Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellations with different elevation angles, traffic delivery may experience packet reordering or triggering congestion control mechanisms. Additionally, real-time traffic may experience packet drops if their arrival exceeds a play-out threshold. Different techniques have been proposed to address these issues, such as packet duplication, packet switching, and network coding for traffic scheduling in DC. However, if not accurately designed, these techniques can lead to resource waste, encoding/decoding delays, and computational overhead, undermining DC's intended benefits. This paper provides a mathematical framework for calculating the average end-to-end packet loss in case of a loss process modeled with a Discrete Markov Chain - typical of a wireless channel - when combining packet duplication and packet switching or when network coding is employed in DC. Such metrics help derive optimal policies with full knowledge of the underlying loss process to be compared to empirical models learned through Machine Learning algorithms.",

It is hypothesized that this is because developers use type annotations as in-code documentation. In this study, we aim to provide evidence that developers use type annotations as in-code documentation. Understanding this hypothesized use will help to understand how, and in what contexts, developers use type information; additionally, it may help to design better development tools and inform educational decisions. To provide this evidence, we conduct an eye tracking study with 26 undergraduate students to determine if they read type annotations during code comprehension and bug localization in the TypeScript language. We found that developers do not look directly at lines containing type annotations or type declarations more often when they are present, in either code summarization or bug localization tasks. The results have implications for tool builders to improve the availability of type information, the development community to build good standards for use of type annotations, and education to enforce deliberate teaching of reading patterns.",

In this work, we propose XtraLight-MedMamba, an ultra-lightweight state-space-based deep learning framework for classifying neoplastic tubular adenomas from whole-slide images (WSIs). The architecture is a blend of ConvNext based shallow feature extractor with parallel vision mamba to efficiently model both long- and short-range dependencies and image generalization. An integration of Spatial and Channel Attention Bridge (SCAB) module enhances multiscale feature extraction, while Fixed Non-Negative Orthogonal Classifier (FNOClassifier) enables substantial parameter reduction and improved generalization. The model was evaluated on a curated dataset acquired from patients with low-grade tubular adenomas, stratified into case and control cohorts based on subsequent CRC development. XtraLight-MedMamba achieved an accuracy of 97.18% and an F1-score of 0.9767 using approximately 32,000 parameters, outperforming transformer-based and conventional Mamba architectures with significantly higher model complexity.",

      "abstract": "Recent years have seen an explosion of interest in autonomous cyber defence agents trained to defend computer networks using deep reinforcement learning. These agents are typically trained in cyber gym environments using dense, highly engineered reward functions which combine many penalties and incentives for a range of (un)desirable states and costly actions. Dense rewards help alleviate the challenge of exploring complex environments but risk biasing agents towards suboptimal and potentially riskier solutions, a critical issue in complex cyber environments. We thoroughly evaluate the impact of reward function structure on learning and policy behavioural characteristics using a variety of sparse and dense reward functions, two well-established cyber gyms, a range of network sizes, and both policy gradient and value-based RL algorithms. Our evaluation is enabled by a novel ground truth evaluation approach which allows directly comparing between different reward functions, illuminating the nuanced inter-relationships between rewards, action space and the risks of suboptimal policies in cyber environments. Our results show that sparse rewards, provided they are goal aligned and can be encountered frequently, uniquely offer both enhanced training reliability and more effective cyber defence agents with lower-risk policies. Surprisingly, sparse rewards can also yield policies that are better aligned with cyber defender goals and make sparing use of costly defensive actions without explicit reward-based numerical penalties.",

Inspired by biological systems, the framework uses a two-level architecture: evolutionary optimization (outer loop) discovers afferent sensing architectures that enable effective policy learning, while reinforcement learning (inner loop) trains damage-avoidance policies using these signals. This formalizes afferent sensing as providing an inductive bias for efficient learning: architectures are selected based on their ability to enable effective learning (rather than directly minimizing damage). We provide theoretical convergence guarantees under smoothness and bounded-noise assumptions. We illustrate the general approach in the challenging context of biomechanical digital twins operating over long time horizons (multiple decades of the life-course). Here, we find that CAT-based evolved architectures achieve significantly higher efficiency and better age-robustness than hand-designed baselines, enabling policies that exhibit age-dependent behavioral adaptation (23% reduction in high-risk actions). Ablation studies validate CAT signals, evolution, and predictive discrepancy as essential. We release code and data for reproducibility.",

      "abstract": "The rapid proliferation of generative 3D models has created a critical bottleneck in animation pipelines: rigging. Existing automated methods are fundamentally limited by their approach to skinning, treating it as an ill-posed, high-dimensional regression task that is inefficient to optimize and is typically decoupled from skeleton generation. We posit this is a representation problem and introduce SkinTokens: a learned, compact, and discrete representation for skinning weights. By leveraging an FSQ-CVAE to capture the intrinsic sparsity of skinning, we reframe the task from continuous regression to a more tractable token sequence prediction problem. This representation enables TokenRig, a unified autoregressive framework that models the entire rig as a single sequence of skeletal parameters and SkinTokens, learning the complicated dependencies between skeletons and skin deformations. The unified model is then amenable to a reinforcement learning stage, where tailored geometric and semantic rewards improve generalization to complex, out-of-distribution assets. Quantitatively, the SkinTokens representation leads to a 98%-133% percents improvement in skinning accuracy over state-of-the-art methods, while the full TokenRig framework, refined with RL, enhances bone prediction by 17%-22%. Our work presents a unified, generative approach to rigging that yields higher fidelity and robustness, offering a scalable solution to a long-standing challenge in 3D content creation.",

      "abstract": "Multi-Agent Aerial Load Transport Systems (MAATS) offer greater payload capacity and fault tolerance than single-drone solutions. However, they have an underdetermined tension allocation problem that leads to uneven energy distribution, cable slack, or collisions between drones and cables. This paper presents a real-time optimization layer that improves a hierarchical load-position-attitude controller by incorporating a Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) algorithm. The SQP formulation minimizes the sum of squared cable tensions while imposing a cable-alignment penalty that discourages small inter-cable angles, thereby preventing tether convergence without altering the reference trajectory. We tested the method under nominal conditions by running numerical simulations of four quadrotors. Computational experiments based on numerical simulations demonstrate that the SQP routine runs in a few milliseconds on standard hardware, indicating feasibility for real-time use. A sensitivity analysis confirms that the gain of the cable-alignment penalty can be tuned online, enabling a controllable trade-off between safety margin and energy consumption with no measurable degradation of tracking performance in simulation. This framework provides a scalable path to safe and energy-balanced cooperative load transport in practical deployments.",

      "abstract": "Extant literature on fair pricing methods for actuarial contexts has primarily focused on the regression setting. While such approaches are well-suited to short-term products, it is unclear how they generalize to long-term products, whose pricing essentially relies on estimating transition rates in multi-state models. To address this gap, we propose a unified framework that recasts the estimation of any given multi-state transition model as a set of Poisson regression problems. This reformulation enables the direct application of existing fair pricing methods, which together constitute our proposed methodology. As an illustration, we apply the framework to a fair pricing exercise for a stylized long-term care insurance product using data from the University of Michigan Health and Retirement Study (HRS), focusing on a post-processing approach. We further explain how the framework readily accommodates pre-processing and in-processing fairness methods.",

Limited by the scarcity of observations, tabular datasets often exhibit critical deficiencies, such as class imbalance, selection bias, and low fidelity. To address these challenges, building on recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), this paper introduces Team-then-Trim (T$^2$), a framework that synthesizes high-quality tabular data through a collaborative team of LLMs, followed by a rigorous three-stage plug-in data quality control (QC) pipeline. In T$^2$, tabular data generation is conceptualized as a manufacturing process: specialized LLMs, guided by domain knowledge, are tasked with generating different data components sequentially, and the resulting products, i.e., the synthetic data, are systematically evaluated across multiple dimensions of QC. Empirical results on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that T$^2$ outperforms state-of-the-art methods in producing high-quality tabular data, highlighting its potential to support downstream models when direct data collection is practically infeasible.",

Here, we present a theoretical framework for coupled diffusion models, using coupled Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes as a tractable model. By using the nonequilibrium statistical physics of dynamical phase transitions, we demonstrate that multimodal generation is governed by a spectral hierarchy of interaction timescales rather than simultaneous resolution. A key prediction is the ``synchronization gap'', a temporal window during the reverse generative process where distinct eigenmodes stabilize at different rates, providing a theoretical explanation for common desynchronization artifacts. We derive analytical conditions for speciation and collapse times under both symmetric and anisotropic coupling regimes, establishing strict bounds for coupling strength to avoid unstable symmetry breaking. We show that the coupling strength acts as a spectral filter that enforces a tunable temporal hierarchy on generation. We support these predictions through controlled experiments with diffusion models trained on MNIST datasets and exact score samplers. These results motivate time dependent coupling schedules that target mode specific timescales, offering a potential alternative to ad hoc guidance tuning.",

      "abstract": "Setting the learning rate for a deep learning model is a critical part of successful training, yet choosing this hyperparameter is often done empirically with trial and error. In this work, we explore a solvable model of optimal learning rate schedules for a powerlaw random feature model trained with stochastic gradient descent (SGD). We consider the optimal schedule $η_T^\\star(t)$ where $t$ is the current iterate and $T$ is the total training horizon. This schedule is computed both numerically and analytically (when possible) using optimal control methods. Our analysis reveals two regimes which we term the easy phase and hard phase. In the easy phase the optimal schedule is a polynomial decay $η_T^\\star(t) \\simeq T^{-ξ} (1-t/T)^δ$ where $ξ$ and $δ$ depend on the properties of the features and task. In the hard phase, the optimal schedule resembles warmup-stable-decay with constant (in $T$) initial learning rate and annealing performed over a vanishing (in $T$) fraction of training steps. We investigate joint optimization of learning rate and batch size, identifying a degenerate optimality condition. Our model also predicts the compute-optimal scaling laws (where model size and training steps are chosen optimally) in both easy and hard regimes. Going beyond SGD, we consider optimal schedules for the momentum $β(t)$, where speedups in the hard phase are possible. We compare our optimal schedule to various benchmarks in our task including (1) optimal constant learning rates $η_T(t) \\sim T^{-ξ}$ (2) optimal power laws $η_T(t) \\sim T^{-ξ} t^{-χ}$, finding that our schedule achieves better rates than either of these. Our theory suggests that learning rate transfer across training horizon depends on the structure of the model and task. We explore these ideas in simple experimental pretraining setups.",

In this work, we present Graph Billion- Foundation-Fusion (GraphBFF): the first end-to-end recipe for building billion-parameter Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) for arbitrary heterogeneous, billion-scale graphs. Central to the recipe is the GraphBFF Transformer, a flexible and scalable architecture designed for practical billion-scale GFMs. Using the GraphBFF, we present the first neural scaling laws for general graphs and show that loss decreases predictably as either model capacity or training data scales, depending on which factor is the bottleneck. The GraphBFF framework provides concrete methodologies for data batching, pretraining, and fine-tuning for building GFMs at scale. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework with an evaluation of a 1.4 billion-parameter GraphBFF Transformer pretrained on one billion samples. Across ten diverse, real-world downstream tasks on graphs unseen during training, spanning node- and link-level classification and regression, GraphBFF achieves remarkable zero-shot and probing performance, including in few-shot settings, with large margins of up to 31 PRAUC points. Finally, we discuss key challenges and open opportunities for making GFMs a practical and principled foundation for graph learning at industrial scale.",

We derive a dependence of the IRX on UV slope $β$, stellar mass $M_\\ast$, and redshift out to $z \\simeq 5$, and establish consistent functional relations that can be used for correcting the UV/optical-selected galaxy samples for the effects of dust absorption.   Methods. This work is based on a $K$-band selected sample of $\\sim 10^5$ star-forming galaxies detected in the UDS and COSMOS fields. Quiescent sources and known starbursts are removed, and the IR luminosities are established through stacking in FIR {\\it Herschel} and JCMT maps. UV slopes are found from SED fits and stacked IRX values are derived by taking the median of individual IRX measurements in bins of $β$, $M_\\ast$ and redshift.   Results. While our best-fit IRX-$β$ relation is consistent with a Calzetti-like attenuation curve at $β\\gtrsim -1$, at bluer values the IRX seems to increase with redshift due to different mass-completeness limits imposed. When deriving the IRX-$β$ relation in stellar-mass bins, a systematic trend is found, where the effective slope of the attenuation law becomes progressively shallower with increasing mass. We incorporate this into the IRX-$β$ relation through the slope of the underlying reddening law, $dA_{1600}/dβ$, being a quadratic function of $\\log(M_\\ast/{\\rm M_\\odot})$. Expressing IRX as a function of the stellar mass we find a tight correlation, with IRX rising monotonically with mass but exhibiting a clear high-mass turnover at $z\\lesssim 2-3$, consistent with suppressed cold-gas accretion and dust growth in massive systems.",

      "abstract": "Small and medium-sized islands are acutely exposed to climate change and ecosystem degradation, yet the extent to which uncertainty is systematically addressed in scientific assessments of their ecosystem services remains poorly understood. This study revisits 226 peer-reviewed articles drawn from two global systematic reviews on island ecosystem services and climate change, applying a structured post hoc analysis to evaluate how uncertainty is treated across methods, service categories, ecosystem realms, and decision contexts. Studies were classified according to whether uncertainty was explicitly analysed, just mentioned, or ignored. Only 30 percent of studies incorporated uncertainty explicitly, while more than half did not address it at all. Scenario-based approaches dominated uncertainty assessment, whereas probabilistic and ensemble-based frameworks remained limited. Cultural ecosystem services and extreme climate impacts exhibited the lowest levels of uncertainty integration, and few studies connected uncertainty treatment to policy relevant decision frameworks. Weak or absent treatment of uncertainty emerges as a structural challenge in island systems, where narrow ecological thresholds, strong land-sea coupling, limited spatial buffers, and reduced institutional redundancy amplify the consequences of decision-making under incomplete knowledge. Systematic mapping of how uncertainty is framed, operationalised, or neglected reveals persistent methodological and conceptual gaps and informs concrete directions for strengthening uncertainty integration in future island-focused ecosystem service and climate assessments. Embedding uncertainty more robustly into modelling practices, participatory processes, and policy tools is essential for enhancing scientific credibility, governance relevance, and adaptive capacity in insular socio-ecological systems.",

A prime example of this is plasma turbulence described by the gyrokinetic equations: nonlinear, multiscale, and 5D in phase space. It constitutes one of the most computationally demanding frontiers of modern science, with runs taking weeks and yielding tens of terabytes of data dumps. The increasing storage demands underscore the importance of compression. However, reconstructed snapshots do not necessarily preserve essential physical quantities. We present a spatiotemporal evaluation pipeline, accounting for structural phenomena and multi-scale transient fluctuations to assess the degree of physical fidelity. Indeed, we find that various compression techniques lack preservation of both spatial mode structure and temporal turbulence characteristics. Therefore, we explore Physics-Informed Neural Compression (PINC), which incorporates physics-informed losses tailored to gyrokinetics and enables extreme compressions ratios of over 70,000x. Entropy coding on top of PINC further pushes it to 120,000x.

      "abstract": "Multi-source precipitation products (MSPs) from satellite retrievals and reanalysis are widely used for hydroclimatic monitoring, yet spatially heterogeneous biases and limited skill for extremes still constrain their hydrologic utility. Here we develop a dual-stage TransUNet-based multi-source precipitation merging framework (DDL-MSPMF) that integrates six MSPs with four ERA5 near-surface physical predictors. A first-stage classifier estimates daily precipitation occurrence probability, and a second-stage regressor fuses the classifier outputs together with all predictors to estimate daily precipitation amount at 0.25 degree resolution over China for 2001-2020. Benchmarking against multiple deep learning and hybrid baselines shows that the TransUNet - TransUNet configuration yields the best seasonal performance (R = 0.75; RMSE = 2.70 mm/day) and improves robustness relative to a single-regressor setting. For heavy precipitation (>25 mm/day), DDL-MSPMF increases equitable threat scores across most regions of eastern China and better reproduces the spatial pattern of the July 2021 Zhengzhou rainstorm, indicating enhanced extreme-event detection beyond seasonal-mean corrections. Independent evaluation over the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau using TPHiPr further supports its applicability in data-scarce regions. SHAP analysis highlights the importance of precipitation occurrence probabilities and surface pressure, providing physically interpretable diagnostics. The proposed framework offers a scalable and explainable approach for precipitation fusion and extreme-event assessment.",

Combined with an amortized training strategy by learning on random subsets of original high-resolution meshes and a physical state caching technique during inference, Transolver-3 enables high-fidelity field prediction on industrial-scale meshes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Transolver-3 is capable of handling meshes with over 160 million cells, achieving impressive performance across three challenging simulation benchmarks, including aircraft and automotive design tasks.",

In this paper, we conducted two comprehensive studies to explore the perspectives of industry professionals and students on different AML vulnerabilities and their educational strategies. In our first study, we conducted an online survey with professionals revealing a notable correlation between cybersecurity education and concern for AML threats. For our second study, we developed two CTF challenges that implement Natural Language Processing and Generative AI concepts and demonstrate a poisoning attack on the training data set. The effectiveness of these challenges was evaluated by surveying undergraduate and graduate students at Carnegie Mellon University, finding that a CTF-based approach effectively engages interest in AML threats. Based on the responses of the participants in our research, we provide detailed recommendations emphasizing the critical need for integrated security education within the ML curriculum.",

Multiple imputation offers a principled solution for filling these gaps. This study evaluates the performance of several multiple imputation methods, both in the presence and absence of extreme values, using the MICE package in R. Through Monte Carlo simulations, we generated incomplete data sets with three variables and assessed each imputation method within regression models. The results indicate that the linear regression based imputation method showed the best overall predictive performance (CV-MSE), whereas the sparse model approach was generally less efficient. Our findings underscore the relevance of extreme values when selecting an imputation strategy and highlight sample size, proportion of missingness, presence of extremes, and the type of fitted model as key determinants of performance. Despite its limitations, the study offers practical recommendations for researchers, stressing the need to examine the missingness mechanism and the occurrence of extreme values before choosing an imputation method.",

      "abstract": "The landscape of synthetic media has been irrevocably altered by text-to-video (T2V) models, whose outputs are rapidly approaching indistinguishability from reality. Critically, this technology is no longer confined to large-scale labs; the proliferation of efficient, open-source generators is democratizing the ability to create high-fidelity synthetic content on consumer-grade hardware. This makes existing face-centric and manipulation-based benchmarks obsolete. To address this urgent threat, we introduce SynthForensics, to the best of our knowledge the first human-centric benchmark for detecting purely synthetic video deepfakes. The benchmark comprises 6,815 unique videos from five architecturally distinct, state-of-the-art open-source T2V models. Its construction was underpinned by a meticulous two-stage, human-in-the-loop validation to ensure high semantic and visual quality. Each video is provided in four versions (raw, lossless, light, and heavy compression) to enable real-world robustness testing. Experiments demonstrate that state-of-the-art detectors are both fragile and exhibit limited generalization when evaluated on this new domain: we observe a mean performance drop of $29.19\\%$ AUC, with some methods performing worse than random chance, and top models losing over 30 points under heavy compression. The paper further investigates the efficacy of training on SynthForensics as a means to mitigate these observed performance gaps, achieving robust generalization to unseen generators ($93.81\\%$ AUC), though at the cost of reduced backward compatibility with traditional manipulation-based deepfakes. The complete dataset and all generation metadata, including the specific prompts and inference parameters for every video, will be made publicly available at [link anonymized for review].",

      "abstract": "This paper proposes a suite of rationality measures and associated theory for reinforcement learning agents, a property increasingly critical yet rarely explored. We define an action in deployment to be perfectly rational if it maximises the hidden true value function in the steepest direction. The expected value discrepancy of a policy's actions against their rational counterparts, culminating over the trajectory in deployment, is defined to be expected rational risk; an empirical average version in training is also defined. Their difference, termed as rational risk gap, is decomposed into (1) an extrinsic component caused by environment shifts between training and deployment, and (2) an intrinsic one due to the algorithm's generalisability in a dynamic environment. They are upper bounded by, respectively, (1) the $1$-Wasserstein distance between transition kernels and initial state distributions in training and deployment, and (2) the empirical Rademacher complexity of the value function class. Our theory suggests hypotheses on the benefits from regularisers (including layer normalisation, $\\ell_2$ regularisation, and weight normalisation) and domain randomisation, as well as the harm from environment shifts. Experiments are in full agreement with these hypotheses. The code is available at https://github.com/EVIEHub/Rationality.",

To this end, we propose the Conditional Counterfactual Mean Embeddings (CCME), a framework that embeds conditional distributions of counterfactual outcomes into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). Under this framework, we develop a two-stage meta-estimator for CCME that accommodates any RKHS-valued regression in each stage. Based on this meta-estimator, we develop three practical CCME estimators: (1) Ridge Regression estimator, (2) Deep Feature estimator that parameterizes the feature map by a neural network, and (3) Neural-Kernel estimator that performs RKHS-valued regression, with the coefficients parameterized by a neural network. We provide finite-sample convergence rates for all estimators, establishing that they possess the double robustness property. Our experiments demonstrate that our estimators accurately recover distributional features including multimodal structure of conditional counterfactual distributions.",

      "abstract": "The design of materials with tailored properties is crucial for technological progress. However, most deep generative models focus exclusively on perfectly ordered crystals, neglecting the important class of disordered materials. To address this gap, we introduce DMFlow, a generative framework specifically designed for disordered crystals. Our approach introduces a unified representation for ordered, Substitutionally Disordered (SD), and Positionally Disordered (PD) crystals, and employs a flow matching model to jointly generate all structural components. A key innovation is a Riemannian flow matching framework with spherical reparameterization, which ensures physically valid disorder weights on the probability simplex. The vector field is learned by a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) that incorporates physical symmetries and a specialized message-passing scheme. Finally, a two-stage discretization procedure converts the continuous weights into multi-hot atomic assignments. To support research in this area, we release a benchmark containing SD, PD, and mixed structures curated from the Crystallography Open Database. Experiments on Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP) and De Novo Generation (DNG) tasks demonstrate that DMFlow significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines adapted from ordered crystal generation. We hope our work provides a foundation for the AI-driven discovery of disordered materials.",

Despite capturing the geometry of the Riemann surface completely, the two languages are subject to rather different sets of auxiliary symmetries. In this article we translate and compare the symplectic transformations inherent in the Jacobi parametrization to the freedom in choosing Möbius transformations generating the Schottky group for the Schottky uniformization. Our results are aimed at transferring functional relations expressed in the Schottky language to the Jacobi language and vice versa. An immediate application would be the efficient numerical evaluation of special functions in a physics context by favorably tuning the Schottky cover leading to quicker convergence.",

SAR is a remote sensing method used in defense and security applications to detect and monitor the positions of military vehicles, which may appear indistinguishable in images. Researchers have extensively studied SAR ATR to improve the differentiation and identification of vehicle types, characteristics, and measurements. Test examples can be compared with known vehicle target types to improve recognition tasks. New methods enhance the capabilities of neural networks, transformer attention, and multimodal large language models. An agentic AI method may be developed to utilize a defined set of tools, such as searching through a library of similar examples. Our proposed method, SAR Retrieval-Augmented Generation (SAR-RAG), combines a multimodal large language model (MLLM) with a vector database of semantic embeddings to support contextual search for image exemplars with known qualities. By recovering past image examples with known true target types, our SAR-RAG system can compare similar vehicle categories, achieving improved ATR prediction accuracy. We evaluate this through search and retrieval metrics, categorical classification accuracy, and numeric regression of vehicle dimensions. These metrics all show improvements when SAR-RAG is added to an MLLM baseline method as an attached ATR memory bank.",

      "abstract": "Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a highly effective paradigm for keeping LLM-based responses up-to-date and reducing the likelihood of hallucinations. Yet, RAG was recently shown to be quite vulnerable to corpus knowledge poisoning: an attacker injects misleading documents to the corpus to steer an LLM's output to an undesired response. We argue that the standard causal attention mechanism in LLMs enables harmful cross-document interactions, specifically in cases of attacks. Accordingly, we introduce a novel defense approach for RAG: Sparse Document Attention RAG (SDAG). This is a block-sparse attention mechanism that disallows cross-attention between retrieved documents. SDAG requires a minimal inference-time change to the attention mask; furthermore, no fine-tuning or additional architectural changes are needed. We present an empirical evaluation of LLM-based question answering (QA) with a variety of attack strategies on RAG. We show that our SDAG method substantially outperforms the standard causal attention mechanism in terms of attack success rate. We further demonstrate the clear merits of integrating SDAG with state-of-the-art RAG defense methods. Specifically, the integration results in performance that is statistically significantly better than the state-of-the-art.",

      "abstract": "Channel charting (CC) has become a key technology for RF-based localization, enabling unsupervised radio fingerprinting, even in non line of sight scenarios, with a minimum of reference position labels. However, most CC models assume fixed-size inputs, such as a constant number of antennas or channel measurements. In practical systems, antennas may fail, signals may be blocked, or antenna sets may change during handovers, making fixed-input architectures fragile. Existing radio-fingerprinting approaches address this by training separate models for each antenna configuration, but the resulting training effort scales prohibitively with the array size. We propose Adaptive Positioning (AdaPos), a CC architecture that natively handles variable numbers of channel measurements. AdaPos combines convolutional feature extraction with a transformer-based encoder using learnable antenna identifiers and self-attention to fuse arbitrary subsets of CSI inputs. Experiments on two public real-world datasets (SISO and MIMO) show that AdaPos maintains state-of-the-art accuracy under missing-antenna conditions and replaces roughly 57 configuration-specific models with a single unified model. With AdaPos and our novel training strategies, we provide resilience to both individual antenna failures and full-array outages.",

      "abstract": "We study the structure and evolution of the very early protostellar disk (``protodisk'') just after protostar formation, where disk self-gravity dominates and the stellar contribution is dynamically minor. The disk redistributes angular momentum outward through outflows and gravitational torques, thereby helping to resolve the angular momentum problem of star formation. We develop a self-similar model and carry out a parameter study that examines disk stability as a function of the key drivers of early evolution, notably the infall rate from the envelope and the strength of the gravitational torques. The mass infall rate onto the disk is estimated to be that from the collapse of a Bonnor-Ebert sphere. Our results indicate that protostellar disks that form from more unstable initial cores are more likely to be Toomre-unstable. We also find that the specific angular momentum of young protostellar disks lie in the range $10^{19}\\text{--}10^{20}\\,{\\rm cm^2\\,s^{-1}}$. We find distinct power-law profiles of physical quantities in the protodisk stage, including a rotation velocity profile that is shallower than the Keplerian profile that would be established at a later stage.

      "abstract": "This article proposes a novel estimator for regression coefficients in clustered data that explicitly accounts for within-cluster dependence. We study the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimator under both finite and infinite cluster sizes. The analysis is then extended to a standard random coefficient model, where we derive asymptotic results for the average (common) parameters and develop a Wald-type test for general linear hypotheses. We also investigate the performance of the conventional pooled ordinary least squares (POLS) estimator within the random coefficients framework and show that it can be unreliable across a wide range of empirically relevant settings. Furthermore, we introduce a new test for parameter stability at a higher (superblock; Tier 2, Tier 3,...) level, assuming that parameters are stable across clusters within that level. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed tests, and an empirical application illustrates their practical relevance.",

      "abstract": "Legal judgment prediction (LJP) aims to predict judicial outcomes from case facts and typically includes law article, charge, and sentencing prediction. While recent methods perform well on the first two subtasks, legal sentencing prediction (LSP) remains difficult due to its need for fine-grained objective knowledge and flexible subjective reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose $MSR^2$, a framework that integrates multi-source retrieval and reasoning in LLMs with reinforcement learning. $MSR^2$ enables LLMs to perform multi-source retrieval based on reasoning needs and applies a process-level reward to guide intermediate subjective reasoning steps. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that $MSR^2$ improves both accuracy and interpretability in LSP, providing a promising step toward practical legal AI.

      "abstract": "Phytoplankton is the basis of marine food webs, driving both ecological processes and global biogeochemical cycles. Despite their ecological and climatic significance, accurately simulating phytoplankton dynamics remains a major challenge for biogeochemical numerical models due to limited parameterizations, sparse observational data, and the complexity of oceanic processes. Here, we explore how deep learning models can be used to address these limitations predicting the spatio-temporal distribution of phytoplankton biomass in the global ocean based on satellite observations and environmental conditions. First, we investigate several deep learning architectures. Among the tested models, the UNet architecture stands out for its ability to reproduce the seasonal and interannual patterns of phytoplankton biomass more accurately than other models like CNNs, ConvLSTM, and 4CastNet. When using one to two months of environmental data as input, UNet performs better, although it tends to underestimate the amplitude of low-frequency changes in phytoplankton biomass. Thus, to improve predictions over time, an auto-regressive version of UNet was also tested, where the model uses its own previous predictions to forecast future conditions. This approach works well for short-term forecasts (up to five months), though its performance decreases for longer time scales. Overall, our study shows that combining ocean physical predictors with deep learning allows for reconstruction and short-term prediction of phytoplankton dynamics. These models could become powerful tools for monitoring ocean health and supporting marine ecosystem management, especially in the context of climate change.",

We introduce two designs, T2A-ControlNet and T2A-Adapter, and show that the T2A-Adapter model offers a more efficient structure with strong control ability. With only 38M additional parameters, T2A-Adapter achieves state-of-the-art performance on the AudioSet-Strong in both event-level and segment-level F1 scores. We further extend this framework to audio editing, proposing T2A-Editor for removing and inserting audio events at time locations specified by instructions. Models, code, dataset pipelines, and benchmarks will be released to support future research on controllable audio generation and editing.",

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as proxies for human judgment in computational social science, yet their ability to reproduce patterns of susceptibility to misinformation remains unclear. We test whether LLM-simulated survey respondents, prompted with participant profiles drawn from social survey data measuring network, demographic, attitudinal and behavioral features, can reproduce human patterns of misinformation belief and sharing. Using three online surveys as baselines, we evaluate whether LLM outputs match observed response distributions and recover feature-outcome associations present in the original survey data. LLM-generated responses capture broad distributional tendencies and show modest correlation with human responses, but consistently overstate the association between belief and sharing. Linear models fit to simulated responses exhibit substantially higher explained variance and place disproportionate weight on attitudinal and behavioral features, while largely ignoring personal network characteristics, relative to models fit to human responses. Analyses of model-generated reasoning and LLM training data suggest that these distortions reflect systematic biases in how misinformation-related concepts are represented. Our findings suggest that LLM-based survey simulations are better suited for diagnosing systematic divergences from human judgment than for substituting it.",

By studying the regularity properties of this application and using lattice discretisations, we prove that chronologically adding the loops from a Brownian loop soup encountered by an independent radial SLE$_2$ path produces a continuous path which has the law of a planar Brownian motion. This resolves a conjecture of Lawler and Werner.   This construction produces a coupling between SLE$_2$ and Brownian motion, and we further show that this joint law is the scaling limit of the loop-erased random walk and the random walk itself. The arguments are robust and can be applied for instance in the off-critical setup, where the scaling limit of loop-erased random walk is Makarov and Smirnov's massive SLE$_2$.",

      "abstract": "Physics informed neural networks provide a meshfree framework for solving partial differential equations by embedding governing physical laws directly into the training process. However, most PINNs developed for fluid dynamics remain restricted to fixed flow parameters, requiring retraining for each new condition and limiting their usefulness as general purpose solvers. In this work, we develop a parameterized PINNs formulation for the incompressible Navier Stokes equations in which the Reynolds number (Re) is treated as an explicit network input, enabling a single trained model to represent a continuous family of flow solutions. The approach is demonstrated using the 2D lid driven cavity flow as a canonical benchmark. For low Re, where the flow is laminar and diffusion dominated, pure PINNs trained solely using the governing equations and boundary conditions accurately reproduce velocity and pressure fields across a wide range of Re, including cases not explicitly sampled during training. As the Re increases and the flow becomes increasingly convection dominated, the predictive accuracy of pure PINNs deteriorates due to stiffness and optimization imbalance. To address this limitation, a hybrid framework is introduced that combines transfer learning with sparse supervision from high fidelity CFD data. The resulting parameterized PINNs model accurately captures the Re dependence of the flow over both interpolation and limited extrapolation regimes while requiring CFD data only over a narrow subset of the parameter space. Detailed comparisons with OpenFOAM simulations demonstrate strong agreement in velocity profiles, and pressure fields. The results show that incorporating governing parameters directly into PINNs enables the construction of parametric Navier Stokes solvers, offering a promising route toward efficient reduced order modeling and data assisted simulation of fluid flows.",

      "abstract": "Reinforcement learning has been widely applied to diffusion and flow models for visual tasks such as text-to-image generation. However, these tasks remain challenging because diffusion models have intractable likelihoods, which creates a barrier for directly applying popular policy-gradient type methods. Existing approaches primarily focus on crafting new objectives built on already heavily engineered LLM objectives, using ad hoc estimators for likelihood, without a thorough investigation into how such estimation affects overall algorithmic performance. In this work, we provide a systematic analysis of the RL design space by disentangling three factors: i) policy-gradient objectives, ii) likelihood estimators, and iii) rollout sampling schemes. We show that adopting an evidence lower bound (ELBO) based model likelihood estimator, computed only from the final generated sample, is the dominant factor enabling effective, efficient, and stable RL optimization, outweighing the impact of the specific policy-gradient loss functional. We validate our findings across multiple reward benchmarks using SD 3.5 Medium, and observe consistent trends across all tasks. Our method improves the GenEval score from 0.24 to 0.95 in 90 GPU hours, which is $4.6\\times$ more efficient than FlowGRPO and $2\\times$ more efficient than the SOTA method DiffusionNFT without reward hacking.",

Our evaluation of frontier models reveals that rationale consistency effectively discriminates among state-of-the-art models and detects deceptive alignment, while outcome accuracy falls short in both respects. To mitigate this gap, we introduce a hybrid signal that combines rationale consistency with outcome accuracy for GenRM training. Our training method achieves state-of-the-art performance on RM-Bench (87.1%) and JudgeBench (82%), surpassing outcome-only baselines by an average of 5%. Using RM during RLHF, our method effectively improves performance as demonstrated on Arena Hard v2, notably yielding a 7% improvement in creative writing tasks. Further analysis confirms that our method escapes the deceptive alignment trap, effectively reversing the decline in rationale consistency observed in outcome-only training.",

It is debated if all massive stars undergo an LBV-like phase during their evolution, or instead LBVs are exotic phenomena. We aim to quantify the incidence of LBV-like variability in the blue supergiant (BSgs) population of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) using the OGLE survey. Here, we extend previous work in the Small Magellanic Cloud to the LMC, where we examine the light curves of 87 B Supergiants (BSgs) (out of 254 known BSgs) spanning timescales of twenty years, and 37 objects across a three year timescale for aperiodic variations resembling known S Dor variables. One blue supergiant, [ST92] 4-13 shows S Dor type photometric variations. New spectra of this object reveals a potential change in spectral type compared to the literature classification. However, based on its spectral characteristics and low luminosity and mass, we do not currently classify it as an LBV. Our study highlights the need to classify bona fide LBVs as stars undergoing both photometric and spectroscopic variations. Based on currently known stellar population of S Dor variables in the LMC, the lifetime of the S Dor phase is at most $\\sim$10$^3$ yrs, in agreement with our duty cycle study based on OGLE data in the SMC. This is orders of magnitude shorter than assumed in literature. Our discovery of LBV-like variability at low luminosities may suggest that S Dor variations could arise from Eddington limit related physics over a wide range of stellar masses, rather than being linked to a unique evolutionary stage.",

      "title": "Towards Structured, State-Aware, and Execution-Grounded Reasoning for Software Engineering Agents",
      "abstract": "Software Engineering (SE) agents have shown promising abilities in supporting various SE tasks. Current SE agents remain fundamentally reactive, making decisions mainly based on conversation history and the most recent response. However, this reactive design provides no explicit structure or persistent state within the agent's memory, making long-horizon reasoning challenging. As a result, SE agents struggle to maintain a coherent understanding across reasoning steps, adapt their hypotheses as new evidence emerges, or incorporate execution feedback into the mental reasoning model of the system state.   In this position paper, we argue that, to further advance SE agents, we need to move beyond reactive behavior toward a structured, state-aware, and execution-grounded reasoning. We outline how explicit structure, persistent and evolving state, and the integration of execution-grounded feedback can help SE agents perform more coherent and reliable reasoning in long-horizon tasks. We also provide an initial roadmap for developing next-generation SE agents that can more effectively perform real-world tasks.",

      "abstract": "Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have largely focused on depth scaling, where a single agent solves long-horizon problems with multi-turn reasoning and tool use. However, as tasks grow broader, the key bottleneck shifts from individual competence to organizational capability. In this work, we explore a complementary dimension of width scaling with multi-agent systems to address broad information seeking. Existing multi-agent systems often rely on hand-crafted workflows and turn-taking interactions that fail to parallelize work effectively. To bridge this gap, we propose WideSeek-R1, a lead-agent-subagent framework trained via multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to synergize scalable orchestration and parallel execution. By utilizing a shared LLM with isolated contexts and specialized tools, WideSeek-R1 jointly optimizes the lead agent and parallel subagents on a curated dataset of 20k broad information-seeking tasks. Extensive experiments show that WideSeek-R1-4B achieves an item F1 score of 40.0% on the WideSearch benchmark, which is comparable to the performance of single-agent DeepSeek-R1-671B. Furthermore, WideSeek-R1-4B exhibits consistent performance gains as the number of parallel subagents increases, highlighting the effectiveness of width scaling.",

These approaches exploit geodesic distances, tangent space representations, and intrinsic statistical measures to achieve more faithful low dimensional embeddings. We also discuss related manifold learning techniques and highlight their theoretical foundations and practical advantages.

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in academic writing workflows, yet they frequently hallucinate by generating citations to sources that do not exist. This study analyzes 100 AI-generated hallucinated citations that appeared in papers accepted by the 2025 Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS), one of the world's most prestigious AI conferences. Despite review by 3-5 expert researchers per paper, these fabricated citations evaded detection, appearing in 53 published papers (approx. 1% of all accepted papers). We develop a five-category taxonomy that classifies hallucinations by their failure mode: Total Fabrication (66%), Partial Attribute Corruption (27%), Identifier Hijacking (4%), Placeholder Hallucination (2%), and Semantic Hallucination (1%). Our analysis reveals a critical finding: every hallucination (100%) exhibited compound failure modes. The distribution of secondary characteristics was dominated by Semantic Hallucination (63%) and Identifier Hijacking (29%), which often appeared alongside Total Fabrication to create a veneer of plausibility and false verifiability. These compound structures exploit multiple verification heuristics simultaneously, explaining why peer review fails to detect them. The distribution exhibits a bimodal pattern: 92% of contaminated papers contain 1-2 hallucinations (minimal AI use) while 8% contain 4-13 hallucinations (heavy reliance). These findings demonstrate that current peer review processes do not include effective citation verification and that the problem extends beyond NeurIPS to other major conferences, government reports, and professional consulting. We propose mandatory automated citation verification at submission as an implementable solution to prevent fabricated citations from becoming normalized in scientific literature.",

      "abstract": "Large language models rely on kv-caches to avoid redundant computation during autoregressive decoding, but as context length grows, reading and writing the cache can quickly saturate GPU memory bandwidth. Recent work has explored KV-cache compression, yet most approaches neglect the data-dependent nature of kv-caches and their variation across layers. We introduce KV-CoRE KV-cache Compressibility by Rank Evaluation), an SVD-based method for quantifying the data-dependent low-rank compressibility of kv-caches. KV-CoRE computes the optimal low-rank approximation under the Frobenius norm and, being gradient-free and incremental, enables efficient dataset-level, layer-wise evaluation. Using this method, we analyze multiple models and datasets spanning five English domains and sixteen languages, uncovering systematic patterns that link compressibility to model architecture, training data, and language coverage. As part of this analysis, we employ the Normalized Effective Rank as a metric of compressibility and show that it correlates strongly with performance degradation under compression. Our study establishes a principled evaluation framework and the first large-scale benchmark of kv-cache compressibility in LLMs, offering insights for dynamic, data-aware compression and data-centric model development.",

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) deliver robust performance across diverse applications, yet their deployment often faces challenges due to the memory and latency costs of storing and accessing billions of parameters. Post-training quantization (PTQ) enables efficient inference by mapping pretrained weights to low-bit formats without retraining, but its effectiveness depends critically on both the quantization objective and the rounding procedure used to obtain low-bit weight representations. In this work, we show that interpolating between symmetric and asymmetric calibration acts as a form of regularization that preserves the standard quadratic structure used in PTQ while providing robustness to activation mismatch. Building on this perspective, we derive a simple successive rounding procedure that naturally incorporates asymmetric calibration, as well as a bounded-search extension that allows for an explicit trade-off between quantization quality and the compute cost. Experiments across multiple LLM families, quantization bit-widths, and benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed bounded search based on a regularized asymmetric calibration objective consistently improves perplexity and accuracy over PTQ baselines, while incurring only modest and controllable additional computational cost.",

Unlike classical local algorithms for multi-objective optimization, our approach does not rely on the dominance property to accept new iterates, which allows for a flexible and function-free optimization framework. New points are obtained using an adaptive stepsize that does not require neither knowledge of Lipschitz constants nor the use of line search procedures. The rate of convergence is analyzed and is shown to be $\\mathcal{O}(1 / \\sqrt{ k+1})$ with respect to the norm of the common descent direction. The method is extensively validated on a broad class of unconstrained multi-objective problems and simple multi-task learning instances, and compared against a first-order line search algorithm. Additionally, we present a preliminary study of the behavior under noisy multi-objective settings, highlighting the robustness of the method.",

      "abstract": "Low-rank matrix sensing is a fundamental yet challenging nonconvex problem whose optimization landscape typically contains numerous spurious local minima, making it difficult for gradient-based optimizers to converge to the global optimum. Recent work has shown that over-parameterization via tensor lifting can convert such local minima into strict saddle points, an insight that also partially explains why massive scaling can improve generalization and performance in modern machine learning. Motivated by this observation, we propose a Simulated Oracle Direction (SOD) escape mechanism that simulates the landscape and escape direction of the over-parametrized space, without resorting to actually lifting the problem, since that would be computationally intractable. In essence, we designed a mathematical framework to project over-parametrized escape directions onto the original parameter space to guarantee a strict decrease of objective value from existing local minima. To the best of the our knowledge, this represents the first deterministic framework that could escape spurious local minima with guarantee, especially without using random perturbations or heuristic estimates. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our framework reliably escapes local minima and facilitates convergence to global optima, while incurring minimal computational cost when compared to explicit tensor over-parameterization. We believe this framework has non-trivial implications for nonconvex optimization beyond matrix sensing, by showcasing how simulated over-parameterization can be leveraged to tame challenging optimization landscapes.",

Adding more data can backfire (e.g., deteriorating performance through model collapse or inadvertently wiping out existing guardrails), spending time on fine-tuning a model can be unnecessary without a prior assessment of what it already knows, setting the temperature to 0 is not sufficient to make LLMs deterministic, providing a large volume of M&S data as input can be excessive (LLMs cannot attend to everything) but naive simplifications can lose information. We aim to provide comprehensive and practical guidance on how to use LLMs, with an emphasis on M&S applications. We discuss common sources of confusion, including non-determinism, knowledge augmentation (including RAG and LoRA), decomposition of M&S data, and hyper-parameter settings.

      "abstract": "We introduce Wedge Sampling, a new non-adaptive sampling scheme for low-rank tensor completion. We study recovery of an order-$k$ low-rank tensor of dimension $n \\times \\cdots \\times n$ from a subset of its entries. Unlike the standard uniform entry model (i.e., i.i.d. samples from $[n]^k$), wedge sampling allocates observations to structured length-two patterns (wedges) in an associated bipartite sampling graph. By directly promoting these length-two connections, the sampling design strengthens the spectral signal that underlies efficient initialization, in regimes where uniform sampling is too sparse to generate enough informative correlations.   Our main result shows that this change in sampling paradigm enables polynomial-time algorithms to achieve both weak and exact recovery with nearly linear sample complexity in $n$. The approach is also plug-and-play: wedge-sampling-based spectral initialization can be combined with existing refinement procedures (e.g., spectral or gradient-based methods) using only an additional $\\tilde{O}(n)$ uniformly sampled entries, substantially improving over the $\\tilde{O}(n^{k/2})$ sample complexity typically required under uniform entry sampling for efficient methods. Overall, our results suggest that the statistical-to-computational gap highlighted in Barak and Moitra (2022) is, to a large extent, a consequence of the uniform entry sampling model for tensor completion, and that alternative non-adaptive measurement designs that guarantee a strong initialization can overcome this barrier.",

We introduce Constrained GRPO, a Lagrangian-based extension of GRPO for constrained policy optimization. Constraints are specified via indicator cost functions, enabling direct optimization of violation rates through a Lagrangian relaxation. We show that a naive multi-component treatment in advantage estimation can break constrained learning: mismatched component-wise standard deviations distort the relative importance of the different objective terms, which in turn corrupts the Lagrangian signal and prevents meaningful constraint enforcement. We formally derive this effect to motivate our scalarized advantage construction that preserves the intended trade-off between reward and constraint terms. Experiments in a toy gridworld confirm the predicted optimization pathology and demonstrate that scalarizing advantages restores stable constraint control. In addition, we evaluate Constrained GRPO on robotics tasks, where it improves constraint satisfaction while increasing task success, establishing a simple and effective recipe for constrained policy optimization in embodied AI domains that increasingly rely on large multimodal foundation models.",

      "abstract": "Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have become a standard tool for mechanistic interpretability in autoregressive large language models (LLMs), enabling researchers to extract sparse, human-interpretable features and intervene on model behavior. Recently, as diffusion language models (DLMs) have become an increasingly promising alternative to the autoregressive LLMs, it is essential to develop tailored mechanistic interpretability tools for this emerging class of models. In this work, we present DLM-Scope, the first SAE-based interpretability framework for DLMs, and demonstrate that trained Top-K SAEs can faithfully extract interpretable features. Notably, we find that inserting SAEs affects DLMs differently than autoregressive LLMs: while SAE insertion in LLMs typically incurs a loss penalty, in DLMs it can reduce cross-entropy loss when applied to early layers, a phenomenon absent or markedly weaker in LLMs. Additionally, SAE features in DLMs enable more effective diffusion-time interventions, often outperforming LLM steering. Moreover, we pioneer certain new SAE-based research directions for DLMs: we show that SAEs can provide useful signals for DLM decoding order; and the SAE features are stable during the post-training phase of DLMs. Our work establishes a foundation for mechanistic interpretability in DLMs and shows a great potential of applying SAEs to DLM-related tasks and algorithms.",

Large language model (LLM) based AI standardized patients (AI-SPs) promise flexible, on-demand practice, yet learners often report that they talk like a patient but feel different. We interviewed 12 clinical-year medical students and conducted three co-design workshops to examine how learners experience constraints of SP encounters and what they expect from AI-SPs. We identified six learner-centered needs, translated them into AI-SP design requirements, and synthesized a conceptual workflow. Our findings position AI-SPs as tools for deliberate practice and show that instructional usability, rather than conversational realism alone, drives learner trust, engagement, and educational value.",

The stochastic block model (SBM) serves as a canonical framework for studying community structure, and exact recovery, identifying the true communities with high probability, is a central theoretical question. While classical results characterize the phase transition for exact recovery based solely on graph connectivity, many real-world networks contain additional data, such as node attributes or labels. In this work, we study exact recovery in the Data Block Model (DBM), an SBM augmented with node-associated data, as formalized by Asadi, Abbe, and Verdú (2017). We introduce the Chernoff--TV divergence and use it to characterize a sharp exact recovery threshold for the DBM. We further provide an efficient algorithm that achieves this threshold, along with a matching converse result showing impossibility below the threshold. Finally, simulations validate our findings and demonstrate the benefits of incorporating vertex data as side information in community detection.",

The multi-crop strategy, which incorporates small local crops to global ones, enhances many SSL frameworks but causes instability in predictor-based architectures such as BYOL, SimSiam, and MoCo v3. We trace this failure to the shared predictor used across all views and demonstrate that assigning a separate predictor to each view type stabilizes multi-crop training, resulting in significant performance gains. Extending this idea, we treat each spatial transformation as a distinct alignment task and add cutout views, where part of the image is masked before encoding. This yields a simple multi-task formulation of asymmetric Siamese SSL that combines global, local, and masked views into a single framework. The approach is stable, generally applicable across backbones, and consistently improves the performance of ResNet and ViT models on ImageNet.",

In this paper, we introduce a Bayesian approach that addresses these difficulties by relying on a low-dimensional representation of physical fields built from Scattering Transform statistics. This representation enables inference to be performed in a compact model space, where we recover a posterior distribution over signal models that are consistent with the observed data. We propose an iterative adaptive algorithm to efficiently approximate this posterior distribution. We apply our method to a large-scale structure column density field from the Quijote simulations, using a realistic instrumental forward operator. We demonstrate both accurate statistical inference and deterministic signal reconstruction from a single contaminated image, without relying on any external prior distribution for the field of interest. These results demonstrate that Scattering Transform statistics provide an effective representation for solving complex imaging inverse problems in challenging low-data regimes. Our approach opens the way to new applications for non-Gaussian astrophysical and cosmological signals for which little or no prior modeling is available.",

This shifts the bottleneck from generation to selection, often without supervision on the target distribution. We show entropy-based exploration proxies follow an inverted-U with accuracy, suggesting extra exploration can become redundant and induce overthinking. We propose NEX, a white-box label-free unsupervised scoring framework that views reasoning as alternating E-phase (exploration) and X-phase (exploitation). NEX detects E-phase as spikes in newly activated MLP neurons per token from sparse activation caches, then uses a sticky two-state HMM to infer E-X phases and credits E-introduced neurons by whether they are reused in the following X span. These signals yield interpretable neuron weights and a single Good-Mass Fraction score to rank candidate responses and merged variants without task answers. Across reasoning benchmarks and Qwen3 merge families, NEX computed on a small unlabeled activation set predicts downstream accuracy and identifies better variants; we further validate the E-X signal with human annotations and provide causal evidence via \"Effective-vs-Redundant\" neuron transfer.",

To address this issue, we reinterpret private learning under LDP as a transfer learning problem, where the noisy data serve as the source domain and the unobserved clean data as the target. We propose novel techniques specifically designed for LDP to improve classification performance without compromising privacy: (1) a noised binary feedback-based evaluation mechanism for estimating dataset utility; (2) model reversal, which salvages underperforming classifiers by inverting their decision boundaries; and (3) model averaging, which assigns weights to multiple reversed classifiers based on their estimated utility.

      "abstract": "General-purpose text embedding models underpin a wide range of NLP and information retrieval applications, and are typically trained on large-scale multi-task corpora to encourage broad generalization. However, it remains unclear how different multi-task training strategies compare in practice, and how to efficiently adapt embedding models as new domains and data types continually emerge. In this work, we present a systematic study of multi-task training for text embeddings from two perspectives: data scheduling and model merging. We compare batch-level shuffling, sequential training variants, two-stage training, and multiple merging granularities, and find that simple batch-level shuffling consistently yields the strongest overall performance, suggesting that task conflicts are limited and training datasets are largely complementary. Despite its effectiveness, batch-level shuffling exhibits two practical limitations: suboptimal out-of-domain (OOD) generalization and poor suitability for incremental learning due to expensive full retraining. To address these issues, we propose Bagging-based rObust mOdel Merging (\\modelname), which trains multiple embedding models on sampled subsets and merges them into a single model, improving robustness while retaining single-model inference efficiency. Moreover, \\modelname naturally supports efficient incremental updates by training lightweight update models on new data with a small historical subset and merging them into the existing model. Experiments across diverse embedding benchmarks demonstrate that \\modelname consistently improves both in-domain and OOD performance over full-corpus batch-level shuffling, while substantially reducing training cost in incremental learning settings.",

We propose Variational Speculative Decoding (VSD), formulating draft training as variational inference over latent proposals (draft paths). VSD maximizes the marginal probability of target-model acceptance, yielding an ELBO that promotes high-quality latent proposals while minimizing divergence from the target distribution. To enhance quality and reduce variance, we incorporate a path-level utility and optimize via an Expectation-Maximization procedure. The E-step draws MCMC samples from an oracle-filtered posterior, while the M-step maximizes weighted likelihood using Adaptive Rejection Weighting (ARW) and Confidence-Aware Regularization (CAR). Theoretical analysis confirms that VSD increases expected acceptance length and speedup. Extensive experiments across LLMs and MLLMs show that VSD achieves up to a 9.6% speedup over EAGLE-3 and 7.9% over ViSpec, significantly improving decoding efficiency.",

To combat this, automated techniques have been developed and shown to be effective, to some extent. However, prior work suggests that these methods often falsely flag essays from non-native speakers as generated, due to their low perplexity extracted from an LLM, which is supposedly a key feature of the detectors. We revisit these statements two years later, specifically in the Czech language setting. We show that the perplexity of texts from non-native speakers of Czech is not lower than that of native speakers. We further examine detectors from three separate families and find no systematic bias against non-native speakers.

      "abstract": "In the era of large foundation models, the quality of embeddings has become a central determinant of downstream task performance and overall system capability. Yet widely used dense embeddings are often extremely high-dimensional, incurring substantial costs in storage, memory, and inference latency. To address these, Contrastive Sparse Representation (CSR) is recently proposed as a promising direction, mapping dense embeddings into high-dimensional but k-sparse vectors, in contrast to compact dense embeddings such as Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL). Despite its promise, CSR suffers severe degradation in the ultra-sparse regime, where over 80% of neurons remain inactive, leaving much of its efficiency potential unrealized. In this paper, we introduce CSRv2, a principled training approach designed to make ultra-sparse embeddings viable. CSRv2 stabilizes sparsity learning through progressive k-annealing, enhances representational quality via supervised contrastive objectives, and ensures end-to-end adaptability with full backbone finetuning. CSRv2 reduces dead neurons from 80% to 20% and delivers a 14% accuracy gain at k=2, bringing ultra-sparse embeddings on par with CSR at k=8 and MRL at 32 dimensions, all with only two active features. While maintaining comparable performance, CSRv2 delivers a 7x speedup over MRL, and yields up to 300x improvements in compute and memory efficiency relative to dense embeddings in text representation. Extensive experiments across text and vision demonstrate that CSRv2 makes ultra-sparse embeddings practical without compromising performance, where CSRv2 achieves 7%/4% improvement over CSR when k=4 and further increases this gap to 14%/6% when k=2 in text/vision representation. By making extreme sparsity viable, CSRv2 broadens the design space for real-time and edge-deployable AI systems where both embedding quality and efficiency are critical.",

      "abstract": "Multimodal embeddings serve as a bridge for aligning vision and language, with the two primary implementations -- CLIP-based and MLLM-based embedding models -- both limited to capturing only global semantic information. Although numerous studies have focused on fine-grained understanding, we observe that complex scenarios currently targeted by MLLM embeddings often involve a hybrid perceptual pattern of both global and fine-grained elements, thus necessitating a compatible fusion mechanism. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Global and Fine-grained perceptual Fusion for MLLM Embeddings (AGFF-Embed), a method that prompts the MLLM to generate multiple embeddings focusing on different dimensions of semantic information, which are then adaptively and smoothly aggregated. Furthermore, we adapt AGFF-Embed with the Explicit Gradient Amplification (EGA) technique to achieve in-batch hard negatives enhancement without requiring fine-grained editing of the dataset. Evaluation on the MMEB and MMVP-VLM benchmarks shows that AGFF-Embed comprehensively achieves state-of-the-art performance in both general and fine-grained understanding compared to other multimodal embedding models.",

We study Muon in a linear associative memory model with softmax retrieval and a hierarchical frequency spectrum over query-answer pairs, with and without label noise. In this setting, we show that Gradient Descent (GD) learns frequency components at highly imbalanced rates, leading to slow convergence bottlenecked by low-frequency components. In contrast, the Muon optimizer mitigates this imbalance, leading to faster and more uniform progress. Specifically, in the noiseless case, Muon achieves an exponential speedup over GD; in the noisy case with a power-decay frequency spectrum, we derive Muon's optimization scaling law and demonstrate its superior scaling efficiency over GD. Furthermore, we show that Muon can be interpreted as an implicit matrix preconditioner arising from adaptive task alignment and block-symmetric gradient structure. In contrast, the preconditioner with coordinate-wise sign operator could match Muon under oracle access to unknown task representations, which is infeasible for SignGD in practice. Experiments on synthetic long-tail classification and LLaMA-style pre-training corroborate the theory.",

While retrieved documents help address knowledge gaps, model-generated responses still suffer from hallucinations that contradict the retrieved information. To mitigate this inconsistency, we propose a Reinforcement Learning framework enhanced with Fine-grained Knowledge Verification (RLFKV). Our method decomposes financial responses into atomic knowledge units and assesses the correctness of each unit to compute the fine-grained faithful reward. This reward offers more precise optimization signals, thereby improving alignment with the retrieved documents. Additionally, to prevent reward hacking (e.g., overly concise replies), we incorporate an informativeness reward that encourages the policy model to retain at least as many knowledge units as the base model. Experiments conducted on the public Financial Data Description (FDD) task and our newly proposed FDD-ANT dataset demonstrate consistent improvements, confirming the effectiveness of our approach.",

We study how to incorporate group fairness constraints into boosting while preserving analyzable training dynamics. Our approach, FairBoost, projects the ensemble-induced exponential-weights distribution onto a convex set of distributions satisfying fairness constraints (as a reweighting surrogate), then trains weak learners on this fair distribution. The key theoretical insight is that projecting the training distribution reduces the effective edge of weak learners by a quantity controlled by the KL-divergence of the projection. We prove an exponential-loss bound where the convergence rate depends on weak learner edge minus a \"fairness cost\" term $δ_t = \\sqrt{\\mathrm{KL}(w^t \\| q^t)/2}$. This directly quantifies the accuracy-fairness tradeoff in boosting dynamics. Experiments on standard benchmarks validate the theoretical predictions and demonstrate competitive fairness-accuracy tradeoffs with stable training curves.",

      "abstract": "Context: AI-assisted tools are increasingly integrated into software development workflows, but their reliance on large language models (LLMs) introduces substantial computational and energy costs. Understanding and reducing the energy footprint of LLM inference is therefore essential for sustainable software development. Objective: In this study, we conduct a phase-level analysis of LLM inference energy consumption, distinguishing between the (1) prefill, where the model processes the input and builds internal representations, and (2) decoding, where output tokens are generated using the stored state. Method: We investigate six 6B-7B and four 3B-4B transformer-based models, evaluating them on code-centric benchmarks HumanEval for code generation and LongBench for code understanding. Results: Our findings show that, within both parameter groups, models exhibit distinct energy patterns across phases. Furthermore, we observed that increases in prefill cost amplify the energy cost per token during decoding, with amplifications ranging from 1.3% to 51.8% depending on the model. Lastly, three out of ten models demonstrate babbling behavior, adding excessive content to the output that unnecessarily inflates energy consumption. We implemented babbling suppression for code generation, achieving energy savings ranging from 44% to 89% without affecting generation accuracy. Conclusion: These findings show that prefill costs influence decoding, which dominates energy consumption, and that babbling suppression can yield up to 89% energy savings. Reducing inference energy therefore requires both mitigating babbling behavior and limiting impact of prefill on decoding.",

However, standard LoRA follows an explicit-rank paradigm, where increasing model capacity requires adding more rows or columns (i.e., basis vectors) to the low-rank matrices, leading to substantial parameter growth. In this paper, we find that these basis vectors exhibit significant parameter redundancy and can be compactly represented by lightweight nonlinear functions. Therefore, we propose Generative Low-Rank Adapter (GenLoRA), which replaces explicit basis vector storage with nonlinear basis vector generation. Specifically, GenLoRA maintains a latent vector for each low-rank matrix and employs a set of lightweight radial basis functions (RBFs) to synthesize the basis vectors. Each RBF requires far fewer parameters than an explicit basis vector, enabling higher parameter efficiency in GenLoRA. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and architectures show that GenLoRA attains higher effective LoRA ranks under smaller parameter budgets, resulting in superior fine-tuning performance.

Existing approaches typically estimate energy consumption through simple linear functions of input and output sequence lengths, yet our observations reveal clear Energy Efficiency regimes: peak efficiency occurs with short-to-moderate inputs and medium-length outputs, while efficiency drops sharply for long inputs or very short outputs, indicating a non-linear dependency. In this work, we propose an analytical model derived from the computational and memory-access complexity of the Transformer architecture, capable of accurately characterizing the efficiency curve as a function of input and output lengths. To assess its accuracy, we evaluate energy consumption using TensorRT-LLM on NVIDIA H100 GPUs across a diverse set of LLMs ranging from 1B to 9B parameters, including OPT, LLaMA, Gemma, Falcon, Qwen2, and Granite, tested over input and output lengths from 64 to 4096 tokens, achieving a mean MAPE of 1.79%. Our results show that aligning sequence lengths with these efficiency \"Sweet Spots\" can substantially reduce energy usage, supporting informed truncation, summarization, and adaptive generation strategies in production systems.",

In industry deployments characterized by a limited number of entities possessing abundant data, the significance of a participant's role in shaping the global model becomes pivotal given that participation in a federation incurs costs, and participants may expect compensation for their involvement. Additionally, the contributions of participants serve as a crucial means to identify and address potential malicious actors and free-riders. However, fairly assessing individual contributions remains a significant hurdle. Recent works have demonstrated a considerable inherent instability in contribution estimations across aggregation strategies. While employing a different strategy may offer convergence benefits, this instability can have potentially harming effects on the willingness of participants in engaging in the federation. In this work, we introduce FedRandom, a novel mitigation technique to the contribution instability problem. Tackling the instability as a statistical estimation problem, FedRandom allows us to generate more samples than when using regular FL strategies. We show that these additional samples provide a more consistent and reliable evaluation of participant contributions. We demonstrate our approach using different data distributions across CIFAR-10, MNIST, CIFAR-100 and FMNIST and show that FedRandom reduces the overall distance to the ground truth by more than a third in half of all evaluated scenarios, and improves stability in more than 90% of cases.",

      "abstract": "The choice of activation function is an active area of research, with different proposals aimed at improving optimization, while maintaining expressivity. Additionally, the activation function can significantly alter the implicit inductive bias of the architecture, controlling its non-linear behavior. In this paper, in line with previous work, we argue that evolutionary search provides a useful framework for finding new activation functions, while we also make two novel observations. The first is that modern pipelines, such as AlphaEvolve, which relies on frontier LLMs as a mutator operator, allows for a much wider and flexible search space; e.g., over all possible python functions within a certain FLOP budget, eliminating the need for manually constructed search spaces. In addition, these pipelines will be biased towards meaningful activation functions, given their ability to represent common knowledge, leading to a potentially more efficient search of the space. The second observation is that, through this framework, one can target not only performance improvements but also activation functions that encode particular inductive biases. This can be done by using performance on out-of-distribution data as a fitness function, reflecting the degree to which the architecture respects the inherent structure in the data in a manner independent of distribution shifts. We carry an empirical exploration of this proposal and show that relatively small scale synthetic datasets can be sufficient for AlphaEvolve to discover meaningful activations.",

Using cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk reduction as a use case, 16 HCPs reviewed multimodal PGHD in a mixed-methods study with a prototype that integrated common charts, LLM-generated summaries, and a conversational interface. Findings show that AI summaries provided quick overviews that anchored exploration, while conversational interaction supported flexible analysis and bridged data-literacy gaps.

      "abstract": "Over the past two decades, research in evolutionary multi-objective optimization has predominantly focused on continuous domains, with comparatively limited attention given to multi-objective combinatorial optimization problems (MOCOPs). Combinatorial problems differ significantly from continuous ones in terms of problem structure and landscape. Recent studies have shown that on MOCOPs multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) can even be outperformed by simple randomised local search. Starting with a randomly sampled solution in search space, randomised local search iteratively draws a random solution (from an archive) to perform local variation within its neighbourhood. However, in most existing methods, the local variation relies on a fixed neighbourhood, which limits exploration and makes the search easy to get trapped in local optima. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective local search method, called variable stepsize randomized local search (VS-RLS), which adjusts the stepsize during the search. VS-RLS transitions gradually from a broad, exploratory search in the early phases to a more focused, fine-grained search as the search progresses. We demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of VS-RLS through extensive evaluations against local search and MOEAs methods on diverse MOCOPs.",

      "title": "Tight Long-Term Tail Decay of (Clipped) SGD in Non-Convex Optimization",
      "abstract": "The study of tail behaviour of SGD-induced processes has been attracting a lot of interest, due to offering strong guarantees with respect to individual runs of an algorithm. While many works provide high-probability guarantees, quantifying the error rate for a fixed probability threshold, there is a lack of work directly studying the probability of failure, i.e., quantifying the tail decay rate for a fixed error threshold. Moreover, existing results are of finite-time nature, limiting their ability to capture the true long-term tail decay which is more informative for modern learning models, typically trained for millions of iterations. Our work closes these gaps, by studying the long-term tail decay of SGD-based methods through the lens of large deviations theory, establishing several strong results in the process. First, we provide an upper bound on the tails of the gradient norm-squared of the best iterate produced by (vanilla) SGD, for non-convex costs and bounded noise, with long-term decay at rate $e^{-t/\\log(t)}$. Next, we relax the noise assumption by considering clipped SGD (c-SGD) under heavy-tailed noise with bounded moment of order $p \\in (1,2]$, showing an upper bound with long-term decay at rate $e^{-t^{β_p}/\\log(t)}$, where $β_p = \\frac{4(p-1)}{3p-2}$ for $p \\in (1,2)$ and $e^{-t/\\log^2(t)}$ for $p = 2$. Finally, we provide lower bounds on the tail decay, at rate $e^{-t}$, showing that our rates for both SGD and c-SGD are tight, up to poly-logarithmic factors. Notably, our results demonstrate an order of magnitude faster long-term tail decay compared to existing work based on finite-time bounds, which show rates $e^{-\\sqrt{t}}$ and $e^{-t^{β_p/2}}$, $p \\in (1,2]$, for SGD and c-SGD, respectively. As such, we uncover regimes where the tails decay much faster than previously known, providing stronger long-term guarantees for individual runs.",

For Hebrew, instead, monolingual and multilingual models diverge. A multilingual model using character-level tokenization fails to capture the language non-concatenative morphology, but a monolingual model with morpheme-aware segmentation performs well.

We instantiate the conditional likelihood with a heavy-tailed Student-$t$ model using a polar decomposition that explicitly decouples directional and radial factors to prevent norm-induced instabilities during training. VJE employs an amortized inference network to parameterize a diagonal Gaussian variational posterior whose feature-wise variances are shared with the likelihood scale to capture anisotropic uncertainty without auxiliary projection heads. Across ImageNet-1K, CIFAR-10/100, and STL-10, VJE achieves performance comparable to standard non-contrastive baselines under linear and k-NN evaluation. We further validate these probabilistic semantics through one-class CIFAR-10 anomaly detection, where likelihood-based scoring under the proposed model outperforms comparable self-supervised baselines.",

In this work, we argue that these failures arise not solely from optimization or unlearning algorithms, but from how models structure their internal representations during training. We explore if having explicit multiplicative interactions as an architectural inductive bias helps in structural disentanglement, through Bilinear MLPs. We show analytically that bilinear parameterizations possess a `non-mixing' property under gradient flow conditions, where functional components separate into orthogonal subspace representations. This provides a mathematical foundation for surgical model modification. We validate this hypothesis through a series of controlled experiments spanning modular arithmetic, cyclic reasoning, Lie group dynamics, and targeted unlearning benchmarks. Unlike pointwise nonlinear networks, multiplicative architectures are able to recover true operators aligned with the underlying algebraic structure. Our results suggest that model editability and generalization are constrained by representational structure, and that architectural inductive bias plays a central role in enabling reliable unlearning.",

      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have advanced the development of personalized learning in education. However, their inherent generation mechanisms often produce homogeneous responses to identical prompts. This one-size-fits-all mechanism overlooks the substantial heterogeneity in students cognitive and psychological, thereby posing potential safety risks to vulnerable groups. Existing safety evaluations primarily rely on context-independent metrics such as factual accuracy, bias, or toxicity, which fail to capture the divergent harms that the same response might cause across different student attributes. To address this gap, we propose the concept of Student-Tailored Personalized Safety and construct CASTLE based on educational theories. This benchmark covers 15 educational safety risks and 14 student attributes, comprising 92,908 bilingual scenarios. We further design three evaluation metrics: Risk Sensitivity, measuring the model ability to detect risks; Emotional Empathy, evaluating the model capacity to recognize student states; and Student Alignment, assessing the match between model responses and student attributes. Experiments on 18 SOTA LLMs demonstrate that CASTLE poses a significant challenge: all models scored below an average safety rating of 2.3 out of 5, indicating substantial deficiencies in personalized safety assurance.",

We propose \\emph{Path-Guided Flow Matching (PGFM)}, the first flow matching-based framework for generative distillation, which enables fast deterministic synthesis by solving an ODE in a few steps. PGFM conducts flow matching in the latent space of a frozen VAE to learn class-conditional transport from Gaussian noise to data distribution. Particularly, we develop a continuous path-to-prototype guidance algorithm for ODE-consistent path control, which allows trajectories to reliably land on assigned prototypes while preserving diversity and efficiency. Extensive experiments across high-resolution benchmarks demonstrate that PGFM matches or surpasses prior diffusion-based distillation approaches with fewer steps of sampling while delivering competitive performance with remarkably improved efficiency, e.g., 7.6$\\times$ more efficient than the diffusion-based counterparts with 78\\% mode coverage.",

MESS extends the two-dimensional TODCOR approach to a global multi-epoch formalism, deriving the radial velocities (RVs) of both components at each epoch while optimizing the templates jointly across all observations. Template optimization searches a continuous synthetic-spectra manifold spanning an eight-dimensional parameter space: effective temperature, surface gravity, and rotational broadening for each star, together with a common metallicity and the flux ratio. Single-lined spectroscopic binaries (SB1) and single stars (S1) are handled within the same framework by fitting one optimized template, with either epoch-dependent RVs (SB1) or a single shared RV (S1). Model selection among S1/SB1/SB2 uses the Bayesian information criterion with an effective sample size that accounts for intra-spectrum correlations, and is complemented by the Wilson relation between the two RVs to infer the mass ratio and systemic velocity without a full orbital solution. We validate MESS on 1500 simulated LAMOST MRS systems (SNR=50), with primary RV semi-amplitudes predominantly below the instrumental resolution, achieving an overall classification accuracy of ~95%. We also derive full orbital solutions for two SB2 systems detected in our LAMOST analysis, including a faint-secondary case with flux ratio ~0.1, and present example outputs for one SB1 and three constant-velocity stars. A companion paper will report the survey-wide application to LAMOST DR11 and the resulting SB1/SB2 catalogs.",

Prior work often assumes an equivalence between the Fisher Information Matrix and the Hessian for negative log-likelihood losses, leading to the claim that the SGD noise covariance $\\mathbf{C}$ is proportional to the Hessian $\\mathbf{H}$. We show that this assumption holds only under restrictive conditions that are typically violated in deep neural networks. Using the recently discovered Activity--Weight Duality, we find a more general relationship agnostic to the specific loss formulation, showing that $\\mathbf{C} \\propto \\mathbb{E}_p[\\mathbf{h}_p^2]$, where $\\mathbf{h}_p$ denotes the per-sample Hessian with $\\mathbf{H} = \\mathbb{E}_p[\\mathbf{h}_p]$.

In contrast to classical MDPs, which account for stochasticity by modeling the dynamics through a stochastic process with a known transition kernel, a robust MDP additionally accounts for ambiguity by optimizing against the most adverse transition kernel from an ambiguity set constructed via historical data. In this paper, we develop a unified solution framework for a broad class of robust MDPs with $s$-rectangular ambiguity sets, where the most adverse transition probabilities are considered independently for each state. Using our algorithms, we show that $s$-rectangular robust MDPs with $1$- and $2$-norm as well as $φ$-divergence ambiguity sets can be solved several orders of magnitude faster than with state-of-the-art commercial solvers, and often only a logarithmic factor slower than classical MDPs.

This construction is agnostic to the choice of surrogate and PDMP, and we demonstrate it for the Zig-Zag sampler and the Bouncy particle sampler with constant, Laplace, and Gaussian process (GP) surrogates, including gradient-informed and adaptively refined GP variants. As a representative application, we consider Bayesian inference of a spatially varying Young's modulus in a one-dimensional linear elasticity problem.

      "abstract": "We propose LOGDIFF (Logical Guidance for the Exact Composition of Diffusion Models), a guidance framework for diffusion models that enables principled constrained generation with complex logical expressions at inference time.   We study when exact score-based guidance for complex logical formulas can be obtained from guidance signals associated with atomic properties.   First, we derive an exact Boolean calculus that provides a sufficient condition for exact logical guidance.   Specifically, if a formula admits a circuit representation in which conjunctions combine conditionally independent subformulas and disjunctions combine subformulas that are either conditionally independent or mutually exclusive, exact logical guidance is achievable.   In this case, the guidance signal can be computed exactly from atomic scores and posterior probabilities using an efficient recursive algorithm.   Moreover, we show that, for commonly encountered classes of distributions, any desired Boolean formula is compilable into such a circuit representation.   Second, by combining atomic guidance scores with posterior probability estimates, we introduce a hybrid guidance approach that bridges classifierguidance and classifier-free guidance, applicable to both compositional logical guidance and standard conditional generation.   We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on multiple image and protein structure generation tasks.",

      "abstract": "Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at complex reasoning tasks, but their efficiency is often hampered by overly verbose outputs. Prior steering methods attempt to address this issue by applying a single, global vector to hidden representations -- an approach grounded in the restrictive linear representation hypothesis. In this work, we introduce FlowSteer, a nonlinear steering method that goes beyond uniform linear shifts by learning a complete transformation between the distributions associated with verbose and concise reasoning. This transformation is learned via Flow Matching as a velocity field, enabling precise, input-dependent control over the model's reasoning process. By aligning steered representations with the distribution of concise-reasoning activations, FlowSteer yields more compact reasoning than the linear shifts. Across diverse reasoning benchmarks, FlowSteer demonstrates strong task performance and token efficiency compared to leading inference-time baselines. Our work demonstrates that modeling the full distributional transport with generative techniques offers a more effective and principled foundation for controlling LRMs.",

      "abstract": "We study conditional generation in diffusion models under hard constraints, where generated samples must satisfy prescribed events with probability one. Such constraints arise naturally in safety-critical applications and in rare-event simulation, where soft or reward-based guidance methods offer no guarantee of constraint satisfaction. Building on a probabilistic interpretation of diffusion models, we develop a principled conditional diffusion guidance framework based on Doob's h-transform, martingale representation and quadratic variation process. Specifically, the resulting guided dynamics augment a pretrained diffusion with an explicit drift correction involving the logarithmic gradient of a conditioning function, without modifying the pretrained score network. Leveraging martingale and quadratic-variation identities, we propose two novel off-policy learning algorithms based on a martingale loss and a martingale-covariation loss to estimate h and its gradient using only trajectories from the pretrained model. We provide non-asymptotic guarantees for the resulting conditional sampler in both total variation and Wasserstein distances, explicitly characterizing the impact of score approximation and guidance estimation errors. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in enforcing hard constraints and generating rare-event samples.",

We focus on two classes of problems: monotone VIs; and structured nonmonotone VIs that admit a solution to the weak Minty VI. The latter assumption allows us to solve structured nonconvex-nonconcave min-max problems. For both classes of VIs, to make the expected residual norm less than $\\varepsilon$, we show an oracle complexity of $\\widetilde{O}(\\varepsilon^{-4})$, which is the best-known for constrained VIs. In our setting, this complexity had been obtained with the bounded variance assumption in the literature, which is not even satisfied for bilinear min-max problems with an unbounded domain. We obtain this complexity for stochastic oracles whose variance can grow as fast as the squared norm of the optimization variable.",

      "abstract": "Agentic large language models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated on cybersecurity tasks using capture-the-flag (CTF) benchmarks. However, existing pointwise benchmarks have limited ability to shed light on the robustness and generalisation abilities of agents across alternative versions of the source code. We introduce CTF challenge families, whereby a single CTF is used as the basis for generating a family of semantically-equivalent challenges via semantics-preserving program transformations. This enables controlled evaluation of agent robustness to source code transformations while keeping the underlying exploit strategy fixed. We introduce a new tool, Evolve-CTF, that generates CTF families from Python challenges using a range of transformations. Using Evolve-CTF to derive families from Cybench and Intercode challenges, we evaluate 13 agentic LLM configurations with tool access. We find that models are remarkably robust to intrusive renaming and code insertion-based transformations, but that composed transformations and deeper obfuscation affect performance by requiring more sophisticated use of tools. We also find that enabling explicit reasoning has little effect on solution success rates across challenge families. Our work contributes a valuable technique and tool for future LLM evaluations, and a large dataset characterising the capabilities of current state-of-the-art models in this domain.",

On the corruption benchmark ModelNet40-C, Mapper-GIN achieves competitive and stable accuracy under Noise and Transformation corruptions with only 0.5M parameters. In contrast to prior approaches that require heavier architectures or additional mechanisms to gain robustness, Mapper-GIN attains strong corruption robustness through simple region-level graph abstraction and GIN message passing. Overall, our results suggest that region-graph structure offers an efficient and interpretable source of robustness for 3D visual recognition.",

We model page inclusion in Grokipedia as a function of Wikipedia page popularity, density of reference, and recent editorial activity. Inclusion is non-uniform: pages with higher visibility and greater editorial conflict in Wikipedia are more likely to appear in Grokipedia. For included pages, we distinguish between verbatim reproduction and generative rewriting. Rewriting is more frequent for pages with higher reference density and recent controversy, while highly popular pages are more often reproduced without modification. We compare editing activity across the two platforms and estimate page complexity using a fitness-complexity framework to assess whether generative mediation alters patterns of editorial participation. To assess narrative organization, we construct actor-relation networks from article texts using abstract meaning representation. Across multiple topical domains, including U.S. politics, geopolitics, and conspiracy-related narratives, narrative structure remains largely consistent between the two sources. Analysis of lead sections shows broadly correlated framing, with localized shifts in laudatory and conflict-oriented language for some topics in Grokipedia. Overall, generative systems preserve the main structural organization of encyclopedic content, while affecting how content is selected, rewritten, and framed.",

Natural language processing techniques were employed to extract clinically relevant features from textual reports, while image data underwent domain specific preprocessing and augmentation. Using this dataset, a multimodal deep learning model was developed to classify ameloblastoma variants, assess behavioral patterns such as recurrence risk, and support surgical planning. The model is designed to accept clinical inputs such as presenting complaint, age, and gender during deployment to enhance personalized inference. Quantitative evaluation demonstrated substantial improvements; variant classification accuracy increased from 46.2 percent to 65.9 percent, and abnormal tissue detection F1-score improved from 43.0 percent to 90.3 percent.

Existing algorithms achieving this bound are based on momentum, but are always complemented with safeguard mechanisms, such as restarts or negative-curvature exploitation steps. Whether such mechanisms are fundamentally necessary has remained an open question. Leveraging the continuized method, we show that a Nesterov momentum algorithm with stochastic parameters alone achieves the same complexity in expectation. This result holds up to a multiplicative stochastic factor with unit expectation and a restriction to a subset of the realizations, both of which are independent of the objective function. We empirically verify that these constitute mild limitations.",

Most existing RLVR methods, such as GRPO and its variants, ensure stable updates by constraining policy divergence through clipping likelihood ratios. This paper introduces a unified clipping framework that characterizes existing methods via a general notion of policy divergence, encompassing both likelihood ratios and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergences and extending to alternative measures. The framework provides a principled foundation for systematically analyzing how different policy divergence measures affect exploration and performance. We further identify the KL3 estimator, a variance-reduced Monte Carlo estimator of the KL divergence, as a key policy divergence constraint. We theoretically demonstrate that the KL3-based constraint is mathematically equivalent to an asymmetric ratio-based clipping that reallocates probability mass toward high-confidence actions, promoting stronger exploration while retaining the simplicity of GRPO-style methods. Empirical results on mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that incorporating the KL3 estimator into GRPO improves both training stability and final performance, highlighting the importance of principled policy divergence constraints in policy optimization.",

We propose a vision for drift observability on the simplex: model drift and boundary proximity in Aitchison geometry to obtain coordinate-invariant direction and distance-to-safety in interpretable balance coordinates. To remain comparable under churn, a monitor would continuously refresh its part inventory and policy-defined boundaries from engineering artifacts and apply lineage-aware aggregation.

      "abstract": "Contemporary knowledge-based systems increasingly rely on multilingual emotion identification to support intelligent decision-making, yet they face major challenges due to emotional ambiguity and incomplete supervision. Emotion recognition from text is inherently uncertain because multiple emotional states often co-occur and emotion annotations are frequently missing or heterogeneous. Most existing multi-label emotion classification methods assume fully observed labels and rely on deterministic learning objectives, which can lead to biased learning and unreliable predictions under partial supervision. This paper introduces Reasoning under Ambiguity, an uncertainty-aware framework for multilingual multi-label emotion classification that explicitly aligns learning with annotation uncertainty. The proposed approach uses a shared multilingual encoder with language-specific optimization and an entropy-based ambiguity weighting mechanism that down-weights highly ambiguous training instances rather than treating missing labels as negative evidence. A mask-aware objective with positive-unlabeled regularization is further incorporated to enable robust learning under partial supervision. Experiments on English, Spanish, and Arabic emotion classification benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines across multiple evaluation metrics, along with improved training stability, robustness to annotation sparsity, and enhanced interpretability.",

      "abstract": "Continual learning (CL) empowers AI systems to progressively acquire knowledge from non-stationary data streams. However, catastrophic forgetting remains a critical challenge. In this work, we identify attention drift in Vision Transformers as a primary source of catastrophic forgetting, where the attention to previously learned visual concepts shifts significantly after learning new tasks. Inspired by neuroscientific insights into the selective attention in the human visual system, we propose a novel attention-retaining framework to mitigate forgetting in CL. Our method constrains attention drift by explicitly modifying gradients during backpropagation through a two-step process: 1) extracting attention maps of the previous task using a layer-wise rollout mechanism and generating instance-adaptive binary masks, and 2) when learning a new task, applying these masks to zero out gradients associated with previous attention regions, thereby preventing disruption of learned visual concepts. For compatibility with modern optimizers, the gradient masking process is further enhanced by scaling parameter updates proportionally to maintain their relative magnitudes. Experiments and visualizations demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in mitigating catastrophic forgetting and preserving visual concepts. It achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits robust generalizability across diverse CL scenarios.",

      "abstract": "Large language models have emerged as powerful zero-shot rerankers for retrieval-augmented generation, offering strong generalization without task-specific training. However, existing LLM reranking methods either rely on heuristics that fail to fully exploit the information revealed by each ranking decision or are inefficient when they do. We introduce a tournament graph framework that provides a principled foundation for $k$-wise reranking. Our key observation is that each $k$-document comparison reveals a complete tournament of $\\binom{k}{2}$ pairwise preferences. These tournaments are aggregated into a global preference graph, whose transitive closure yields many additional orderings without further model invocations. We formalize when a candidate's rank is certifiably determined and design a query schedule that greedily maximizes information gain towards identifying the top-$m$ items. Our framework also gracefully handles non-transitive preferences - cycles induced by LLM judgments - by collapsing them into equivalence classes that yield principled tiered rankings. Empirically, across 14 benchmarks and 5 LLMs, our method achieves Pareto dominance over existing methods: matching or exceeding accuracy while requiring 25-40% fewer tokens than comparable approaches, and 7$\\times$ fewer than pairwise methods at near-identical quality.",

      "abstract": "Large Language Model agents increasingly operate external systems through programmatic interfaces, yet practitioners lack empirical guidance on how to structure the context these agents consume. Using SQL generation as a proxy for programmatic agent operations, we present a systematic study of context engineering for structured data, comprising 9,649 experiments across 11 models, 4 formats (YAML, Markdown, JSON, Token-Oriented Object Notation [TOON]), and schemas ranging from 10 to 10,000 tables.   Our findings challenge common assumptions. First, architecture choice is model-dependent: file-based context retrieval improves accuracy for frontier-tier models (Claude, GPT, Gemini; +2.7%, p=0.029) but shows mixed results for open source models (aggregate -7.7%, p<0.001), with deficits varying substantially by model. Second, format does not significantly affect aggregate accuracy (chi-squared=2.45, p=0.484), though individual models, particularly open source, exhibit format-specific sensitivities. Third, model capability is the dominant factor, with a 21 percentage point accuracy gap between frontier and open source tiers that dwarfs any format or architecture effect. Fourth, file-native agents scale to 10,000 tables through domain-partitioned schemas while maintaining high navigation accuracy. Fifth, file size does not predict runtime efficiency: compact formats can consume significantly more tokens at scale due to format-unfamiliar search patterns.   These findings provide practitioners with evidence-based guidance for deploying LLM agents on structured systems, demonstrating that architectural decisions should be tailored to model capability rather than assuming universal best practices.",

      "abstract": "Traditional deep learning models often lack annotated data, especially in cross-domain applications such as anomaly detection, which is critical for early disease diagnosis in medicine and defect detection in industry. To address this challenge, we propose Multi-AD, a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for robust unsupervised anomaly detection across medical and industrial images. Our approach employs the squeeze-and-excitation (SE) block to enhance feature extraction via channel-wise attention, enabling the model to focus on the most relevant features and detect subtle anomalies. Knowledge distillation (KD) transfers informative features from the teacher to the student model, enabling effective learning of the differences between normal and anomalous data. Then, the discriminator network further enhances the model's capacity to distinguish between normal and anomalous data. At the inference stage, by integrating multi-scale features, the student model can detect anomalies of varying sizes. The teacher-student (T-S) architecture ensures consistent representation of high-dimensional features while adapting them to enhance anomaly detection. Multi-AD was evaluated on several medical datasets, including brain MRI, liver CT, and retina OCT, as well as industrial datasets, such as MVTec AD, demonstrating strong generalization across multiple domains. Experimental results demonstrated that our approach consistently outperformed state-of-the-art models, achieving the best average AUROC for both image-level (81.4% for medical and 99.6% for industrial) and pixel-level (97.0% for medical and 98.4% for industrial) tasks, making it effective for real-world applications.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge graphs (KGs) have become a key ingredient supporting a variety of applications. Beyond the traditional triplet representation of facts where a relation connects two entities, modern KGs observe an increasing number of hyper-relational facts, where an arbitrary number of qualifiers associated with a triplet provide auxiliary information to further describe the rich semantics of the triplet, which can effectively boost the reasoning performance in link prediction tasks. However, existing link prediction techniques over such hyper-relational KGs (HKGs) mostly focus on a transductive setting, where KG embedding models are learned from the specific vocabulary of a given KG and subsequently can only make predictions within the same vocabulary, limiting their generalizability to previously unseen vocabularies. Against this background, we propose THOR, an inducTive link prediction technique for Hyper-relational knOwledge gRaphs. Specifically, we first introduce both relation and entity foundation graphs, modeling their fundamental inter- and intra-fact interactions in HKGs, which are agnostic to any specific relations and entities. Afterward, THOR is designed to learn from the two foundation graphs with two parallel graph encoders followed by a transformer decoder, which supports efficient masked training and fully-inductive inference. We conduct a thorough evaluation of THOR in hyper-relational link prediction tasks on 12 datasets with different settings. Results show that THOR outperforms a sizable collection of baselines, yielding 66.1%, 55.9%, and 20.4% improvement over the best-performing rule-based, semi-inductive, and fully-inductive techniques, respectively. A series of ablation studies also reveals our key design factors capturing the structural invariance transferable across HKGs for inductive tasks.",

Currently, reference-based metrics are a popular choice, which basically measure the similarity between hypothesis and reference sentences. However, similarity measures based on embeddings, such as BERTScore, are often ineffective, since many words in the source sentences remain unchanged in both the hypothesis and the reference. This study focuses on edits specifically designed for GEC, i.e., ERRANT, and computes similarity measured over the edits from the source sentence. To this end, we propose edit vector, a representation for an edit, and introduce a new metric, UOT-ERRANT, which transports these edit vectors from hypothesis to reference using unbalanced optimal transport. Experiments with SEEDA meta-evaluation show that UOT-ERRANT improves evaluation performance, particularly in the +Fluency domain where many edits occur. Moreover, our method is highly interpretable because the transport plan can be interpreted as a soft edit alignment, making UOT-ERRANT a useful metric for both system ranking and analyzing GEC systems.

The analysis focuses on the primal-dual solution mapping of the regularized lower-level problem and exploits its properties to derive an almost-everywhere formula for the gradient of the regularized hyper-objective under mild assumptions. The paper then establishes conditions under which the hyper-objective of the actual problem is well defined and shows that its gradient can be approximated by the gradient of the regularized hyper-objective. Building on these results, a gradient sampling-based algorithm computes approximately stationary points of the regularized hyper-objective, and we prove its convergence to stationary points of the actual problem.

      "abstract": "Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection under long-tailed distributions is a highly challenging task because the scarcity of samples in tail classes leads to blurred decision boundaries in the feature space. Current state-of-the-art (sota) methods typically employ Outlier Exposure (OE) strategies, relying on large-scale real external datasets (such as 80 Million Tiny Images) to regularize the feature space. However, this dependence on external data often becomes infeasible in practical deployment due to high data acquisition costs and privacy sensitivity. To this end, we propose a novel data-free framework aimed at completely eliminating reliance on external datasets while maintaining superior detection performance. We introduce a Geometry-guided virtual Outlier Synthesis (GOS) strategy that models statistical properties using the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution on a hypersphere. Specifically, we locate a low-likelihood annulus in the feature space and perform directional sampling of virtual outliers in this region. Simultaneously, we introduce a new Dual-Granularity Semantic Loss (DGS) that utilizes contrastive learning to maximize the distinction between in-distribution (ID) features and these synthesized boundary outliers. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as CIFAR-LT demonstrate that our method outperforms sota approaches that utilize external real images.",

However, the distributed nature of this approach still raises privacy and security issues, such as the exposure of sensitive data due to inference attacks and the influence of Byzantine behaviors on the trained model. In particular, achieving both secure aggregation and Byzantine resilience remains challenging, as existing solutions often address these aspects independently. In this work, we propose to address these challenges through a novel approach that combines homomorphic encryption for privacy-preserving aggregation with property-inference-inspired meta-classifiers for Byzantine filtering. First, following the property-inference attacks blueprint, we train a set of filtering meta-classifiers on labeled shadow updates, reproducing a diverse ensemble of Byzantine misbehaviors in FL, including backdoor, gradient-inversion, label-flipping and shuffling attacks. The outputs of these meta-classifiers are then used to cancel the Byzantine encrypted updates by reweighting. Second, we propose an automated method for selecting the optimal kernel and the dimensionality hyperparameters with respect to homomorphic inference, aggregation constraints and efficiency over the CKKS cryptosystem. Finally, we demonstrate through extensive experiments the effectiveness of our approach against Byzantine participants on the FEMNIST, CIFAR10, GTSRB, and acsincome benchmarks. More precisely, our SVM filtering achieves accuracies between $90$% and $94$% for identifying Byzantine updates at the cost of marginal losses in model utility and encrypted inference runtimes ranging from $6$ to $24$ seconds and from $9$ to $26$ seconds for an overall aggregation.",

However, existing methods show two notable limitations in improving user search satisfaction: inadequate modeling of multifaceted user intents and neglect of rich side information such as visual perception signals. To address these challenges, we propose the Rich-Media Re-Ranker framework, which aims to enhance user search satisfaction through multi-dimensional and fine-grained modeling. Our approach begins with a Query Planner that analyzes the sequence of query refinements within a session to capture genuine search intents, decomposing the query into clear and complementary sub-queries to enable broader coverage of users' potential intents. Subsequently, moving beyond primary text content, we integrate richer side information of candidate results, including signals modeling visual content generated by the VLM-based evaluator. These comprehensive signals are then processed alongside carefully designed re-ranking principle that considers multiple facets, including content relevance and quality, information gain, information novelty, and the visual presentation of cover images. Then, the LLM-based re-ranker performs the holistic evaluation based on these principles and integrated signals. To enhance the scenario adaptability of the VLM-based evaluator and the LLM-based re-ranker, we further enhance their capabilities through multi-task reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

We propose OPUS (Optimizer-induced Projected Utility Selection), a dynamic data selection framework that defines utility in the optimizer-induced update space. OPUS scores candidates by projecting their effective updates, shaped by modern optimizers, onto a target direction derived from a stable, in-distribution proxy. To ensure scalability, we employ Ghost technique with CountSketch for computational efficiency, and Boltzmann sampling for data diversity, incurring only 4.7\\% additional compute overhead. OPUS achieves remarkable results across diverse corpora, quality tiers, optimizers, and model scales. In pre-training of GPT-2 Large/XL on FineWeb and FineWeb-Edu with 30B tokens, OPUS outperforms industrial-level baselines and even full 200B-token training. Moreover, when combined with industrial-level static filters, OPUS further improves pre-training efficiency, even with lower-quality data. Furthermore, in continued pre-training of Qwen3-8B-Base on SciencePedia, OPUS achieves superior performance using only 0.5B tokens compared to full training with 3B tokens, demonstrating significant data efficiency gains in specialized domains.",

      "abstract": "Integral field spectroscopy (IFS) provides spatially resolved spectra, enabling detailed studies that address the physical and kinematic properties of the interstellar medium. A critical step in analyzing IFS data is the decomposition of emission lines, where different velocity components are often modeled with Gaussian profiles. However, conventional fitting methods that treat each spectrum independently often yield spatial discontinuities in the fitting results. Here, we present Emission Line Fitting Optimization (ELFO), a Python package for IFS spectral fitting. ELFO uses the results of neighboring spectra to determine multiple initial guesses and selects the result that exhibits spatial smoothness. We tested ELFO on IFS data of two quasars obtained from the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer, where it successfully corrected anomalous fits, revealed previously unresolved substructures, and made large-scale kinematic structures more evident. With minor modifications, this method can also be easily adapted to other IFS data and different emission lines.",

      "abstract": "A simple strategy for improving LLM accuracy, especially in math and reasoning problems, is to sample multiple responses and submit the answer most consistently reached. In this paper we leverage Bayesian prior information to save on sampling costs, stopping once sufficient consistency is reached. Although the exact posterior is computationally intractable, we further introduce an efficient \"L-aggregated\" stopping policy that tracks only the L-1 most frequent answer counts. Theoretically, we prove that L=3 is all you need: this coarse approximation is sufficient to achieve asymptotic optimality, and strictly dominates prior-free baselines, while having a fast posterior computation. Empirically, this identifies the most consistent (i.e., mode) LLM answer using fewer samples, and can achieve similar answer accuracy while cutting the number of LLM calls (i.e., saving on LLM inference costs) by up to 50%.",

      "abstract": "As Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve remarkable empirical success through scaling model and data size, pretraining has become increasingly critical yet computationally prohibitive, hindering rapid development. Despite the availability of numerous pretrained LLMs developed at significant computational expense, a fundamental real-world question remains underexplored: \\textit{Can we leverage existing small pretrained models to accelerate the training of larger models?} In this paper, we propose a Late-to-Early Training (LET) paradigm that enables LLMs to explicitly learn later knowledge in earlier steps and earlier layers. The core idea is to guide the early layers of an LLM during early training using representations from the late layers of a pretrained (i.e. late training phase) model. We identify two key mechanisms that drive LET's effectiveness: late-to-early-step learning and late-to-early-layer learning. These mechanisms significantly accelerate training convergence while robustly enhancing both language modeling capabilities and downstream task performance, enabling faster training with superior performance. Extensive experiments on 1.4B and 7B parameter models demonstrate LET's efficiency and effectiveness. Notably, when training a 1.4B LLM on the Pile dataset, our method achieves up to 1.6$\\times$ speedup with nearly 5\\% improvement in downstream task accuracy compared to standard training, even when using a pretrained model with 10$\\times$ fewer parameters than the target model.",

      "abstract": "Dataset distillation seeks to synthesize a highly compact dataset that achieves performance comparable to the original dataset on downstream tasks. For the classification task that use pre-trained self-supervised models as backbones, previous linear gradient matching optimizes synthetic images by encouraging them to mimic the gradient updates induced by real images on the linear classifier. However, this batch-level formulation requires loading thousands of real images and applying multiple rounds of differentiable augmentations to synthetic images at each distillation step, leading to substantial computational and memory overhead. In this paper, we introduce statistical flow matching , a stable and efficient supervised learning framework that optimizes synthetic images by aligning constant statistical flows from target class centers to non-target class centers in the original data. Our approach loads raw statistics only once and performs a single augmentation pass on the synthetic data, achieving performance comparable to or better than the state-of-the-art methods with 10x lower GPU memory usage and 4x shorter runtime. Furthermore, we propose a classifier inheritance strategy that reuses the classifier trained on the original dataset for inference, requiring only an extremely lightweight linear projector and marginal storage while achieving substantial performance gains.",

To address these limitations, we propose DecompSSM, an end-to-end decomposition framework using three parallel deep state space model branches to capture trend, seasonal, and residual components. The model features adaptive temporal scales via an input-dependent predictor, a refinement module for shared cross-variable context, and an auxiliary loss that enforces reconstruction and orthogonality. Across standard benchmarks (ECL, Weather, ETTm2, and PEMS04), DecompSSM outperformed strong baselines, indicating the effectiveness of combining component-wise deep state space models and global context refinement.",

Although current methods perform well on benchmarks like BIRD and Spider, they struggle with complex reasoning, domain knowledge, and hypothetical queries, and remain costly in enterprise deployment. To address these issues, we propose a framework named IESR(Information Enhanced Structured Reasoning) for lightweight large language models: (i) leverages LLMs for key information understanding and schema linking, and decoupling mathematical computation and SQL generation, (ii) integrates a multi-path reasoning mechanism based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with majority voting, and (iii) introduces a trajectory consistency verification module with a discriminator model to ensure accuracy and consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that IESR achieves state-of-the-art performance on the complex reasoning benchmark LogicCat (24.28 EX) and the Archer dataset (37.28 EX) using only compact lightweight models without fine-tuning. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that current coder models exhibit notable biases and deficiencies in physical knowledge, mathematical computation, and common-sense reasoning, highlighting important directions for future research.

This study evaluated four small medical LLMs Meerkat-7B, BioMistral-7B, OpenBioLLM-8B, and MedLLaMA3-v20 in answering ophthalmology related patient queries and assessed the feasibility of LLM based evaluation against clinician grading. In this cross sectional study, 180 ophthalmology patient queries were answered by each model, generating 2160 responses. Models were selected for parameter sizes under 10 billion to enable resource efficient deployment. Responses were evaluated by three ophthalmologists of differing seniority and by GPT-4-Turbo using the S.C.O.R.E. framework assessing safety, consensus and context, objectivity, reproducibility, and explainability, with ratings assigned on a five point Likert scale. Agreement between LLM and clinician grading was assessed using Spearman rank correlation, Kendall tau statistics, and kernel density estimate analyses. Meerkat-7B achieved the highest performance with mean scores of 3.44 from Senior Consultants, 4.08 from Consultants, and 4.18 from Residents. MedLLaMA3-v20 performed poorest, with 25.5 percent of responses containing hallucinations or clinically misleading content, including fabricated terminology. GPT-4-Turbo grading showed strong alignment with clinician assessments overall, with Spearman rho of 0.80 and Kendall tau of 0.67, though Senior Consultants graded more conservatively. Overall, medical LLMs demonstrated potential for safe ophthalmic question answering, but gaps remained in clinical depth and consensus, supporting the feasibility of LLM based evaluation for large scale benchmarking and the need for hybrid automated and clinician review frameworks to guide safe clinical deployment.",

Starting from a minimal seed set of human-annotated preference pairs, SAIL operates in a closed-loop manner where the model progressively generates diverse samples, self-annotates preferences based on its evolving understanding, and refines itself using this self-augmented dataset. To ensure robust learning and prevent catastrophic forgetting, we introduce a ranked preference mixup strategy that carefully balances exploration with adherence to initial human priors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SAIL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks while using merely 6\\% of the preference data required by existing approaches, revealing that diffusion models possess remarkable self-improvement capabilities that, when properly harnessed, can effectively replace both large-scale human annotation and external reward models.",

We refer to this discrepancy as superficial forgetting. Recent studies indicate that most existing unlearning approaches primarily alter the final classifier, leaving intermediate representations largely unchanged and highly similar to those of the original model. To address this limitation, we introduce the Erase at the Core (EC), a framework designed to enforce forgetting throughout the entire network hierarchy. EC integrates multi-layer contrastive unlearning on the forget set with retain set preservation through deeply supervised learning. Concretely, EC attaches auxiliary modules to intermediate layers and applies both contrastive unlearning and cross-entropy losses at each supervision point, with layer-wise weighted losses. Experimental results show that EC not only achieves effective logit-level forgetting, but also substantially reduces representational similarity to the original model across intermediate layers. Furthermore, EC is model-agnostic and can be incorporated as a plug-in module into existing unlearning methods, improving representation-level forgetting while maintaining performance on the retain set.",

In this study, we conduct a cross-lingual empirical analysis of LLM performance on Arabic and English medical question and answering.

In this paper, we challenge this scaling hypothesis and reveal a counter-intuitive phenomenon: in mathematical reasoning, aggressive exploration yields diminishing returns and even catastrophic policy collapse. We theoretically demonstrate that scaling $N$ amplifies verifier noise and induces detrimental distribution shifts. To resolve this, we introduce \\textbf{PACE} (Proximal Alignment via Corrective Exploration), which replaces brute-force mining with a generation-based corrective strategy. Operating with a minimal budget ($2<N<3$), PACE synthesizes high-fidelity preference pairs from failed explorations.

Residual binarization enables hardware-friendly, matmul-free inference by stacking binary ($\\pm$1) layers, but is plagued by pathological feature co-adaptation. We identify a key failure mode, which we term inter-path adaptation: during quantization-aware training (QAT), parallel residual binary paths learn redundant features, degrading the error-compensation structure and limiting the expressive capacity of the model. While prior work relies on heuristic workarounds (e.g., path freezing) that constrain the solution space, we propose RaBiT, a novel quantization framework that resolves co-adaptation by algorithmically enforcing a residual hierarchy. Its core mechanism sequentially derives each binary path from a single shared full-precision weight, which ensures that every path corrects the error of the preceding one. This process is stabilized by a robust initialization that prioritizes functional preservation over mere weight approximation. RaBiT redefines the 2-bit accuracy-efficiency frontier: it achieves state-of-the-art performance, rivals even hardware-intensive Vector Quantization (VQ) methods, and delivers a $4.49\\times$ inference speed-up over full-precision models on an RTX 4090.",

In this paper, we identify three fundamental challenges that limit the effectiveness of this paradigm: (i) the incompleteness and structural inconsistency of tool documentation; (ii) the significant semantic and granular mismatch between user queries and technical tool documents; and, most importantly, (iii) the multi-aspect nature of tool utility, that involves distinct dimensions, such as functionality, input constraints, and output formats, varying in format and importance. To address these challenges, we introduce Multi-Field Tool Retrieval, a framework designed to align user intent with tool representations through fine-grained, multi-field modeling.

How to adaptively determine proper neighborhood scopes for the aggregation process for both homophilic and heterophilic graphs remains largely unexplored. We thus propose to model the GNNs' message-passing behavior on a graph as a stochastic process by treating the number of hops as a beta process. This Bayesian framework allows us to infer the most plausible neighborhood scope for message aggregation simultaneously with the optimization of GNN parameters. Our theoretical analysis shows that the scope inference improves the expressivity of a GNN.

      "abstract": "Second-order variational properties have been shown to play important theoretical and numerical roles for different classes of optimization problems. Among such properties, twice epi-differentiability has a special place because of its ubiquitous presence in various classes of extended-real-valued functions that are important for optimization problems. We provide a useful characterization of this property for spectral functions by demonstrating that it can be characterized via the same property of the symmetric part of the spectral representation of an eigenvalue function. Our approach allows us to bypass the rather restrictive convexity assumption, used in many recent works that targeted second-order variational properties of spectral functions. By this theoretical tool, several applications on the proto-differentiability of subgradient mappings, the directional differentiability of the proximal mapping of spectral functions are achieved. We finally use our established theory to study twice epi-differentiability of leading eigenvalue functions and practical regularization terms that have important applications in statistics and the robust PCA.",

      "abstract": "Large Language Models have shown strong capabilities in complex problem solving, yet many agentic systems remain difficult to interpret and control due to opaque internal workflows. While some frameworks offer explicit architectures for collaboration, many deployed agentic systems operate as black boxes to users. We address this by introducing Agentic Workflow Reconstruction (AWR), a new task aiming to synthesize an explicit, interpretable stand-in workflow that approximates a black-box system using only input--output access. We propose AgentXRay, a search-based framework that formulates AWR as a combinatorial optimization problem over discrete agent roles and tool invocations in a chain-structured workflow space. Unlike model distillation, AgentXRay produces editable white-box workflows that match target outputs under an observable, output-based proxy metric, without accessing model parameters. To navigate the vast search space, AgentXRay employs Monte Carlo Tree Search enhanced by a scoring-based Red-Black Pruning mechanism, which dynamically integrates proxy quality with search depth. Experiments across diverse domains demonstrate that AgentXRay achieves higher proxy similarity and reduces token consumption compared to unpruned search, enabling deeper workflow exploration under fixed iteration budgets.",

We introduce two types of networks, FD-CON and FE-CON, which use residual-based loss functions derived from the corresponding numerical methods. We derive error estimates for FD-CON and FE-CON using finite difference and finite element analysis. These estimates show a direct relation between the convergence behavior and the decay rate of the training loss. From these analyses, we establish training strategies that guarantee optimal convergence rates under grid refinement.

      "abstract": "We consider the sequential experimental design problem in the predict-then-optimize paradigm. In this paradigm, the outputs of the prediction model are used as coefficient vectors in a downstream linear optimization problem. Traditional sequential experimental design aims to control the input variables (features) so that the improvement in prediction accuracy from each experimental outcome (label) is maximized. However, in the predict-then-optimize setting, performance is ultimately evaluated based on the decision loss induced by the downstream optimization, rather than by prediction error. This mismatch between prediction accuracy and decision loss renders traditional decision-blind designs inefficient. To address this issue, we propose a directional-based metric to quantify predictive uncertainty. This metric does not require solving an optimization oracle and is therefore computationally tractable. We show that the resulting sequential design criterion enjoys strong consistency and convergence guarantees. Under a broad class of distributions, we demonstrate that our directional uncertainty-based design attains an earlier stopping time than decision-blind designs. This advantage is further supported by real-world experiments on an LLM job allocation problem.",

      "abstract": "With the increasing versatility of text-to-image diffusion models, the ability to selectively erase undesirable concepts (e.g., harmful content) has become indispensable. However, existing concept erasure approaches primarily focus on removing unsafe concepts without providing guidance toward corresponding safe alternatives, which often leads to failure in preserving the structural and semantic consistency between the original and erased generations. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, PAIRed Erasing (PAIR), which reframes concept erasure from simple removal to consistency-preserving semantic realignment using unsafe-safe pairs. We first generate safe counterparts from unsafe inputs while preserving structural and semantic fidelity, forming paired unsafe-safe multimodal data. Leveraging these pairs, we introduce two key components: (1) Paired Semantic Realignment, a guided objective that uses unsafe-safe pairs to explicitly map target concepts to semantically aligned safe anchors; and (2) Fisher-weighted Initialization for DoRA, which initializes parameter-efficient low-rank adaptation matrices using unsafe-safe pairs, encouraging the generation of safe alternatives while selectively suppressing unsafe concepts. Together, these components enable fine-grained erasure that removes only the targeted concepts while maintaining overall semantic consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving effective concept erasure while preserving structural integrity, semantic coherence, and generation quality.",

The proposed framework reformulates pool-based AL as a noisy lossy compression problem by mapping pool observations to noisy symbol observations, data selection to compression, and learning to decoding. This correspondence enables a unified information-theoretic analysis of data selection and learning in pool-based AL. Applying finite blocklength analysis of noisy lossy compression, we derive information-theoretic lower bounds on label complexity and generalization error that serve as theoretical limits for a given learning algorithm under its associated optimal data selection strategy. Specifically, our bounds include terms that reflect overfitting induced by the learning algorithm and the discrepancy between its inductive bias and the target task, and are closely related to established information-theoretic bounds and stability theory, which have not been previously applied to the analysis of pool-based AL. These properties yield a new theoretical perspective on pool-based AL.",

      "abstract": "Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve strong performance by producing long chains of thought, but their inference costs are high and often generate redundant reasoning. Small language models (SLMs) are far more efficient, yet struggle on multi-step reasoning tasks. A natural idea is to let a large model guide a small one at inference time as a mentor, yet existing collaboration methods often promote imitation, resulting in verbose reasoning without consistent error correction. We propose MentorCollab, an inference-time collaboration method in which an LRM selectively and sparsely guides an SLM, rather than taking over generation. At randomly sampled token positions, we probe for divergences between the two models and use a lightweight verifier to decide whether the SLM should follow a short lookahead segment from its mentor or continue on its own. Across 15 SLM--LRM pairs and 3 domains (math reasoning, general knowledge, and commonsense reasoning), our method improves performance in 12 settings, with average gains of 3.0% and up to 8.0%, while adopting only having 18.4% tokens generated by the expensive mentor model on average. We find that short segments and selective probing are sufficient for effective collaboration. Our results show that selective inference-time guidance restores large-model reasoning ability without substantial inference overhead.",

Despite their popularity, existing analyses for these algorithms are disparate, relying on different proof techniques tailored to each method. Furthermore, the original proof of SAG is known to be notoriously involved, requiring computer-aided analysis. Focusing on finite-sum optimization with smooth and strongly convex objective functions, our main contribution is to develop a single unified convergence analysis that applies to all three algorithms: SAG, SAGA, and IAG. Our analysis features two key steps: (i) establishing a bound on delays due to stochastic sub-sampling using simple concentration tools, and (ii) carefully designing a novel Lyapunov function that accounts for such delays. The resulting proof is short and modular, providing the first high-probability bounds for SAG and SAGA that can be seamlessly extended to non-convex objectives and Markov sampling. As an immediate byproduct of our new analysis technique, we obtain the best known rates for the IAG algorithm, significantly improving upon prior bounds.",

To do so, we introduce PieArena, a large-scale negotiation benchmark grounded in multi-agent interactions over realistic scenarios drawn from an MBA negotiation course at an elite business school. We find systematic evidence of AGI-level performance in which a representative frontier agent (GPT-5) matches or outperforms trained business-school students, despite a semester of general negotiation instruction and targeted coaching immediately prior to the task. We further study the effects of joint-intentionality agentic scaffolding and find asymmetric gains, with large improvements for mid- and lower-tier LMs and diminishing returns for frontier LMs. Beyond deal outcomes, PieArena provides a multi-dimensional negotiation behavioral profile, revealing novel cross-model heterogeneity, masked by deal-outcome-only benchmarks, in deception, computation accuracy, instruction compliance, and perceived reputation. Overall, our results suggest that frontier language agents are already intellectually and psychologically capable of deployment in high-stakes economic settings, but deficiencies in robustness and trustworthiness remain open challenges.",

We show that for large-scale language model training, the answer is yes: by exploiting the power-law structure of language data, one can design time-varying schedules for $(β_1, β_2, λ)$ that deliver substantial performance gains.   We study logarithmic-time scheduling, in which the optimizer's gradient memory horizon grows with training time. Although naive variants of this are unstable, we show that suitable damping mechanisms restore stability while preserving the benefits of longer memory. Based on this, we present ADANA, an AdamW-like optimizer that couples log-time schedules with explicit damping to balance stability and performance. We empirically evaluate ADANA across transformer scalings (45M to 2.6B parameters), comparing against AdamW, Muon, and AdEMAMix.   When properly tuned, ADANA achieves up to 40% compute efficiency relative to a tuned AdamW, with gains that persist--and even improve--as model scale increases. We further show that similar benefits arise when applying logarithmic-time scheduling to AdEMAMix, and that logarithmic-time weight-decay alone can yield significant improvements. Finally, we present variants of ADANA that mitigate potential failure modes and improve robustness.",

This coarse-to-fine training paradigm begins with extensive continue pretraining to restore multimodal understanding and generation capabilities, progresses to large-scale contrastive pretraining and hard negative mining to enhance discriminative power, and culminates in a task-aware fine-tuning stage guided by an MLLM-as-a-Judge for precise data curation.

Traditional methods often utilize a frozen pre-trained feature extractor to generate static class prototypes, which suffer from the inherent representation bias of the backbone. While recent prompt-based tuning methods attempt to adapt the backbone via minimal parameter updates, given the constraint of extreme data scarcity, the model's capacity to assimilate novel information and substantively enhance its global discriminative power is inherently limited. In this paper, we propose a novel shift in perspective: freezing the feature extractor while fine-tuning the prototypes. We argue that the primary challenge in FSCIL is not feature acquisition, but rather the optimization of decision regions within a static, high-quality feature space. To this end, we introduce an efficient prototype fine-tuning framework that evolves static centroids into dynamic, learnable components. The framework employs a dual-calibration method consisting of class-specific and task-aware offsets. These components function synergistically to improve the discriminative capacity of prototypes for ongoing incremental classes. Extensive results demonstrate that our method attains superior performance across multiple benchmarks while requiring minimal learnable parameters.",

We advance this theoretical underpinning by deriving a tighter upper bound for the dot product than the classical Cauchy-Schwarz bound. This new bound leads directly to recos, a similarity metric that normalizes the dot product by the sorted vector components. recos relaxes the condition for perfect similarity from strict linear dependence to ordinal concordance, thereby capturing a broader class of relationships. Extensive experiments across 11 embedding models--spanning static, contextualized, and universal types--demonstrate that recos consistently outperforms traditional cosine similarity, achieving higher correlation with human judgments on standard Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) benchmarks.

      "abstract": "Large-scale multimodal pre-trained models like CLIP rely heavily on high-quality training data, yet raw web-crawled datasets are often noisy, misaligned, and redundant, leading to inefficient training and suboptimal generalization. Existing data selection methods are either heuristic-based, suffering from bias and limited diversity, or data-driven but task-agnostic, failing to optimize for multi-task scenarios. To address these gaps, we introduce TADS (Task-Aware Data Selection), a novel framework for multi-task multimodal pre-training that integrates Intrinsic Quality, Task Relevance, and Distributional Diversity into a learnable value function. TADS employs a comprehensive quality assessment system with unimodal and cross-modal operators, quantifies task relevance via interpretable similarity vectors, and optimizes diversity through cluster-based weighting. A feedback-driven meta-learning mechanism adaptively refines the selection strategy based on proxy model performance across multiple downstream tasks. Experiments on CC12M demonstrate that TADS achieves superior zero-shot performance on benchmarks like ImageNet, CIFAR-100, MS-COCO, and Flickr30K, using only 36% of the data while outperforming baselines by an average of 1.0%. This highlights that TADS significantly enhances data efficiency by curating a high-utility subset that yields a much higher performance ceiling within the same computational constraints.",

      "abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by grounding generation in external knowledge to improve factuality and reduce hallucinations. Yet most deployments assume a centralized corpus, which is infeasible in privacy aware domains where knowledge remains siloed. This motivates federated RAG (FedRAG), where a central LLM server collaborates with distributed silos without sharing raw documents. In context RAG violates this requirement by transmitting verbatim documents, whereas parametric RAG encodes documents into lightweight adapters that merge with a frozen LLM at inference, avoiding raw-text exchange. We adopt the parametric approach but face two unique challenges induced by FedRAG: high storage and communication from per-document adapters, and destructive aggregation caused by indiscriminately merging multiple adapters. We present FedMosaic, the first federated RAG framework built on parametric adapters. FedMosaic clusters semantically related documents into multi-document adapters with document-specific masks to reduce overhead while preserving specificity, and performs selective adapter aggregation to combine only relevance-aligned, nonconflicting adapters. Experiments show that FedMosaic achieves an average 10.9% higher accuracy than state-of-the-art methods in four categories, while lowering storage costs by 78.8% to 86.3% and communication costs by 91.4%, and never sharing raw documents.",

Despite recent advancements using graph neural networks (GNNs), two major challenges persist. At the model level, most methods adopt a transductive learning paradigm, which assumes static graph structures, making them unsuitable for dynamic, evolving networks. At the data level, the extreme class imbalance, where anomalous nodes are rare, leads to biased models that fail to generalize to unseen anomalies. These challenges are interdependent: static transductive frameworks limit effective data augmentation, while imbalance exacerbates model distortion in inductive learning settings. To address these challenges, we propose a novel data-centric framework that integrates dynamic graph modeling with balanced anomaly synthesis. Our framework features: (1) a discrete ego-graph diffusion model, which captures the local topology of anomalies to generate ego-graphs aligned with anomalous structural distribution, and (2) a curriculum anomaly augmentation mechanism, which dynamically adjusts synthetic data generation during training, focusing on underrepresented anomaly patterns to improve detection and generalization. Experiments on five datasets demonstrate that the effectiveness of our framework.",

We identify two fundamental limitations affecting these approaches: the restriction to convex combinations that only permits additive information blending, and uniform accumulated weight bias that dilutes attention in long contexts. We propose Zero-Sum Linear Attention (ZeroS), which addresses these limitations by removing the constant zero-order term $1/t$ and reweighting the remaining zero-sum softmax residuals. This modification creates mathematically stable weights, enabling both positive and negative values and allowing a single attention layer to perform contrastive operations. While maintaining $O(N)$ complexity, ZeroS theoretically expands the set of representable functions compared to convex combinations. Empirically, it matches or exceeds standard softmax attention across various sequence modeling benchmarks.",

      "abstract": "Harmful fine-tuning can invalidate safety alignment of large language models, exposing significant safety risks. In this paper, we utilize the attention sink mechanism to mitigate harmful fine-tuning. Specifically, we first measure a statistic named \\emph{sink divergence} for each attention head and observe that \\emph{different attention heads exhibit two different signs of sink divergence}. To understand its safety implications, we conduct experiments and find that the number of attention heads of positive sink divergence increases along with the increase of the model's harmfulness when undergoing harmful fine-tuning. Based on this finding, we propose a separable sink divergence hypothesis -- \\emph{attention heads associating with learning harmful patterns during fine-tuning are separable by their sign of sink divergence}. Based on the hypothesis, we propose a fine-tuning-stage defense, dubbed Surgery. Surgery utilizes a regularizer for sink divergence suppression, which steers attention heads toward the negative sink divergence group, thereby reducing the model's tendency to learn and amplify harmful patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Surgery improves defense performance by 5.90\\%, 11.25\\%, and 9.55\\% on the BeaverTails, HarmBench, and SorryBench benchmarks, respectively.

These SAM-based methods typically rely on point matching between reference and target images and use the matched dense points as prompts for mask prediction. However, we observe that dense points perform poorly in Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation (CD-FSS), where target images are from medical or satellite domains. We attribute this issue to large domain shifts that disrupt the point-image interactions learned by SAM, and find that point density plays a crucial role under such conditions. To address this challenge, we propose Conditional Point Sparsification (CPS), a training-free approach that adaptively guides SAM interactions for cross-domain images based on reference exemplars. Leveraging ground-truth masks, the reference images provide reliable guidance for adaptively sparsifying dense matched points, enabling more accurate segmentation results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CPS outperforms existing training-free SAM-based methods across diverse CD-FSS datasets.",

While semantic search has seen rapid progress, its behavior on large, highly technical corpora such as research-level mathematical theorems remains poorly understood. In this work, we introduce and study semantic theorem retrieval at scale over a unified corpus of $9.2$ million theorem statements extracted from arXiv and seven other sources, representing the largest publicly available corpus of human-authored, research-level theorems. We represent each theorem with a short natural-language description as a retrieval representation and systematically analyze how representation context, language model choice, embedding model, and prompting strategy affect retrieval quality. On a curated evaluation set of theorem-search queries written by professional mathematicians, our approach substantially improves both theorem-level and paper-level retrieval compared to existing baselines, demonstrating that semantic theorem search is feasible and effective at web scale.

      "abstract": "The academia and industry are characterized by a reciprocal shaping and dynamic feedback mechanism. Despite distinct institutional logics, they have adapted closely in collaborative publishing and talent mobility, demonstrating tension between institutional divergence and intensive collaboration. Existing studies on their knowledge proximity mainly rely on macro indicators such as the number of collaborative papers or patents, lacking an analysis of knowledge units in the literature. This has led to an insufficient grasp of fine-grained knowledge proximity between industry and academia, potentially undermining collaboration frameworks and resource allocation efficiency. To remedy the limitation, this study quantifies the trajectory of academia-industry co-evolution through fine-grained entities and semantic space. In the entity measurement part, we extract fine-grained knowledge entities via pre-trained models, measure sequence overlaps using cosine similarity, and analyze topological features through complex network analysis. At the semantic level, we employ unsupervised contrastive learning to quantify convergence in semantic spaces by measuring cross-institutional textual similarities. Finally, we use citation distribution patterns to examine correlations between bidirectional knowledge flows and similarity. Analysis reveals that knowledge proximity between academia and industry rises, particularly following technological change. This provides textual evidence of bidirectional adaptation in co-evolution. Additionally, academia's knowledge dominance weakens during technological paradigm shifts.

Recent research has paid increasing attention to the question of what reference documents to link to outputs. However, how LLMs recognize cite-worthiness and how this process should be controlled remains underexplored. In this study, we focus on what kinds of content LLMs currently tend to cite and how well that behavior aligns with human preferences. We construct a dataset to characterize the relationship between human citation preferences and LLM behavior. Web-derived texts are categorized into eight citation-motivation types, and pairwise citation preferences are exhaustively evaluated across all type combinations to capture fine-grained contrasts. Our results show that humans most frequently seek citations for medical text, and stronger models display a similar tendency. We also find that current models are as much as $27\\%$ more likely than humans to add citations to text that is explicitly marked as needing citations on sources such as Wikipedia, and this overemphasis reduces alignment accuracy. Conversely, models systematically underselect numeric sentences (by $-22.6\\%$ relative to humans) and sentences containing personal names (by $-20.1\\%$), categories for which humans typically demand citations. Furthermore, experiments with Direct Preference Optimization demonstrate that model behavior can be calibrated to better match human citation preferences.

We propose a fundamentally different approach: repurposing video generative models, which are inherently designed to model temporal structure, as reward models. We present the Generative-Transformer-based Self-Supervised Video Judge (\\modelname), a novel evaluation model that transforms state-of-the-art video generation models into powerful temporally-aware reward models. Our key insight is that generative models can be reformulated as energy-based models (EBMs) that assign low energy to high-quality videos and high energy to degraded ones, enabling them to discriminate video quality with remarkable precision when trained via contrastive objectives. To prevent the model from exploiting superficial differences between real and generated videos, we design challenging synthetic negative videos through controlled latent-space perturbations: temporal slicing, feature swapping, and frame shuffling, which simulate realistic but subtle visual degradations. This forces the model to learn meaningful spatiotemporal features rather than trivial artifacts. \\modelname achieves state-of-the-art performance on GenAI-Bench and MonteBench using only 30K human-annotations: $6\\times$ to $65\\times$ fewer than existing VLM-based approaches.",

Extensive experiments with 7 collaboration strategies and 15 tasks (QA, reasoning, factuality, etc.) demonstrate that: 1) individual models improve by 8.0% on average, absorbing the strengths of collaboration while reducing the cost to a single model; 2) the collaboration also benefits from the stronger and more synergistic LMs after distillation, improving over initial systems without evolution by 14.9% on average.

In our experiments, ShapePuri achieves $84.06\\%$ clean accuracy and $81.64\\%$ robust accuracy under the AutoAttack protocol, representing the first defense framework to surpass the $80\\%$ threshold on this benchmark. Our approach provides a scalable and efficient adversarial defense that preserves prediction stability during inference without requiring auxiliary modules or additional computational cost.",

      "abstract": "Riemannian flow matching (RFM) extends flow-based generative modeling to data supported on manifolds by learning a time-dependent tangent vector field whose flow-ODE transports a simple base distribution to the data law. We develop a nonasymptotic Total Variation (TV) convergence analysis for RFM samplers that use a learned vector field together with Euler discretization on manifolds. Our key technical ingredient is a differential inequality governing the evolution of TV between two manifold ODE flows, which expresses the time-derivative of TV through the divergence of the vector-field mismatch and the score of the reference flow; controlling these terms requires establishing new bounds that explicitly account for parallel transport and curvature. Under smoothness assumptions on the population flow-matching field and either uniform (compact manifolds) or mean-square (Hadamard manifolds) approximation guarantees for the learned field, we obtain explicit bounds of the form $\\mathrm{TV}\\le C_{\\mathrm{Lip}}\\,h + C_{\\varepsilon}\\,\\varepsilon$ (with an additional higher-order $\\varepsilon^2$ term on compact manifolds), cleanly separating numerical discretization and learning errors. Here, $h$ is the step-size and $\\varepsilon$ is the target accuracy.

While effective, these approaches are inherently stateless: adaptations are recomputed for each query and discarded thereafter, precluding cumulative learning and repeatedly incurring inference-time cost. Index-side approaches like key expansion introduce persistence but rely on offline preprocessing or heuristic updates that are weakly aligned with downstream task utility, leading to semantic drift and noise accumulation. We propose Evolving Retrieval Memory (ERM), a training-free framework that transforms transient query-time gains into persistent retrieval improvements. ERM updates the retrieval index through correctness-gated feedback, selectively attributes atomic expansion signals to the document keys they benefit, and progressively evolves keys via stable, norm-bounded updates. We show that query and key expansion are theoretically equivalent under standard similarity functions and prove convergence of ERM's selective updates, amortizing optimal query expansion into a stable index with zero inference-time overhead. Experiments on BEIR and BRIGHT across 13 domains demonstrate consistent gains in retrieval and generation, particularly on reasoning-intensive tasks, at native retrieval speed.",

Most existing approaches, such as LoRA and PiSSA, rely on low-rank decompositions of weight updates. However, the low-rank assumption may restrict expressivity, particularly in task-specific adaptation scenarios where singular values are distributed relatively uniformly. To address this limitation, we propose CoSA (Compressed Sensing-Based Adaptation), a new PEFT method extended from compressed sensing theory. Instead of constraining weight updates to a low-rank subspace, CoSA expresses them through fixed random projection matrices and a compact learnable core. We provide a formal theoretical analysis of CoSA as a synthesis process, proving that weight updates can be compactly encoded into a low-dimensional space and mapped back through random projections. Extensive experimental results show that CoSA provides a principled perspective for efficient and expressive multi-scale model adaptation. Specifically, we evaluate CoSA on 10 diverse tasks, including natural language understanding and generation, employing 5 models of different scales from RoBERTa, Llama, and Qwen families. Across these settings, CoSA consistently matches or outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT methods.",

TIDE exploits heterogeneous clusters by mapping decoupled inference and training to appropriate GPU classes.

      "abstract": "Machine learning systems are often trained and evaluated for fairness on historical data, yet deployed in environments where conditions have shifted. A particularly common form of shift occurs when the prevalence of positive outcomes changes differently across demographic groups--for example, when disease rates rise faster in one population than another, or when economic conditions affect loan default rates unequally. We study group-conditional prior probability shift (GPPS), where the label prevalence $P(Y=1\\mid A=a)$ may change between training and deployment while the feature-generation process $P(X\\mid Y,A)$ remains stable. Our analysis yields three main contributions. First, we prove a fundamental dichotomy: fairness criteria based on error rates (equalized odds) are structurally invariant under GPPS, while acceptance-rate criteria (demographic parity) can drift--and we prove this drift is unavoidable for non-trivial classifiers (shift-robust impossibility). Second, we show that target-domain risk and fairness metrics are identifiable without target labels: the invariance of ROC quantities under GPPS enables consistent estimation from source labels and unlabeled target data alone, with finite-sample guarantees. Third, we propose TAP-GPPS, a label-free post-processing algorithm that estimates prevalences from unlabeled data, corrects posteriors, and selects thresholds to satisfy demographic parity in the target domain. Experiments validate our theoretical predictions and demonstrate that TAP-GPPS achieves target fairness with minimal utility loss.",

However, existing graph-based methods often over-rely on surface-level node matching and lack explicit causal modeling, leading to unfaithful or spurious answers. Prior attempts to incorporate causality are typically limited to local or single-document contexts and also suffer from information isolation that arises from modular graph structures, which hinders scalability and cross-module causal reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose HugRAG, a framework that rethinks knowledge organization for graph-based RAG through causal gating across hierarchical modules. HugRAG explicitly models causal relationships to suppress spurious correlations while enabling scalable reasoning over large-scale knowledge graphs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HugRAG consistently outperforms competitive graph-based RAG baselines across multiple datasets and evaluation metrics.

These implicitly track latent states and disambiguate state-dependent reward patterns.

However, currently, the specific demands that arise while using conversational agents for health information seeking, and the strategies people use to cope with those demands, remain unknown. To address these gaps, we conducted a think-aloud study with 15 participants as they sought health information using our off-the-shelf AI conversational agent.

In practice it is common for language technology engineers to 'fiddle' with the LLM temperature setting and hope that what comes out the other end improves the downstream model. Faced with this uncertainty, here we propose Data Kernel Perspective Space (DKPS) to provide the foundation for mathematical analysis yielding concrete statistical guarantees for the quality of the outputs of transformer models. We first show the mathematical derivation of DKPS and how it provides performance guarantees. Next we show how DKPS performance guarantees can elucidate performance of a downstream task, such as neural machine translation models or LLMs trained using Contrastive Preference Optimization (CPO).

We discuss two major variants of Locas: one with a conventional two-layer MLP design that has a clearer theoretical guarantee; the other one shares the same GLU-FFN structure with SOTA LLMs, and can be easily attached to existing models for both parameter-efficient and computation-efficient continual learning. Crucially, we show that proper initialization of such low-rank sideway-FFN-style memories -- performed in a principled way by reusing model parameters, activations and/or gradients -- is essential for fast convergence, improved generalization, and catastrophic forgetting prevention. We validate the proposed memory mechanism on the PG-19 whole-book language modeling and LoCoMo long-context dialogue question answering tasks. With only 0.02\\% additional parameters in the lowest case, Locas-GLU is capable of storing the information from past context while maintaining a much smaller context window. In addition, we also test the model's general capability loss after memorizing the whole book with Locas, through comparative MMLU evaluation. Results show the promising ability of Locas to permanentize past context into parametric knowledge with minimized catastrophic forgetting of the model's existing internal knowledge.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, explaining decisions made by complex machine learning models has become essential in high-stakes domains such as energy systems, healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems. However, the reliability of these explanations, namely, whether they remain stable and consistent under realistic, non-adversarial changes, remains largely unmeasured. Widely used methods such as SHAP and Integrated Gradients (IG) are well-motivated by axiomatic notions of attribution, yet their explanations can vary substantially even under system-level conditions, including small input perturbations, correlated representations, and minor model updates. Such variability undermines explanation reliability, as reliable explanations should remain consistent across equivalent input representations and small, performance-preserving model changes. We introduce the Explanation Reliability Index (ERI), a family of metrics that quantifies explanation stability under four reliability axioms: robustness to small input perturbations, consistency under feature redundancy, smoothness across model evolution, and resilience to mild distributional shifts. For each axiom, we derive formal guarantees, including Lipschitz-type bounds and temporal stability results. We further propose ERI-T, a dedicated measure of temporal reliability for sequential models, and introduce ERI-Bench, a benchmark designed to systematically stress-test explanation reliability across synthetic and real-world datasets. Experimental results reveal widespread reliability failures in popular explanation methods, showing that explanations can be unstable under realistic deployment conditions. By exposing and quantifying these instabilities, ERI enables principled assessment of explanation reliability and supports more trustworthy explainable AI (XAI) systems.",

      "abstract": "Neural networks achieve strong empirical performance, but robustness concerns still hinder deployment in safety-critical applications. Formal verification provides robustness guarantees, but current methods face a scalability-completeness trade-off. We propose a hybrid verifier in a branch-and-bound (BaB) framework that efficiently tightens both upper and lower bounds until an $ε-$global optimum is reached or early stop is triggered. The key is an exact nonlinear program with complementarity constraints (NLP-CC) for upper bounding that preserves the ReLU input-output graph, so any feasible solution yields a valid counterexample and enables rapid pruning of unsafe subproblems. We further accelerate verification with (i) warm-started NLP solves requiring minimal constraint-matrix updates and (ii) pattern-aligned strong branching that prioritizes splits most effective at tightening relaxations. We also provide conditions under which NLP-CC upper bounds are tight. Experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 show markedly tighter upper bounds than PGD across perturbation radii spanning up to three orders of magnitude, fast per-node solves in practice, and substantial end-to-end speedups over MIP-based verification, amplified by warm-starting, GPU batching, and pattern-aligned branching.",

      "abstract": "A large body of theory and empirical work hypothesizes a connection between the flatness of a neural network's loss landscape during training and its performance. However, there have been conceptually opposite pieces of evidence regarding when SGD prefers flatter or sharper solutions during training. In this work, we partially but causally clarify the flatness-seeking behavior of SGD by identifying and exactly solving an analytically solvable model that exhibits both flattening and sharpening behavior during training. In this model, the SGD training has no \\textit{a priori} preference for flatness, but only a preference for minimal gradient fluctuations. This leads to the insight that, at least within this model, it is data distribution that uniquely determines the sharpness at convergence, and that a flat minimum is preferred if and only if the noise in the labels is isotropic across all output dimensions. When the noise in the labels is anisotropic, the model instead prefers sharpness and can converge to an arbitrarily sharp solution, depending on the imbalance in the noise in the labels spectrum. We reproduce this key insight in controlled settings with different model architectures such as MLP, RNN, and transformers.",

      "abstract": "Large Language Models are increasingly used by students to explore advanced material in computer science, including graph theory. As these tools become integrated into undergraduate and graduate coursework, it is important to understand how reliably they support mathematically rigorous thinking. This study examines the performance of a LLM on two related graph theoretic problems: a solved problem concerning the gracefulness of line graphs and an open problem for which no solution is currently known. We use an eight stage evaluation protocol that reflects authentic mathematical inquiry, including interpretation, exploration, strategy formation, and proof construction.   The model performed strongly on the solved problem, producing correct definitions, identifying relevant structures, recalling appropriate results without hallucination, and constructing a valid proof confirmed by a graph theory expert. For the open problem, the model generated coherent interpretations and plausible exploratory strategies but did not advance toward a solution. It did not fabricate results and instead acknowledged uncertainty, which is consistent with the explicit prompting instructions that directed the model to avoid inventing theorems or unsupported claims.   These findings indicate that LLMs can support exploration of established material but remain limited in tasks requiring novel mathematical insight or critical structural reasoning. For computing education, this distinction highlights the importance of guiding students to use LLMs for conceptual exploration while relying on independent verification and rigorous argumentation for formal problem solving.",

Although transformer-based detectors achieve strong predictive performance, their explanations are often opaque to non-experts or misaligned with model decisions. We propose VEXA, an evidence-grounded and persona-adaptive framework for generating learner-facing scam explanations by integrating GradientSHAP-based attribution with theory-informed vulnerability personas. Evaluation across multi-channel datasets shows that grounding explanations in detector-derived evidence improves semantic reliability without increasing linguistic complexity, while persona conditioning introduces interpretable stylistic variation without disrupting evidential alignment. These results reveal a key design insight: evidential grounding governs semantic correctness, whereas persona-based adaptation operates at the level of presentation under constraints of faithfulness. Together, VEXA demonstrates the feasibility of persona-adaptive, evidence-grounded explanations and provides design guidance for trustworthy, learner-facing security explanations in non-formal contexts.",

Graph self-supervised learning (SSL) offers a growing toolbox of pretext objectives: mutual information, reconstruction, contrastive learning; yet combining them reliably remains a challenge due to objective interference and training instability. Most multi-pretext pipelines use per-update mixing, forcing every parameter update to be a compromise, leading to three failure modes: Disagreement (conflict-induced negative transfer), Drift (nonstationary objective utility), and Drought (hidden starvation of underserved objectives). We argue that coordination is fundamentally a temporal allocation problem: deciding when each objective receives optimization budget, not merely how to weigh them. We introduce ControlG, a control-theoretic framework that recasts multi-objective graph SSL as feedback-controlled temporal allocation by estimating per-objective difficulty and pairwise antagonism, planning target budgets via a Pareto-aware log-hypervolume planner, and scheduling with a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller. Across 9 datasets, ControlG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, while producing an auditable schedule that reveals which objectives drove learning.",

We quantify this ``multilingual penalty'' for lexical disambiguation--a task requiring precise semantic representations and contextualization mechanisms--using controlled datasets of human relatedness judgments for ambiguous words in both English and Spanish. Comparing monolingual and multilingual LMs from the same families, we find consistently reduced performance in multilingual LMs. We then explore three potential capacity constraints: representational (reduced embedding isotropy), attentional (reduced attention to disambiguating cues), and vocabulary-related (increased multi-token segmentation). Multilingual LMs show some evidence of all three limitations; moreover, these factors statistically account for the variance formerly attributed to a model's multilingual status. These findings suggest both that multilingual LMs do suffer from multiple capacity constraints, and that these constraints correlate with reduced disambiguation performance.",

      "abstract": "With the rapid progress of tool-using and agentic large language models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is evolving from one-shot, passive retrieval into multi-turn, decision-driven evidence acquisition. Despite strong results in open-domain settings, existing agentic search frameworks commonly treat long documents as flat collections of chunks, underutilizing document-native priors such as hierarchical organization and sequential discourse structure. We introduce DeepRead, a structure-aware, multi-turn document reasoning agent that explicitly operationalizes these priors for long-document question answering. DeepRead leverages LLM-based OCR model to convert PDFs into structured Markdown that preserves headings and paragraph boundaries. It then indexes documents at the paragraph level and assigns each paragraph a coordinate-style metadata key encoding its section identity and in-section order. Building on this representation, DeepRead equips the LLM with two complementary tools: a Retrieve tool that localizes relevant paragraphs while exposing their structural coordinates (with lightweight scanning context), and a ReadSection tool that enables contiguous, order-preserving reading within a specified section and paragraph range. Our experiments demonstrate that DeepRead achieves significant improvements over Search-o1-style agentic search in document question answering. The synergistic effect between retrieval and reading tools is also validated. Our fine-grained behavioral analysis reveals a reading and reasoning paradigm resembling human-like ``locate then read'' behavior.",

However, truly personalized support requires access to meaningful Learning Context (LC) regarding who the learner is, what they are trying to understand, and how they are engaging with the material. In this paper, we present a framework for measuring and diagnosing how the LC influences instructional strategy selection in LLM-based tutoring systems. Using psychometrically grounded synthetic learning contexts and a pedagogically grounded decision space, we compare LLM instructional decisions in context-blind and context-aware conditions and quantify their alignment with the pedagogical judgments of subject matter experts. Our results show that, while providing the LC induces systematic, measurable changes in instructional decisions that move LLM policies closer to the subject matter expert policy, substantial misalignment remains. To diagnose this misalignment, we introduce a relevance-impact analysis that reveals which learner characteristics are attended to, ignored, or spuriously influential in LLM instructional decision-making. This analysis, conducted in collaboration with subject matter experts, demonstrates that LC materially shapes LLM instructional planning but does not reliably induce pedagogically appropriate personalization. Our results enable principled evaluation of context-aware LLM systems and provide a foundation for improving personalization through learner characteristic prioritization, pedagogical model tuning, and LC engineering.",

To address this problem, we propose Mask-LLaVA, a framework that leverages different levels of visual features to create a compact yet information-rich visual representation for autoregressive VLMs. Namely, we combine mask-based object representations together with global tokens and local patch tokens. While all tokens are used during training, it shows that the resulting model can flexibly drop especially the number of mask-based object-tokens at test time, allowing to adapt the number of tokens during inference without the need to retrain the model and without a significant drop in performance. We evaluate the proposed approach on a suite of standard benchmarks showing results competitive to current token efficient methods and comparable to the original LLaVA baseline using only a fraction of visual tokens. Our analysis demonstrates that combining multi-level features enables efficient learning with fewer tokens while allowing dynamic token selection at test time for good performance.",

      "abstract": "Linear attention offers a computationally efficient yet expressive alternative to softmax attention. However, recent empirical results indicate that the state of trained linear attention models often exhibits a low-rank structure, suggesting that these models underexploit their capacity in practice. To illuminate this phenomenon, we provide a theoretical analysis of the role of rank in linear attention, revealing that low effective rank can affect retrieval error by amplifying query noise. In addition to these theoretical insights, we conjecture that the low-rank states can be substantially reduced post-training with only minimal performance degradation, yielding faster and more memory-efficient models. To this end, we propose a novel hardware-aware approach that structurally prunes key and query matrices, reducing the state size while retaining compatibility with existing CUDA kernels. We adapt several existing pruning strategies to fit our framework and, building on our theoretical analysis, propose a novel structured pruning method based on a rank-revealing QR decomposition. Our empirical results, evaluated across models of varying sizes and on various downstream tasks, demonstrate the effectiveness of our state reduction framework. We highlight that our framework enables the removal of 50% of the query and key channels at only a marginal increase in perplexity.

However, LIME's analysis is constrained to a single image at a time. Besides, it lacks interaction mechanisms for observing the LIME's results and direct manipulations of factors affecting the results. To address these issues, we introduce an interactive visualization tool, LIMEVis, which improves the analysis workflow of LIME by enabling users to explore multiple LIME results simultaneously and modify them directly. With LIMEVis, we could conveniently identify common features in images that a model seems to mainly consider for category classification. Additionally, by interactively modifying the LIME results, we could determine which segments in an image influence the model's classification.",

Our approach relies on spherical needlet frames, which yield a localized multiscale decomposition while preserving tight frame properties in the natural square-integrable function space on the sphere.   We construct unbiased estimators of suitably truncated versions of the functional and derive sharp oracle risk bounds through an explicit bias--variance analysis.

      "abstract": "The rapid growth of large language models (LLMs) has outpaced the evolution of single-GPU hardware, making model scale increasingly constrained by memory capacity rather than computation. While modern training systems extend GPU memory through distributed parallelism and offloading across CPU and storage tiers, they fundamentally retain a GPU-centric execution paradigm in which GPUs host persistent model replicas and full autograd graphs. As a result, scaling large models remains tightly coupled to multi-GPU clusters, complex distributed runtimes, and unpredictable host memory consumption, creating substantial barriers for node-scale post-training workloads such as instruction tuning, alignment, and domain adaptation. We present Horizon-LM, a memory-centric training system that redefines the roles of CPU and GPU for large-model optimization. Horizon-LM treats host memory as the authoritative parameter store and uses GPUs solely as transient compute engines through a CPU-master, GPU-template execution model. By eliminating persistent GPU-resident modules and autograd graphs, employing explicit recomputation with manual gradient propagation, and introducing a pipelined double-buffered execution engine, Horizon-LM decouples model scale from GPU count and bounds memory usage to the theoretical parameter footprint. On a single H200 GPU with 1.5\\,TB host RAM, Horizon-LM reliably trains models up to 120B parameters. On a standard single A100 machine, Horizon-LM achieves up to 12.2$\\times$ higher training throughput than DeepSpeed ZeRO-3 with CPU offloading while preserving numerical correctness. Across platforms and scales, Horizon-LM sustains high device utilization and predictable memory growth, demonstrating that host memory, not GPU memory, defines the true feasibility boundary for node-scale large-model training.",

However, rigorously measuring this foundational capability is hindered by two obstacles: the entanglement of prior knowledge, where ``new'' knowledge may appear in pre-training data, and the entanglement of reasoning complexity, where failures may stem from problem difficulty rather than an inability to recall learned knowledge. We introduce SE-Bench, a diagnostic environment that obfuscates the NumPy library and its API doc into a pseudo-novel package with randomized identifiers. Agents are trained to internalize this package and evaluated on simple coding tasks without access to documentation, yielding a clean setting where tasks are trivial with the new API doc but impossible for base models without it. Our investigation reveals three insights: (1) the Open-Book Paradox, where training with reference documentation inhibits retention, requiring \"Closed-Book Training\" to force knowledge compression into weights; (2) the RL Gap, where standard RL fails to internalize new knowledge completely due to PPO clipping and negative gradients; and (3) the viability of Self-Play for internalization, proving models can learn from self-generated, noisy tasks when coupled with SFT, but not RL. Overall, SE-Bench establishes a rigorous diagnostic platform for self-evolution with knowledge internalization. Our code and dataset can be found at https://github.com/thunlp/SE-Bench.",

While traditional coding theoretic schemes rely on a strict trust assumption, that honest nodes must outnumber adversarial ones to guarantee valid decoding, the game of coding leverages the economic rationality of actors to guarantee correctness and reliable decodability, even in the presence of an adversarial majority. This capability is paramount for emerging permissionless applications, particularly decentralized machine learning (DeML). However, prior investigations into the game of coding have been strictly confined to scalar computations, limiting their applicability to real world tasks where high dimensional data is the norm. In this paper, we bridge this gap by extending the framework to the general $N$-dimensional Euclidean space. We provide a rigorous problem formulation for vector valued computations and fully characterize the equilibrium strategies of the resulting high dimensional game. Our analysis demonstrates that the resilience properties established in the scalar setting are preserved in the vector regime, establishing a theoretical foundation for secure, large scale decentralized computing without honest majority assumptions.",

      "abstract": "Low Earth Orbit (LEO) constellations are revolutionizing the space sector, with on-board Artificial Intelligence (AI) becoming pivotal for next-generation satellites. AI acceleration is essential for safety-critical functions such as autonomous Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC), where errors cannot be tolerated, and performance-critical processing of high-bandwidth sensor data, where occasional errors are tolerable. Consequently, AI accelerators for satellites must combine robust protection against radiation-induced faults with high throughput. This paper presents Safe-NEureka, a Hybrid Modular Redundant Deep Neural Network (DNN) accelerator for heterogeneous RISC-V systems. It operates in two modes: a redundancy mode utilizing Dual Modular Redundancy (DMR) with hardware-based recovery, and a performance mode repurposing redundant datapaths to maximize parallel throughput. Furthermore, its memory interface is protected by Error Correction Codes (ECCs), and the controller by Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR). Implementation in GlobalFoundries 12nm technology shows a 96 reduction in faulty executions in redundancy mode, with a manageable 15 area overhead. In performance mode, the architecture achieves near-baseline speeds on 3x3 dense convolutions with a 5 throughput and 11 efficiency reduction, compared to 48 and 53 in redundancy mode. This flexibility ensures high overheads are limited to critical tasks, establishing Safe-NEureka as a versatile solution for space applications.",

We introduce VISTA-Bench, a systematic benchmark from multimodal perception, reasoning, to unimodal understanding domains. It evaluates visualized text understanding by contrasting pure-text and visualized-text questions under controlled rendering conditions. Extensive evaluation of over 20 representative VLMs reveals a pronounced modality gap: models that perform well on pure-text queries often degrade substantially when equivalent semantic content is presented as visualized text. This gap is further amplified by increased perceptual difficulty, highlighting sensitivity to rendering variations despite unchanged semantics. Overall, VISTA-Bench provides a principled evaluation framework to diagnose this limitation and to guide progress toward more unified language representations across tokenized text and pixels.

While classical quickest change detection methods provide strong guarantees on detection delay and false-alarm rates, existing approaches for point-process data predominantly focus on temporal changes and do not explicitly infer affected spatial regions. We propose a likelihood-free, score-based detection framework that jointly estimates the change time and the change region in continuous space-time without assuming parametric knowledge of the pre- or post-change dynamics. The method leverages a localized and conditionally weighted Hyvärinen score to quantify event-level deviations from nominal behavior and aggregates these scores using a spatio-temporal CUSUM-type statistic over a prescribed class of spatial regions. Operating sequentially, the procedure outputs both a stopping time and an estimated change region, enabling real-time detection with spatial interpretability. We establish theoretical guarantees on false-alarm control, detection delay, and spatial localization accuracy, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach through simulations and real-world spatio-temporal event data.",

      "abstract": "Automatic speech recognition (ASR) for conversational speech remains challenging due to the limited availability of large-scale, well-annotated multi-speaker dialogue data and the complex temporal dynamics of natural interactions. Speaker-aware simulated conversations (SASC) offer an effective data augmentation strategy by transforming single-speaker recordings into realistic multi-speaker dialogues. However, prior work has primarily focused on English data, leaving questions about the applicability to lower-resource languages. In this paper, we adapt and implement the SASC framework for Hungarian conversational ASR. We further propose C-SASC, an extended variant that incorporates pause modeling conditioned on utterance duration, enabling a more faithful representation of local temporal dependencies observed in human conversation while retaining the simplicity and efficiency of the original approach. We generate synthetic Hungarian dialogues from the BEA-Large corpus and combine them with real conversational data for ASR training. Both SASC and C-SASC are evaluated extensively under a wide range of simulation configurations, using conversational statistics derived from CallHome, BEA-Dialogue, and GRASS corpora. Experimental results show that speaker-aware conversational simulation consistently improves recognition performance over naive concatenation-based augmentation. While the additional duration conditioning in C-SASC yields modest but systematic gains--most notably in character-level error rates--its effectiveness depends on the match between source conversational statistics and the target domain. Overall, our findings confirm the robustness of speaker-aware conversational simulation for Hungarian ASR and highlight the benefits and limitations of increasingly detailed temporal modeling in synthetic dialogue generation.",

However, standard evaluation tools like the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under the curve (AUC) are designed for point scores and fail to capture the impact of predictive uncertainty on ranking performance. We propose an uncertainty-aware ROC framework specifically for interval-valued predictions, introducing two new measures: $AUC_L$ and $AUC_U$. This framework enables an informative three-region decomposition of the ROC plane, partitioning pairwise rankings into correct, incorrect, and uncertain orderings. This approach naturally supports selective prediction by allowing models to abstain from ranking cases with overlapping intervals, thereby optimizing the trade-off between abstention rate and discriminative reliability. We prove that under valid class-conditional coverage, $AUC_L$ and $AUC_U$ provide formal lower and upper bounds on the theoretical optimal AUC ($AUC^*$), characterizing the physical limit of achievable discrimination. The proposed framework applies broadly to interval-valued prediction models, regardless of the interval construction method. Experiments on real-world benchmark datasets, using bootstrap-based intervals as one instantiation, validate the framework's correctness and demonstrate its practical utility for uncertainty-aware evaluation and decision-making.",

We compare this method with tensorial (dipole) kernel models, as established in our previous work, in which the tensorial structure of the Born effective charge is encoded directly in the kernel and obtained via its derivative. Both approaches are then used for charge partitioning, enabling the separation of monopole and dipole contributions.

Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have improved MT system performance, adapting them to lesser-represented languages remains challenging. In-context learning (ICL) may offer novel ways to adapt LLMs for low-resource MT by conditioning models on demonstration at inference time. In this study, we explore scaling low-resource machine translation ICL beyond the few-shot setting to thousands of examples with long-context models. We scale in-context token budget to 1M tokens and compare three types of training corpora used as in-context supervision: monolingual unsupervised data, instruction-style data, and parallel data (English--target and Indonesian--target). Our experiments on Javanese and Sundanese show that gains from additional context saturate quickly and can degrade near the maximum context window, with scaling behavior strongly dependent on corpus type. Notably, some forms of monolingual supervision can be competitive with parallel data, despite the latter offering additional supervision. Overall, our results characterize the effective limits and corpus-type sensitivity of long-context ICL for low-resource MT, highlighting that larger context windows do not necessarily yield proportional quality gains.",

By proposing a refined analysis on the non-consecutive gradient variation, a fundamental quantity in gradient variation with bandits, we improve the dimension dependence for both convex and strongly convex functions compared with the best known results (Chiang et al., 2013). Our improved analysis for the non-consecutive gradient variation also implies other favorable problem-dependent guarantees, such as gradient-variance and small-loss regrets. Beyond the two-point setup, we demonstrate the versatility of our technique by achieving the first gradient-variation bound for one-point bandit linear optimization over hyper-rectangular domains.

      "title": "When Silence Is Golden: Can LLMs Learn to Abstain in Temporal QA and Beyond?",
      "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) rarely admit uncertainty, often producing fluent but misleading answers, rather than abstaining (i.e., refusing to answer). This weakness is even evident in temporal question answering, where models frequently ignore time-sensitive evidence and conflate facts across different time-periods. In this paper, we present the first empirical study of training LLMs with an abstention ability while reasoning about temporal QA. Existing approaches such as calibration might be unreliable in capturing uncertainty in complex reasoning. We instead frame abstention as a teachable skill and introduce a pipeline that couples Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision with Reinforcement Learning (RL) guided by abstention-aware rewards. Our goal is to systematically analyze how different information types and training techniques affect temporal reasoning with abstention behavior in LLMs. Through extensive experiments studying various methods, we find that RL yields strong empirical gains on reasoning: a model initialized by Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct surpasses GPT-4o by $3.46\\%$ and $5.80\\%$ in Exact Match on TimeQA-Easy and Hard, respectively. Moreover, it improves the True Positive rate on unanswerable questions by $20\\%$ over a pure supervised fine-tuned (SFT) variant. Beyond performance, our analysis shows that SFT induces overconfidence and harms reliability, while RL improves prediction accuracy but exhibits similar risks. Finally, by comparing implicit reasoning cues (e.g., original context, temporal sub-context, knowledge graphs) with explicit CoT supervision, we find that implicit information provides limited benefit for reasoning with abstention. Our study provides new insights into how abstention and reasoning can be jointly optimized, providing a foundation for building more reliable LLMs.",

To address this, we study the query-key (QK) space -- the bilinear joint embedding space between queries and keys. We present a contrastive covariance method to decompose the QK space into low-rank, human-interpretable components. It is when features in keys and queries align in these low-rank subspaces that high attention scores are produced. We first study our method both analytically and empirically in a simplified setting. We then apply our method to large language models to identify human-interpretable QK subspaces for categorical semantic features and binding features.

We explore whether providing contextual information, specifically user profile summaries derived from historical posts, can improve classification accuracy. Using a real-world political forum dataset, we generate structured profiles that summarize users' ideological leaning, recurring topics, and linguistic patterns. We evaluate seven state-of-the-art LLMs across baseline and context-enriched setups through a comprehensive cross-model evaluation. Our findings show that contextual prompts significantly boost accuracy, with improvements ranging from +17.5\\% to +38.5\\%, achieving up to 74\\% accuracy that surpasses previous approaches. We also analyze how profile size and post selection strategies affect performance, showing that strategically chosen political content yields better results than larger, randomly selected contexts. These findings underscore the value of incorporating user-level context to enhance LLM performance in nuanced political classification tasks.",

Existing methods struggle to detect such risks before fine-tuning, making post hoc evaluation costly and inefficient. To address this challenge, we introduce Data2Behavior, a new task for predicting unintended model behaviors prior to training. We also propose Manipulating Data Features (MDF), a lightweight approach that summarizes candidate data through their mean representations and injects them into the forward pass of a base model, allowing latent statistical signals in the data to shape model activations and reveal potential biases and safety risks without updating any parameters. MDF achieves reliable prediction while consuming only about 20% of the GPU resources required for fine-tuning. Experiments on Qwen3-14B, Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, and Gemma-3-12b-it confirm that MDF can anticipate unintended behaviors and provide insight into pre-training vulnerabilities.",

Recently, LLM-based retriever models have shown state-of-the-art performance for RAG applications. However, several technical aspects remain underexplored on how to adapt general-purpose LLMs into effective domain-specific retrievers, especially in specialized domains such as biomedicine. We present Synthesize-Train-Merge (STM), a modular framework that enhances decoder-only LLMs with synthetic hard negatives, retrieval prompt optimization, and model merging. Experiments on a subset of 12 medical and general tasks from the MTEB benchmark show STM boosts task-specific experts by up to 23.5\\% (average 7.5\\%) and produces merged models that outperform both single experts and strong baselines without extensive pretraining. Our results demonstrate a scalable, efficient path for turning general LLMs into high-performing, domain-specialized retrievers, preserving general-domain capabilities while excelling on specialized tasks.",

Existing MT benchmarks emphasise token-level and grammatical accuracy, but of ten overlook pragmatic and culturally grounded competencies required for real-world localisation. Building on a pilot study of 87 translations across 20 languages, we evaluate 7 multilingual LLMs across 15 target languages with 5 native-speaker raters per language. Raters scored both full-text translations and segment-level instances of culturally nuanced language (idioms, puns, holidays, and culturally embedded concepts) on an ordinal 0-3 quality scale; segment ratings additionally included an NA option for untranslated segments.   Across full-text evaluations, mean overall quality is modest (1.68/3): GPT-5 (2.10/3), Claude Sonnet 3.7 (1.97/3), and Mistral Medium 3.1 (1.84/3) form the strongest tier with fewer catastrophic failures. Segment-level results show sharp category effects: holidays (2.20/3) and cultural concepts (2.19/3) translate substantially better than idioms (1.65/3) and puns (1.45/3), and idioms are most likely to be left untranslated. These findings demonstrate a persistent gap between grammatical adequacy and cultural resonance. To our knowledge, this is the first multilingual, human-annotated benchmark focused explicitly on cultural nuance in translation and localisation, highlighting the need for culturally informed training data, improved cross-lingual pragmatics, and evaluation paradigms that better reflect real-world communicative competence.",

However, when the true Koopman eigenfunctions cannot be identified from finite data, multi-step predictions may suffer from structural inaccuracies and systematic bias. To address this issue, we analyse the first and second moments of the multi-step prediction residual. By decomposing the residual into contributions from the one-step approximation error and the propagation of accumulated inaccuracies, we derive a closed-form expression characterising these effects. This analysis enables the development of a novel and computationally efficient algorithm that enforces unbiasedness and reduces variance in the resulting predictor. The proposed method is validated in numerical simulations, showing improved uncertainty properties compared to standard EDMD. These results lay the foundation for uncertainty-aware and unbiased Koopman-based prediction frameworks that can be extended to controlled and stochastic systems.",

This reduces interference and superposition between the features, while keeping performance on the target dataset essentially unchanged. Our orthogonality penalty leads to identifiable features, ensuring the uniqueness of the decomposition. Further, we find that the distance between embedded feature explanations increases with stricter orthogonality penalty, a desirable property for interpretability. Invoking the $\\textit{Independent Causal Mechanisms}$ principle, we argue that orthogonality promotes modular representations amenable to causal intervention. We empirically show that these increasingly orthogonalized features allow for isolated interventions. Our code is available under $\\texttt{https://github.com/mrtzmllr/sae-icm}$.",

We introduce the first evolutionary, hardware-in-the-loop mapping framework for neuromorphic accelerators, enabling users without deep hardware knowledge to deploy workloads more efficiently. We evaluate our approach on Intel Loihi 2, a representative spatial accelerator featuring 152 cores per chip in a 2D mesh. Our method achieves up to 35% reduction in total latency compared to default heuristics on two sparse multi-layer perceptron networks. Furthermore, we demonstrate the scalability of our approach to multi-chip systems and observe an up to 40% improvement in energy efficiency, without explicitly optimizing for it.",

      "abstract": "While message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) have shown promising results, their real-world impact remains limited. Although various limitations have been identified, their theoretical foundations remain poorly understood, leading to fragmented research efforts. In this thesis, we provide an in-depth theoretical analysis and identify several key properties limiting the performance of MPNNs. Building on these findings, we propose several frameworks that address these shortcomings. We identify two properties exhibited by many MPNNs: shared component amplification (SCA), where each message-passing iteration amplifies the same components across all feature channels, and component dominance (CD), where a single component gets increasingly amplified as more message-passing steps are applied. These properties lead to the observable phenomenon of rank collapse of node representations, which generalizes the established over-smoothing phenomenon. By generalizing and decomposing over-smoothing, we enable a deeper understanding of MPNNs, more targeted solutions, and more precise communication within the field. To avoid SCA, we show that utilizing multiple computational graphs or edge relations is necessary. Our multi-relational split (MRS) framework transforms any existing MPNN into one that leverages multiple edge relations. Additionally, we introduce the spectral graph convolution for multiple feature channels (MIMO-GC), which naturally uses multiple computational graphs. A localized variant, LMGC, approximates the MIMO-GC while inheriting its beneficial properties. To address CD, we demonstrate a close connection between MPNNs and the PageRank algorithm. Based on personalized PageRank, we propose a variant of MPNNs that allows for infinitely many message-passing iterations, while preserving initial node features. Collectively, these results deepen the theoretical understanding of MPNNs.",

In this paper, we investigate intermediate merge residues in BPE vocabularies: tokens that are frequent during merge learning so that retained in the final vocabulary, but are mostly further merged and rarely emitted when tokenizing the corpus during tokenizer usage. Such low-frequency tokens not only waste vocabulary capacity but also increase vulnerability to adversarial or atypical inputs. We present a systematic empirical characterization of this phenomenon across commonly used tokenizers and introduce LiteToken, a simple method for removing residue tokens. Because the affected tokens are rarely used, pretrained models can often accommodate the modified tokenizer without additional fine-tuning. Experiments show that LiteToken reduces token fragmentation, reduces parameters, and improves robustness to noisy or misspelled inputs, while preserving overall performance.",

All modalities are trained from scratch under a unified next-group-of-tokens prediction objective, based on an ultra-sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture with modality-agnostic expert routing. To address practical challenges in large-scale deployment under diverse resource constraints, ERNIE 5.0 adopts a novel elastic training paradigm. Within a single pre-training run, the model learns a family of sub-models with varying depths, expert capacities, and routing sparsity, enabling flexible trade-offs among performance, model size, and inference latency in memory- or time-constrained scenarios. Moreover, we systematically address the challenges of scaling reinforcement learning to unified foundation models, thereby guaranteeing efficient and stable post-training under ultra-sparse MoE architectures and diverse multimodal settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ERNIE 5.0 achieves strong and balanced performance across multiple modalities. To the best of our knowledge, among publicly disclosed models, ERNIE 5.0 represents the first production-scale realization of a trillion-parameter unified autoregressive model that supports both multimodal understanding and generation. To facilitate further research, we present detailed visualizations of modality-agnostic expert routing in the unified model, alongside comprehensive empirical analysis of elastic training, aiming to offer profound insights to the community.",

      "abstract": "Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in open-world zero-shot visual recognition. However, their potential in space-related applications remains largely unexplored. In the space domain, accurate manual annotation is particularly challenging due to factors such as low visibility, illumination variations, and object blending with planetary backgrounds. Developing methods that can detect and segment spacecraft and orbital targets without requiring extensive manual labeling is therefore of critical importance. In this work, we propose an annotation-free detection and segmentation pipeline for space targets using VLMs. Our approach begins by automatically generating pseudo-labels for a small subset of unlabeled real data with a pre-trained VLM. These pseudo-labels are then leveraged in a teacher-student label distillation framework to train lightweight models. Despite the inherent noise in the pseudo-labels, the distillation process leads to substantial performance gains over direct zero-shot VLM inference. Experimental evaluations on the SPARK-2024, SPEED+, and TANGO datasets on segmentation tasks demonstrate consistent improvements in average precision (AP) by up to 10 points. Code and models are available at https://github.com/giddyyupp/annotation-free-spacecraft-segmentation.",

      "abstract": "Molecular representations are inherently task-dependent, yet most pre-trained molecular encoders are not. Task conditioning promises representations that reorganize based on task descriptions, but existing approaches rely on expensive labeled data. We show that weak supervision on programmatically derived molecular motifs is sufficient. Our Adaptive Chemical Embedding Model (ACE-Mol) learns from hundreds of motifs paired with natural language descriptors that are cheap to compute, trivial to scale. Conventional encoders slowly search the embedding space for task-relevant structure, whereas ACE-Mol immediately aligns its representations with the task. ACE-Mol achieves state-of-the-art performance across molecular property prediction benchmarks with interpretable, chemically meaningful representations.",

      "title": "Turbulence teaches equivariance to neural networks",
      "abstract": "We investigate how the rotational nature of turbulence affects learned mappings between quantities governed by the Navier-Stokes equations. By varying the degree of anisotropy in a turbulence dataset, we explore how statistical symmetry affects these mappings. To do this, we train super-resolution models at different wall-normal locations in a channel flow, where anisotropy varies naturally, and test their generalization. By evaluating the learned mappings on new coordinate frames and new flow conditions, we find that coordinate-frame generalization is a key part of the generalization problem. Turbulent flows naturally present a wide range of local orientations, so respecting the symmetries of the Navier-Stokes equations improves generalization to new flows. Importantly, turbulence's rotational structure can embed these symmetries into learned mappings -- an effect that strengthens with isotropy and dataset size. This is because a more isotropic dataset samples a wider range of orientations, more fully covering the rotational symmetries of the Navier-Stokes equations. The dependence on isotropy means equivariance error is also scale-dependent, consistent with Kolmogorov's hypothesis. Therefore, turbulence provides its own data augmentation (we term this implicit data augmentation). We expect this effect to apply broadly to learned mappings between tensorial flow quantities, making it relevant to most machine learning applications in turbulence.",

      "title": "LinGO: A Linguistic Graph Optimization Framework with LLMs for Interpreting Intents of Online Uncivil Discourse",
      "abstract": "Detecting uncivil language is crucial for maintaining safe, inclusive, and democratic online spaces. Yet existing classifiers often misinterpret posts containing uncivil cues but expressing civil intents, leading to inflated estimates of harmful incivility online. We introduce LinGO, a linguistic graph optimization framework for large language models (LLMs) that leverages linguistic structures and optimization techniques to classify multi-class intents of incivility that use various direct and indirect expressions. LinGO decomposes language into multi-step linguistic components, identifies targeted steps that cause the most errors, and iteratively optimizes prompt and/or example components for targeted steps. We evaluate it using a dataset collected during the 2022 Brazilian presidential election, encompassing four forms of political incivility: Impoliteness (IMP), Hate Speech and Stereotyping (HSST), Physical Harm and Violent Political Rhetoric (PHAVPR), and Threats to Democratic Institutions and Values (THREAT). Each instance is annotated with six types of civil/uncivil intent. We benchmark LinGO using three cost-efficient LLMs: GPT-5-mini, Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite, and Claude 3 Haiku, and four optimization techniques: TextGrad, AdalFlow, DSPy, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The results show that, across all models, LinGO consistently improves accuracy and weighted F1 compared with zero-shot, chain-of-thought, direct optimization, and fine-tuning baselines. RAG is the strongest optimization technique and, when paired with Gemini model, achieves the best overall performance. These findings demonstrate that incorporating multi-step linguistic components into LLM instructions and optimize targeted components can help the models explain complex semantic meanings, which can be extended to other complex semantic explanation tasks in the future.",

Analyses often link network structure to node-level covariates, but existing methods falter with sparse networks and high-dimensional node features. We propose a joint latent space modeling framework for sparse networks with high-dimensional binary node covariates that performs covariate selection while accounting for uncertainty in estimated latent positions. Building on joint latent space models that couple edges and node variables through shared latent positions, we introduce a group lasso screening step and incorporate a measurement-error-aware stabilization term to mitigate bias from using estimated latent positions as predictors. We establish prediction error rates for the covariate component both when latent positions are treated as observed and when they are estimated with bounded error; under uniform control across $q$ covariates and $n$ nodes, the rate is of order $O(\\log q / n)$ up to an additional term due to latent position estimation error. Our method addresses three challenges: (1) incorporating information from isolated nodes, which are common in sparse networks but often ignored; (2) selecting relevant covariates from high-dimensional spaces; and (3) accounting for uncertainty in estimated latent positions. Simulations show predictive performance remains stable as covariate sparsity grows, while naive approaches degrade. We illustrate how the method can support efficient study design using household social networks from 75 Indian villages, where an emulated pilot study screens a large covariate battery and substantially reduces required subsequent data collection without sacrificing network predictive accuracy.",

      "abstract": "Electroencephalography (EEG) analysis is critical for brain-computer interfaces and neuroscience, but the intrinsic noise and high dimensionality of EEG signals hinder effective feature learning. We propose a self-supervised framework based on the Hierarchical Functional Maximal Correlation Algorithm (HFMCA), which learns orthonormal EEG representations by enforcing feature decorrelation and reducing redundancy. This design enables robust capture of essential brain dynamics for various EEG recognition tasks. We validate HFMCA on two benchmark datasets, SEED and BCIC-2A, where pretraining with HFMCA consistently outperforms competitive self-supervised baselines, achieving notable gains in classification accuracy. Across diverse EEG tasks, our method demonstrates superior cross-subject generalization under leave-one-subject-out validation, advancing state-of-the-art by 2.71\\% on SEED emotion recognition and 2.57\\% on BCIC-2A motor imagery classification.",

      "abstract": "Knowledge Distillation (KD) transfers knowledge from a large teacher model to a smaller student by aligning their predictive distributions. However, conventional KD formulations - typically based on Kullback-Leibler divergence - assume that the teacher provides reliable soft targets. In practice, teacher predictions are often noisy or overconfident, and existing correction-based approaches rely on ad-hoc heuristics and extensive hyper-parameter tuning, which hinders generalization. We introduce REDistill (Robust Estimator Distillation), a simple yet principled framework grounded in robust statistics. REDistill replaces the standard KD objective with a power divergence loss, a generalization of KL divergence that adaptively downweights unreliable teacher output while preserving informative logit relationships. This formulation provides a unified and interpretable treatment of teacher noise, requires only logits, integrates seamlessly into existing KD pipelines, and incurs negligible computational overhead. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k demonstrate that REDistill consistently improves student accuracy in diverse teacher-student architectures. Remarkably, it achieves these gains without model-specific hyper-parameter tuning, underscoring its robustness and strong generalization to unseen teacher-student pairs.",

      "abstract": "Transportation on graphs is a fundamental challenge across many domains, where decisions must respect topological and operational constraints. Despite the need for actionable policies, existing graph-transport methods lack this expressivity. They rely on restrictive assumptions, fail to generalize across sparse topologies, and scale poorly with graph size and time horizon. To address these issues, we introduce Generalized Schrödinger Bridge on Graphs (GSBoG), a novel scalable data-driven framework for learning executable controlled continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) policies on arbitrary graphs under state cost augmented dynamics. Notably, GSBoG learns trajectory-level policies, avoiding dense global solvers and thereby enhancing scalability. This is achieved via a likelihood optimization approach, satisfying the endpoint marginals, while simultaneously optimizing intermediate behavior under state-dependent running costs. Extensive experimentation on challenging real-world graph topologies shows that GSBoG reliably learns accurate, topology-respecting policies while optimizing application-specific intermediate state costs, highlighting its broad applicability and paving new avenues for cost-aware dynamical transport on general graphs.",

      "abstract": "We study deterministic top-k retrieval under Longest Common Prefix (LCP) similarity for N sequences of length L. We prove a tight Omega(N) space lower bound (cell-probe model) and present a trie-based index using O(N*L) space with O(L+k) query time. We contrast this with pairwise materialization (Theta(N^2)), which hits a practical OOM wall at scale, while our indexed approach remains O(N) in memory. We then introduce Thermal-Aware Logic (TAL), which turns prefix structure into range-bounded scans. In hardware measurements, TAL reduces energy per query by 308x (0.0145 J vs 4.46 J) and cuts p95 latency by 329x (0.114 ms vs 37.5 ms) on a 20M-item range-scan benchmark, while sustaining near-peak utilization (~99%) under long runs. The result is a deterministic retrieval primitive with receipts in regimes where approximate methods are unacceptable.",

      "abstract": "Stochastic processes are often represented through orthonormal series expansions, a framework originating in the classical works of Loève and Karhunen and widely used for simulation and numerical approximation. While truncation error in such expansions has been extensively studied, practical models frequently involve an additional source of error arising from the approximation of coefficient functions when closed-form expressions are unavailable. The combined effect of these two errors remains insufficiently addressed in the literature. Building on the author's earlier work on reliability and accuracy estimates for $\\varphi$-sub-Gaussian processes, this paper extends the methodology to orthonormal polynomial systems that do not possess normalized generating functions in analytical form, including the Legendre, generalized Laguerre, and Gegenbauer families. New bounds are derived for models in $L_p(T)$ and $C([0,T])$ that simultaneously account for truncation and coefficient approximation. The resulting criteria provide practical guidance for selecting the number of series terms required to achieve prescribed levels of reliability and accuracy across a broader class of polynomial-based stochastic process models.",

      "title": "SAFE: Stable Alignment Finetuning with Entropy-Aware Predictive Control for RLHF",
      "abstract": "Optimization (PPO) has been positioned by recent literature as the canonical method for the RL part of RLHF. PPO performs well empirically but has a heuristic motivation and handles the KL-divergence constraint used in LM-RLHF in an ad-hoc manner and suffers form reward oscillations, entropy collapse, value function drift, and sudden policy divergence that require frequent restarts and extensive hyperparameter tuning. In this paper, we develop a new pure on policy actor-critic RL method for the LM-RLHF setting. We present SAFE (Stable Alignment Finetuning with Entropy-aware control),a novel RLHF algorithm that combines a Double Soft-Min Critic for pessimistic value estimation with a new multi-layer stabilization framework combining entropy-gated KL regulation, and PID-controlled adaptive thresholds. Unlike standard PPO's symmetric KL penalties, SAFE distinguishes high-entropy exploration from low-entropy mode collapse and adjusts penalties dynamically based on reward velocity. Experiments on a 3B parameter model show SAFE achieves +5.15\\% training-average reward than PPO (0.725 vs 0.689), negligible reward crashes, and superior KL control than ppo . Our method adds minimal computational overhead and provides an interpretable, crash-resistant RLHF framework that maintains aggressive learning speed while ensuring stable long-horizon optimization suitable for production deployment.

While Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPA) offer a promising framework for modeling the latent evolution of these systems, their application is hindered by representation collapse and an inability to capture precursor signals across varying temporal scales. To address these limitations, we propose MTS-JEPA, a specialized architecture that integrates a multi-resolution predictive objective with a soft codebook bottleneck. This design explicitly decouples transient shocks from long-term trends, and utilizes the codebook to capture discrete regime transitions. Notably, we find this constraint also acts as an intrinsic regularizer to ensure optimization stability. Empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks confirm that our approach effectively prevents degenerate solutions and achieves state-of-the-art performance under the early-warning protocol.",
