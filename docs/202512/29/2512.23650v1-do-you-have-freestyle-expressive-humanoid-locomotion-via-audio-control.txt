enabling poolicy to generate rhythm-aligned co-speech gestures and dance movements via input speech or music.
Abstract
Humans intuitively move to sound, but current humanoid
robots lack expressive improvisational capabilities, confined
to predefined motions or sparse commands. Generating mo-
tion from audio and then retargeting it to robots relies on
explicit motion reconstruction, leading to cascaded errors,
high latency, and disjointed acoustic-actuation mapping. We
propose RoboPerform, the first unified audio-to-locomotion
framework that can directly generate music-driven dance
and speech-driven co-speech gestures from audio. Guided by
the core principle of “motion = content + style”, the frame-
work treats audio as implicit style signals and eliminates
the need for explicit motion reconstruction. RoboPerform
integrates a ResMoE teacher policy for adapting to diverse
motion patterns and a diffusion-based student policy for au-
dio style injection. This retargeting-free design ensures low
latency and high fidelity. Experimental validation shows that
RoboPerform achieves promising results in physical plausi-
bility and audio alignment, successfully transforming robots
into responsive performers capable of reacting to audio.
1. Introduction
Humans move to sound. A drumbeat invites a step; a rising
melody prompts a leap; spoken emphasis naturally evokes
a gesture. These responses are not mere kinematic mimicry
but arise from an intrinsic understanding of rhythm, phrasing,
and intent, which is a process where perception precedes
imitation. In contrast, most humanoid locomotion systems
today are either constrained to mimic pre-defined motion
clips [4, 7, 8, 10, 16, 28, 43] or to follow sparse language
commands [23, 36, 45]. While effective for simple scripting,

these interfaces lack the capacity for expressive, context-
sensitive control, and they bypass a crucial question for
performative robots: Do you have freestyle?
We argue that humanoid locomotion is fundamentally a
generative problem: given a conditioning signal, synthesize
physically plausible, stylistically aligned, and semantically
grounded motion. This view invites richer modalities beyond
text and motion capture, particularly audio, which is dense in
temporal structure yet compact to transmit. Music encodes
beat, tempo, and timbre that shape movement style; speech
carries prosody, emphasis, and discourse rhythm that cue
co-speech gestures. Treating audio as a first-class control
signal transforms the robot from a replica to a performer:
from mechanically replaying dance poses to improvising
to the soundtrack; from reading a script to speaking with
embodied gestures.
However, dominant pipelines are ill-suited for audio-
conditioned control. Explicitly generating human motion
via audio-driven motion generators [2, 24, 26], followed by
retargeting and tracking to the robot via a controller, inher-
ently introduces three systemic issues: (1) cascaded error
accumulation across decoding, retargeting, and tracking,
which degrades both expressive fidelity and physical consis-
tency; (2) significant inference latency induced by sequential
multi-stage processing, which hinders practical deployment
and rapid iteration; (3) loose coupling between high-level
acoustic cues and low-level joint actuation, each module is
optimized in isolation, failing to preserve fine-grained ex-
pressions such as style, timing, and dynamics. Building on
this observation, a more direct and natural insight emerges:
bypass explicit motion reconstruction, directly encode raw
audio, and treat stylistic elements (e.g., beats, prosody, and
energy envelopes) as implicit control signals to modulate
and refine humanoid locomotion.
Our key insight is simple: motion = content + style.
Building on latent motion representations [23], we define
content as a high-level motion latent which is encoded from
a text command (e.g., “a person is dancing”) via a text-to-
motion model to specify the core task. We treat style as the
audio signal (e.g., music beats or speech prosody), which
dictates how that task is performed. We introduce RoboP-
erform, a teacher-student framework designed to realize
this decomposition. The teacher policy utilizes a ∆MoE, a
residual mixture-of-experts architecture, where its experts
specialize in diverse motion regimes and complement one
another. This knowledge is then distilled into the student
policy, a diffusion-based generator. This student policy ex-
plicitly decomposes the generation: it is conditioned on the
content latent to preserve the core task, while simultane-
ously injecting the audio-driven style latents. This design
achieves our goal, enabling the robot to perform the core
task while precisely aligning its movements with acoustic
details, such as synchronized steps to the beat and nuanced
gestures aligned with prosody.
Concretely, RoboPerform guides its diffusion policy us-
ing two distinct sets of latents: high-level content latents
that define the core task, and temporally-aligned style latents
that encode kinematic and prosodic details. These combined
latents serve as expressive anchors that guide the student
policy to denoise executable actions on the humanoid. This
retargeting-free, latent-driven design improves overall infer-
ence efficiency, enhances motion fidelity, and ensures fine-
grained temporal alignment via the motion latent space. It
scales across behaviors, from rhythm- and genre-conditioned
freestyle dance to presenter-style co-speech gestures that im-
prove clarity and engagement.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and prac-
ticality of RoboPerform across both music-to-dance and
speech-to-gesture. RoboPerform delivers temporally aligned,
physically plausible motion with smoother style control and
significantly higher inference efficiency than retargeting-
based pipelines. We further demonstrate its capabilities,
enabling humanoids to perform freestyle dance to music and
function as hosts, which are presented in Figure 1. In short,
RoboPerform reframes humanoid control around audio,
moving from motion replay to responsive performance.
Our contributions can be summarized as follows:
• To our knowledge, RoboPerform is the first framework to
utilize audio as an implicit control modality for unified
humanoid locomotion and gestural expression, bridging
what is heard with how a humanoid moves.
• We propose ∆MoE in the teacher policy specializes in
diverse motion regimes via a mixture-of-experts design,
while the student policy decomposes motion into con-
tent and style to inject audio-driven style signals into a
diffusion-based generator, preserving timing fidelity and
reducing end-to-end latency.
• We validate RoboPerform through extensive experiments
across music-to-dance and speech-to-gesture tasks, demon-
strating physically plausible, stylistically aligned, and real-
time synchronized motion, enabling freestyle performance
and embodied speech gestures.

2.1. Humanoid Whole-body Control
Traditional model-based whole-body control methods
achieve precise task execution via accurate dynamics mod-
els [5, 38], but suffer from intricate modeling and lim-
ited generalization across skills or unmodeled dynamics.
Learning-based paradigms rely on manually designed task-
specific rewards, succeeding in locomotion [41], jump-
ing [33], and fall recovery [11, 14, 21] while requiring elab-
orate reward engineering and struggling to generate human-
like motions. Some studies decompose control into inde-
pendent policies [19, 48], compromising inter-body coordi-


nation, while others use hierarchical frameworks for tasks
like table tennis [39]. Whole-body motion tracking offers
a paradigm shift [7]: it takes human motion as reference,
formulating a unified control goal that obviates task-specific
reward design and inherently fosters human-like coordina-
tion across diverse skills.
2.2. Humanoid Motion Tracking
Humanoid motion tracking learns lifelike behaviors from
human motion data. DeepMimic [32] pioneers a phase-based
framework with random initialization and early termination
for single-motion imitation. ASAP [9] addresses the sim-
to-real gap via a multi-stage pipeline with a delta-action
model for dynamic skills. HuB [47] and KungfuBot [43] use
elaborate processing to accurately imitate highly dynamic
single motions.
For unified multi-motion policies, OmniH2O [8] intro-
duces a universal controller inspiring subsequent works. Ex-
Body2 [16] enhances expressiveness via target decomposi-
tion and filtering. TWIST [46] and CLONE [20] achieve
high-quality tracking but are tailored to teleoperation and
low-dynamic motions. BumbleBee [42] uses motion cluster-
ing, expert policy training, and distillation. GMT [4] enables
robust dynamic motion tracking by prioritizing root velocity
and pose over global position. UniTracker [44] supports
dynamic tracking but lacks stability in long sequences due to
global target dependence. BeyondMimic [25] achieves high-
fidelity single-motion tracking via specialized objectives and
system identification, further using a distilled diffusion pol-
icy for task control. Kungfubot2 proposes an orthogonal
MoE for general motion tracking, enabling versatile skill
learning. Building on these, we develop a universal pol-
icy for audio-driven humanoid action generation, endowing
humanoids with the ability to perform.
2.3. Modality-driven Humanoid Locomotion
Recent works explore language-guided locomotion. Lang-
WBC [36] trains a compact auxiliary network for online mo-
tion generation but lacks scalability to complex distributions
and unseen instructions. RLPF [45] finetunes an LLM with
physical feasibility feedback from a tracking policy to align
semantics with kinematics, but risks catastrophic forgetting
due to decoder-focused gradient updates. RoboGhost [23]
proposes a latent-driven retargeting-free framework to re-
duce error accumulation and latency, treating locomotion
as a generation task but only using language as input. In
this work, we first leverage audio modality as a conditioning
signal for humanoid locomotion, achieving "motion synchro-
nized with sound."
3. Method
3.1. Overview
We present a novel audio-driven framework for humanoid
motion generation, eliminating error-prone retargeting to
enable stylistically aligned, physically plausible actions via
fused audio semantics and motion control. As shown in Fig-
ure 2, its core includes three components: a Delta Mixture
of Experts (∆MoE) teacher policy, an InfoNCE-optimized
audio-motion alignment module, and a diffusion-based stu-
dent policy with content-style disentanglement. It addresses
generating expressive motions (e.g., dance and gesture) di-
rectly from audio without motion templates or pose estima-
tion.
It begins with audio-motion alignment: an adaptor aug-
mented with temporal attention processes raw audio latents
laudio, aligning them with motion latents lmotion via the In-
foNCE loss.
This design embeds kinematic priors into
audio latents, obviating the need for a dedicated audio-to-
motion generator and ensuring rhythmic consistency be-
tween audio and motion. For robust teacher policy training,
we propose ∆MoE, which partitions 3D conditional inputs
into nested subspaces {Si}4
i=1 for four experts. A gating
network dynamically weights experts via residual fusion
(a = w1a1 +P4
i=2 wi(ai −ai−1)), eliminating redundancy
and enhancing expert complementarity. We then distill this
oracle policy into a diffusion-based student policy grounded
in the "motion=content+style" insight: motion latents from
pretrained motion generator guide denoising, while aligned
audio latents are injected across diffusion layers to modulate
rhythmic expression.
By integrating alignment, specialized teaching, and dis-
entangled diffusion control, our framework achieves direct
audio-to-action mapping with low latency and strong gener-
alization. It uniquely enables audio-driven freestyle dance
and speech-accompanied gestures, setting a new paradigm
for retargeting-free, expressive humanoid control.
3.2. Delta Mixture of Experts
To maximize the diversity and complementarity of knowl-
edge learned by different components, each of which pro-
cesses a distinct subset of input conditions, we propose
∆MoE as the teacher policy in Figure 3. The core design of
∆MoE hinges on nested conditional subspace partitioning
and residual incremental learning, which enforces mutual
complementarity among experts while eliminating informa-
tion redundancy. Fundamentally, ∆MoE can be interpreted
as a structured generalization of Classifier-Free Guidance
(CFG) [12] to continuous, multi-dimensional conditional
settings, providing a rigorous theoretical foundation for its
residual fusion mechanism.
We formalize conditional inputs as a 3D vector c =
[c1, c2, c3]T ∈R3. In standard CFG, models are trained

We propose that motion=content+style. Thus, we fix the motion latent as a constant condition and leverage different audio signals as style
modulation signals to generate actions adaptive to diverse rhythms.

in both conditional p(a | c) and unconditional p(a) forms,
with inference leveraging interpolated fusion:
a ∝p(a | c)γ
p(a)1−γ
In the log-space, this translates to an additive update that
balances conditional alignment and unconditional diversity:
∇a log p(a | c) + (γ −1)∇a log p(a | c)
p(a)
∆MoE extends this core insight to a nested hierarchy of par-
tial conditions, defining a filtration of conditional subspaces:
{0} = S1 ⊂S2 ⊂S3 ⊂S4 = R3
∆MoE employs 4 experts {ei}4
i=1, where each expert
ei models a policy πi(a | cSi) that depends solely on the
subspace Si: e1 takes S1 = {0} as input (modeling the
unconditional prior p(a)), e2 conditions on S2 = {c1, 0, 0},
e3 uses S3 = {c1, c2, 0} as input, e4 conditions on S4 =
{c1, c2, c3}, modeling the full conditional p(a | c).
A gating network processes c to output normalized
weights w = [w1, ..., w4]T (P wk = 1). Residual fusion
yields the final action:
a = w1a1 +

i=2
wi(ai −ai−1)
where ai is ei’s output, and ∆ai = ai −ai−1 (a0 = 0)
denotes the marginal contribution of introducing the i-th
conditional dimension. This formulation is equivalent to a


weighted sum of conditional increments:
a =
4
X
i=1
wi∆ai,
where ∆ai = E[a | cSi] −E[a | cSi−1]
Each ∆ai directly analogizes to the guidance term in
CFG, quantifying the “information gain” from adding the
i-th conditional dimension, just as CFG’s residual term disen-
tangles conditional and unconditional signals, ∆ai ensures
non-overlapping contributions across experts. This disentan-
glement eliminates information redundancy while enforcing
mutual complementarity: experts do not compete for shared
signals but instead specialize in distinct conditional incre-
ments.
We adopt ∆MoE as our oracle policy, which takes both
robot state observations and reference motion as input, and
outputs the final action at optimized with several rewards.
By generalizing CFG’s residual contrast to hierarchical con-
ditional subspaces, ∆MoE achieves both precise conditional
alignment via structured incremental learning and robust
generalization via complementary expert knowledge.
3.3. Audio-Motion Alignment
To directly guide action generation by conditioning the pol-
icy on the audio latent, thereby circumventing the need to
train a dedicated audio-to-motion generator, we endow the
audio latent with kinematic information. Specifically, we
train an audio adaptor to align the audio latent laudio with the
motion latent lmotion. The adaptor consists of a 6-layer Trans-
former [40] that processes the audio latent, augmented with
temporal attention to capture rhythmic structures inherent in
the audio. The motion latent is extracted from our pretrained
VAE, and the entire alignment process is optimized using the
InfoNCE loss [30], effectively embedding kinematic priors
into the audio latent through the adaptor.
Formally, given a batch of N paired audio-motion latents
{(l(i)
audio, l(i)
motion)}N
i=1, we treat each pair (i, i) as a positive
sample and all other (i, j) with j ̸= i as negative samples.
Let sim(u, v) =
u⊤v
τ
denote the scaled cosine similarity
between two normalized latent vectors, where τ > 0 is
a temperature hyperparameter. The InfoNCE loss is then
defined as:
LInfoNCE = −1

This objective encourages the adaptor to map audio latents
closer to their corresponding motion latents in the embedding
space while pushing them away from unrelated ones.
3.4. Audio-conditioned Policy Distill
We posit that motion=content+style. In the context of dance
or gesture, the audio serves primarily as a style cue, modu-
lating the underlying motion content in accordance with its
rhythmic and temporal structure. To instantiate this disentan-
glement, we first encode high-level semantic descriptions,
e.g., “The person is dancing to the music” or “The person is
giving a speech” into a motion latent using a pretrained mo-
tion generator. During training, all motions share the same
motion latent, which provides the content of the generated
action. This motion latent is then employed as the primary
conditioning signal to guide the denoising process in the
diffusion model.
Subsequently, the aligned audio latent is injected as an
external style control signal into the diffusion backbone at
multiple layers, which can be formulated as:
oi = Layeri
 oi−1, lmotion

+ αlaudio,
(2)
where oi denotes the output of layer i. This progressive
injection steers the denoising trajectory toward rhythmically
stylized motion, effectively modulating the base motion con-
tent in an audio-aware manner.
Follwing a DAgger-like approach [34], we roll out the
student policy in simulation and query the teacher for op-
timal actions ˆa at visited states. We employ a diffusion
model as the student policy to perform action denoising. The
forward process progressively corrupts the clean action a
by adding Gaussian noise over T timesteps, yielding noisy
samples xt = √¯αt a + √1 −¯αt ϵ, where ϵ ∼N(0, I) and
¯αt = Qt
s=1 αs denotes the cumulative signal-to-noise ratio
at timestep t. For tractability, we adopt an x0-prediction pa-
rameterization, where the student policy ϵθ(xt, t) is trained
to predict the original clean action a. Specifically, we de-
fine the reconstructed action as ˆat = xt−√1−¯αt ϵθ(xt,t)
√¯αt
and
supervise the model by minimizing the mean squared error
loss L = ∥a −ˆat∥2

4. Experiments
We evaluate RoboPerform on two tasks, including music-
driven and speech-driven humanoid control, and rigorously
assess whether humanoid locomotion can be effectively gen-
erated from audio alone. Specifically, the input audio is first
encoded and then processed by a pretrained adaptor to pro-
duce a representation aligned with the motion latent space,
which is subsequently fed into a policy network to generate
executable actions. In our experiments, both the teacher
and student policies are trained in the IsaacGym simulation
environment, and the student policy is directly deployed on
the Unitree G1 humanoid robot for real-world validation.
4.1. Experimental Setups
Dataset
We train our model on FineDance [18] and
BEAT2 [26] datasets. BEAT2 has 76 hours of data from
30 speakers, standardized into a mesh representation with
paired audio. FineDance is a fine-grained 3D full-body

dataset, which has 7.7 hours of dance motion. It provides
the SMPL-H [31] format motion data and music feature ex-
tracted by librosa. All motions are sampled at 30FPS. Due
to the excessive length of the original data, we segment each
motion sequence and its corresponding audio into 10-second
clips for both training and evaluation.
Metrics
We adopt two categories of evaluation metrics:
audio-motion retrieval and motion tracking.
For audio-
motion retrieval, we only report retrieval precision R@1,2,3
to evaluate the ability of audio adaptor. For motion tracking,
evaluated in physics simulators aligning with prior works [8],
we use success rate as the core indicator, supplemented
by mean per-joint position error (EMPJPE) and mean per-
keypoint position error (EMPKPE). Detailed metric definitions
are provided in the Appendix.
Implementation Details
In ∆MoE, we employ 4 MLP-
based experts together with an MLP gating network that
assigns a weight to each expert.
Since the FineDance
dataset provides pre-encoded music features, we do not
train a music encoder; however, for speech from the BEAT2
dataset, we adopt the temporal convolutional network from
EMAGE [26] to learn speech representations. We train a
9-layer, 4-head transformer as the motion VAE and a 6-layer,
4-head transformer as the music adaptor, where temporal
attention is explicitly incorporated to capture temporal dy-
namics. During DAgger training, we utilize a 4-layer MLP
as the backbone of the diffusion model, with conditioning in-
jected via AdaLN [15]. At inference, we employ a two-step
DDIM sampling [37] schedule to ensure real-time perfor-
mance during deployment. Further details regarding policy
training can be found in the Appendix.
Figure 5. Ablation study on tracking performance of music-to-
dance and speech-to-gesture tasks in IsaacGym and MuJoCo. The
baseline uses pretrained motion generators for each task to generate
motions, which drive the student policy for action generation.
4.2. Evaluation of Audio-Motion Retrieval
To evaluate the alignment capability of the audio adaptor, we
conduct alignment evaluation on the test sets of FineDance
and BEAT2, specifically assessing whether the model can
accurately align a given audio segment to the motion latent
space to retrieve the corresponding motion latent. The results
are shown in Table 1.
4.3. Evaluation of Motion Tracking
To further validate the motion tracking performance of our
policy, we evaluate it on two audio-driven locomotion tasks:
speech-to-locomotion and music-to-locomotion, reporting
task success rate, Empjpe, Empkpe in IsaacGym and MuJoCo.
The pipeline operates as follows: (i) the input audio is en-
coded and processed by our trained adaptor to inject kine-
matic priors into the audio features; (ii) the resulting motion-
aligned latent representation conditions the student policy
to generate physically executable actions. As shown in Ta-
ble 2, our method achieves high task success rates on both
the FineDance and BEAT2 datasets, along with low joint and
keypoint errors, indicating strong alignment between audio
semantics and feasible locomotion trajectories. The baseline
employs pretrained models EMAGE [26] and FineNet [18]
to first generate a deterministic motion, which is then retar-
geted to G1 and executed by an explicit motion-driven policy
based MLP.
4.4. Qualitative Results
We conduct a qualitative assessment of the motion tracking
policy across three deployment settings: simulation (Isaac-
Gym), cross-simulator transfer (MuJoCo), and real-world
execution on the Unitree G1 humanoid robot. Figure 6

quences for execution. The time cost reports the full infer-
ence latency, baseline encompasses both motion generation
and retargeting; specifically, we employ a 1000-iteration
PBHC retargeting [43] procedure. As shown in Figure 5,
such explicit action generation not only incurs additional
computational overhead but also degrades task success rates
and introduces extra tracking error.
∆MoE Vs Vanilla MoE
To investigate the performance
gain introduced by our ∆MoE, we conduct an ablation study
comparing the tracking performance of vanilla MoE and ∆
MoE. As shown in Table 3, ∆MoE yields consistently more
accurate tracking.
Additionally, we visualize every component in MoE using
t-SNE. For vanilla MoE, each component corresponds to the
output of an individual expert. As illustrated in Figure 4
(b), the features learned by each expert exhibit significant
overlap, failing to achieve mutually independent information
specialization across experts. In contrast, the components
of ∆MoE correspond to the differences between experts
conditioned on distinct signals (except for the first expert,
which is conditioned on a zero vector). As shown in Figure 4
(a), we perform clustering on {a1, a2 −a1, . . . , a4 −a3}.
The results demonstrate that each component is mutually
independent, which fully exploits the capacity of individual
experts and enhances generalization. This mechanism is
analogous to creating a complete painting: starting with
a blank canvas, we incrementally add contour and color
information, where each stroke introduces non-redundant
details until the artwork is fully realized.
With Content Vs Without Content
We posit that motion
can be decomposed into content and style. For expressive
motions such as dance and speech gestures, audio serves
primarily as a style modulation signal that shapes the tempo-
ral structure, such as rhythm and beat patterns, rather than
prescribing fine-grained kinematics. Accordingly, we treat
the content latent from a pretrained motion generative model

as the primary control signal, and progressively inject audio
features into the diffusion process to modulate the denoising
trajectory. Herein, LaMP-T2M [22] is adopted as the motion
generator for both tasks. For the music-to-dance task, the in-
put text is "The person is dancing to the music", while for the
speech-to-gesture task, the input text is "The person is giving
a speech". This design ensures that the generated actions
preserve semantic content while aligning with the temporal
dynamics of the input audio. As shown in Table 4, policies
conditioned on the content latent achieve significantly more
accurate tracking performance.
With Adaptor Vs Without Adaptor
To demonstrate that
enriching the control signal with kinematic information leads
to more accurate and rhythmically coherent action genera-
tion, we conduct an ablation study on the use of the audio
adaptor. As shown in Table 5, when the control signal is
aligned with the motion latent space and imbued with kine-
matic cues via the adaptor, it more effectively guides motion
synthesis, yielding improved tracking accuracy and stronger
rhythmic alignment. Additionally, we report the rhythm
hit rate, a metric quantifying the temporal correspondence
between generated motions and musical beats.
5. Conclusion
We present RoboPerform, a retargeting-free audio-to-
locomotion framework that unifies music-driven dance and
speech-driven co-speech gesture generation for humanoids.
By formulating motion = content + style, our approach lever-
ages a pretrained motion latent for semantic grounding and
injects rhythm-aware audio features into a diffusion-based
policy. Our proposed ∆MoE enhances behavioral diversity,
while content-style disentanglement ensures temporally co-
herent and physically plausible execution. RoboPerform
achieves better tracking performance and faster speed during
deployment. It reframes humanoid control as an expressive
act, answering the question: Yes, humanoids can freestyle.

6. Implementation Details
This section details the state representation for policy train-
ing, including proprioceptive states, privileged information,
and network hyperparameters. As summarized in Table 6,
the proprioceptive state components are shared between the
teacher and student policies, with a critical distinction: the
student policy leverages an extended observation history to
compensate for the absence of privileged information, sub-
stituting temporal context for direct auxiliary signals.
Our proprioceptive information includes joint positions,
joint velocities, root angular velocity, root projected grav-
ity, and the aforementioned information from four historical
frames, which is elaborated in Table 6. For privileged infor-
mation, it forms the observation of the critic network together
with proprioceptive information. Unlike prior works where
both teacher and student policies receive explicit reference
motion as part of observations, our framework restricts these
target signals exclusively to the teacher. By contrast, the
student policy additionally takes proprioceptive states from
25 historical frames, motion latents for content representa-
tion, and audio latents for style representation as inputs. The
audio latents first feed into a pretrained adaptor to infuse
kinematic information. Full details of the target state are
provided in Table 7. Both policies output 23-dimensional
target joint positions.
The teacher policy is trained via PPO [35], taking privi-
leged information, motion tracking targets, and propriocep-
tive states as inputs, which are concatenated and processed
by ∆MoE. The first expert takes all zeros as conditions to
predict action a1. The second expert only receives propri-
oceptive states as conditions, with all remaining positions
filled with zeros. This pattern continues such that the fourth
expert accepts all conditions to output action a4. The final
action is obtained through a weighted sum of the outputs of
all experts, where the weights wi are generated by a gating
network. The student policy is trained with DAgger, lacking
access to privileged information and explicit reference mo-
tion, instead relying on extended observation histories and
audio latent representations to enable a retargeting-free, au-
dio latent-driven pipeline. First, audio features are extracted
from the input audio. Then, our pretrained adaptor is uti-
lized to infuse kinematic information into the audio features,
enabling them to guide humanoid action generation more
effectively. The inputs of student policy are concatenated
and fed as conditions to a diffusion model with an MLP
backbone, where AdaLN injects conditional signals through-
out the denoising process. A final MLP layer projects the
backbone output to the 23-dimensional action space, with
conditional signals further integrated for alignment. Detailed
hyperparameters for both policies are listed in Table 8.
Motion Filter and Retargeting
Following [43], we quan-
tify stability by computing the ground-projected distance
between the center of mass (CoM) and center of pressure
(CoP) for each frame, with a predefined stability threshold.
Let ¯pCoM
t
= (pCoM
t,x , pCoM
t,y ) and ¯pCoP
t
= (pCoP
t,x , pCoP
t,y ) repre-
sent the 2D ground projections of CoM and CoP at frame
t, respectively. We define ∆dt = ∥¯pCoM
t
−¯pCoP
t
∥2 as this
distance. A frame is considered stable if ∆dt < ϵstab. A
motion sequence is retained if its first and last frames are
stable, and the longest consecutive unstable segment has
fewer than 100 frames.
Simulator
Following established protocols in motion
tracking policy research [9, 16], we adopt a three-stage
evaluation pipeline: first, large-scale reinforcement learning
training in IsaacGym; second, zero-shot transfer to MuJoCo
to assess cross-simulator generalization; third, physical de-
ployment on the Unitree G1 humanoid platform to validate
real-world performance.
Reference State Initialization
Task initialization is criti-
cal for reinforcement learning (RL) training. We observe that
naively initializing episodes at the start of reference motions
often leads to policy failure, especially for complex motions.
This can cause the environment to overfit to simpler frames,
neglecting the most challenging motion segments.
To address this, we adopt the Reference State Initializa-
tion (RSI) framework [32]. Specifically, we uniformly sam-
ple time-phase variables over [0,1] to randomize the starting
point within the reference motion that the policy must track.

The robot’s state, including root position, orientation, linear
and angular velocities, and joint positions and velocities,
is then initialized to the reference motion’s values at the
sampled phase. This approach enhances motion tracking
performance, particularly for highly dynamic whole-body
motions, by enabling the policy to learn diverse movement
segments in parallel rather than being constrained to strictly
sequential learning.
Domain Randomization and Regularization
To improve
the robustness and generalization of the pretrained policy,
we utilize the domain randomization techniques and regular-
ization items, which are listed in Table 9.

Motion Tracking Rewards
As shown in Table 10, we
define the reward function as the sum of task rewards and
regularization, which are meticulously designed to improve
both the performance and motion realism of the humanoid
robot. Following [43], we enforce penalties for joint posi-
tions exceeding soft limits, which are symmetrically derived
from hard limits via a fixed scaling ratio (α = 0.95). Specif-
ically, the midpoint m and range d of hard limits are first
computed as:
m = qmin + qmax
2
,
(3)
d = qmax −qmin,
(4)
where qmin and qmax denote the hard limits of joint position
q. The soft limits are then determined by:
qsoft-min = m −0.5 · d · α,
(5)
qsoft-max = m + 0.5 · d · α.
(6)
This computation extends to joint velocity ˙q and torque τ for
their respective soft limits.

Curriculum Learning
To imitate highly dynamic motions,
we follow [43], introduce two curriculum mechanisms: a
termination curriculum that gradually reduces tracking er-
ror tolerance, and a penalty curriculum that progressively
increases the weight of regularization terms to promote more
stable and physically plausible behaviors.
• Termination Curriculum: The episode is terminated early
when the humanoid’s motion deviates from the reference
beyond a termination threshold θ. During training, this
threshold is gradually decreased to increase the difficulty:
θ ←clip (θ · (1 −δ), θmin, θmax) ,
(7)
where the initial threshold θ = 1.5, with bounds θmin =
0.3, θmax = 2.0, and decay rate δ = 2.5 × 10−5.
• Penalty Curriculum: To facilitate learning in the early
training stages while gradually enforcing stronger regu-
larization, we introduce a scaling factor α that increases
progressively to modulate the influence of the penalty
term:
α ←clip (α · (1 + δ), αmin, αmax) ,
ˆrpenalty ←α·rpenalty,
(8)
where the initial penalty scale α = 0.1, with bounds
αmin = 0.0, αmax = 1.0, and growth rate δ = 1.0 × 10−4.
Adaptive Sigma
Inspired by [43], we employ adaptive
sigma in the reward function. Task-specific rewards enforce
alignment of joint states, rigid body states, and foot contact
masks. All except the foot contact term adopt a bounded
exponential form:
A = exp

−x2
σ2

,
where x denotes tracking error and σ controls error toler-
ance. This form outperforms negative error terms by stabi-
lizing training and simplifying reward weighting.
7. Evaluation Details
Motion Tracking Metrics
For motion tracking evaluation,
we employ metrics standard in prior work [16]: Success Rate
(Succ), Mean Per Joint Position Error (EMPJPE), and Mean
Per Keybody Position Error (EMPKPE).
• Success Rate (Succ): Evaluates whether the humanoid
successfully follows the reference motion without falling.
A trial fails if the average trajectory deviation exceeds 0.5
meters at any point, or if the root pitch angle exceeds a
predefined threshold.
• Mean Per Joint Position Error (EMPJPE, in rad): Quanti-
fies joint-level tracking accuracy via the average error in
degree-of-freedom (DoF) rotations between reference and
generated motions.
• Mean Per Keybody Position Error (EMPKPE, in m): As-
sesses keypoint tracking performance using the average
positional discrepancy between reference and generated
keypoint trajectories.


Motion-Audio Alignment Metrics
We evaluate our audio
adaptor using motion-audio alignment metrics: retrieval ac-
curacy (R@1, R@2, R@3), Multimodal Distance (MMDist),
and Beat Alignment Score (BAS) [17].
• Retrieval Accuracy (R-Precision): These metrics measure
the relevance of audio to corresponding motion in a re-
trieval setup. R@1 denotes the fraction of audio queries
for which the correct motion is retrieved as the top match,
reflecting the model’s precision in identifying the most
relevant motion. R@2 and R@3 extend this notion, indi-
cating recall within the top two and three retrieved motions,
respectively.
• Multimodal Distance (MMDist): This quantifies the aver-
age feature-space distance between audios and their cor-
responding motions, typically extracted via a pretrained
retrieval model. Smaller MMDist values indicate stronger
semantic alignment between audio and motion.
• Beat Alignment Score (BAS): This metric evaluates the
temporal alignment quality between kinematic beats and
music beats. Audio beats are detected from audio sig-
nals using Librosa [29], yielding a timestamp sequence
By = {tj
y} where tj
y denotes the time of the j-th music
beat. Kinematic beats are identified as the local minima of
the motion’s kinetic velocity, capturing the key rhythmic
frames of the motion sequence, resulting in a timestamp
sequence Bx = {ti
x} where ti
x denotes the time of the i-th
kinematic beat. The BAS metric is defined as the average
of exponential-weighted distances between each kinematic
beat and its nearest music beat. This exponential formu-
lation emphasizes closer alignments while mitigating the
impact of large discrepancies, and it is normalized via a
parameter σ to adapt to sequences with fixed FPS. The
formal definition is:

where m is the number of kinematic beats in Bx. Consis-

across all evaluations.
7.1. Deployment Details
Sim-to-Sim Transfer
As noted in Humanoid-Gym [6],
MuJoCo delivers more realistic dynamics than Isaac Gym.
Aligning with standard protocols in motion tracking policy
research [16], we conduct reinforcement learning training in
Isaac Gym to capitalize on its high computational efficiency.
To evaluate policy robustness and generalization capabil-
ity, we perform zero-shot transfer to the MuJoCo simulator.
This sim-to-sim transfer serves as an intermediate validation
step before deploying the policy on a physical humanoid
robot to verify the real-world motion tracking efficacy of our
framework.

matic information into the audio modality. It can be observed that
the adaptor successfully aligns the audio and motion, improving
the tracking performance and success rate.
Sim-to-Real Deployment
Real-world experiments are
conducted on a Unitree G1 humanoid robot, integrated with
an onboard Jetson Orin NX module for computation and
communication. The control policy processes motion track-
ing targets to generate target joint positions, then transmits
control commands to the robot’s low-level controller at 50Hz,
with a communication latency of 18–30ms. The low-level
controller operates at 500Hz to guarantee stable real-time ac-
tuation. Communication between the high-level policy and
low-level interface is implemented via Lightweight Commu-
nications and Marshalling (LCM) [13].
8. Additional Experiments
Audio-Motion Alignment
To evaluate whether the co-
speech gestures or dance motions generated by the robot
adhere to rhythmic patterns, we compute the BAS for suc-
cessful cases in the test set. Specifically, we retrieve the joint
velocity of the robot’s motors and calculate the BAS value
by correlating it with music beats. The results are presented
in Table 11, where the Baseline corresponds to the outcome
of concatenating music latents with other observations and
motion latents as inputs to the student policy. It can be ob-
served that when music is treated as an external condition to
further modulate the content, the generated actions exhibit
superior rhythmic alignment.
Denoising Steps in Student Policy
We evaluate DDIM
sampling with different denoising steps, measuring aver-
age per-action step time. Table 12 shows that increasing
steps leads to higher latency, which is critical for real-world
humanoid robot deployment as latency degrades execution
outcomes.
Noise Scale in Student Policy
We ablate the noise scale
βmax for DDIM sampling to study its impact on performance
and latency. Table 13 shows that βmax = 0.20 achieves
optimal success rate.

Table 14 shows that deterministic DDIM achieves the highest
success rate and lowest latency. Stochastic strategies reduce
performance and increase latency.

supervision targets for the diffusion policy: ϵ-prediction and
x0-prediction. Table 15 shows that x0-prediction achieves
significantly better tracking performance compared to ϵ-
prediction.

of the condition space, we split the condition into N −1
partitions when training ∆MoE with different N experts. A
critical constraint is that each condition partition ci must con-
tain complete information. For instance, the dof positions in
proprioceptive states must not be split in both c1 and c2.
As shown in Table 16, the optimal performance is
achieved when the number of experts is set to 4. Further-
more, we verify that with a fixed number of experts, the
partitioning of conditions has a negligible impact on the
results, which is presented in Table 17.
9. Qualitative Results
Simulation
To validate the advantages of the diffusion
policy in such conditional control tasks, we visualize two
cases in simulation. As shown in the upper part of Figure 7,
the MLP policy exhibits poor tracking performance. In con-
trast, the diffusion policy achieves superior tracking results
by leveraging its enhanced robustness and ability to model
distributions.
Furthermore, we verify the freestyle capability of our
policy. As illustrated in the lower part of Figure 7, when
fed with a piece of music unseen during training to generate
actions, the diffusion policy successfully completes the en-
tire motion sequence due to its strong generalization ability,
whereas the MLP policy immediately results in a fall.
Retargeting Method
When training the teacher oracle pol-
icy, we investigate diverse retargeting approaches, encom-
passing PHC [27] and GMR [1]. While GMR demonstrates
robust performance in mitigating motion penetration, it gives
rise to abrupt motion transitions, as visualized in Figure 8.
Thus, we ultimately select PHC as the designated retargeting
method for subsequent experimental evaluations. The related
