Abstract—The early detection of pancreatic neoplasm is a 
major clinical dilemma, and it is predominantly so because 
tumors are likely to occur with minimal contrast margins and a 
large spread anatomy-wide variation amongst patients on a CT 
scan. These complexities require to be addressed with an 
effective and scalable system that can assist in enhancing the 
salience of the subtle visual cues and provide a high level of the 
generalization on the multimodal imaging data. A Scalable 
Residual Feature Aggregation (SRFA) framework is proposed 
to be used to meet these conditions in this study. The framework 
integrates a pipeline of preprocessing followed by the 
segmentation using the MAGRes-UNet that is effective in 
making the pancreatic structures and isolating regions of 
interest more visible. DenseNet-121 performed with residual 
feature storage is used to extract features to allow deep 
hierarchical features to be aggregated without properties loss. 
To go further, hybrid HHO-BA metaheuristic feature selection 
strategy is used, which guarantees the best feature subset 
refinement. To be classified, the system is trained based on a new 
hybrid model that integrates the ability to pay attention on the 
world, which is the Vision Transformer (ViT) with the high 
representational 
efficiency 
of 
EfficientNet-B3. 
A 
dual 
optimization mechanism incorporating SSA and GWO is used 
to fine-tune hyperparameters to enhance greater robustness and 
less overfitting. Experimental results support the significant 
improvement in performance, with the suggested model 
reaching 96.23% accuracy, 95.58% F1-score and 94.83% 
specificity, the model is significantly better than the traditional 
CNNs and contemporary transformer-based models. Such 
results highlight the possibility of the SRFA framework as a 
useful instrument in the early detection of pancreatic tumors.

I. INTRODUCTION  
Pancreatic cancer has been ranked as one of the deadliest 
malignancies in the world mainly because it is a silent killer 
and normally diagnosed at very late stages [1], [2]. The early 
lesions are usually small, subtle, and lodged in the low-
contrast abdominal structures and are very difficult to identify 
with the conventional CT-scanning [3], [4]. The conventional 
CNN-based diagnostic systems have even more problems 
with the fact that inter-patient variability is high, the 
morphology of organs is complicated, and the signal-to-noise 
of pancreatic tissue foci is low [5]. These aspects tend to 
produce 
performance 
inconsistencies, 
abnormalities 
omissions, or inaccurate forecasts. As such, a very 
sophisticated pipeline, integrating with sturdy preprocessing, 
precise segmentation and multi-tier feature boosting, is 
required to achieve reliable early detection [6]. 
To counter these constraints, this paper presents a 
complete end-to-end combined architecture that aims at 
enhancing the robustness of features representation and 
classification. The method takes advantage of the residual 
feature stores, where the deeper layers store and reuse the 
important intermediate patterns without degrading the 
gradient. At the same time hybrid metaheuristic optimization 
optimizes the space of features, so that only the most useful 
features are used in making final predictions. The 
combination of global contextual information with local 
effective features, a hybrid transformer-CNN classifier is 
used to promote further generalization between multimodal 
CT scans. The extensive experimental validation supports the 
fact that the suggested workflow is consistently better than 
the traditional architectures and has a higher level of stability, 
sensitivity, and diagnostic accuracy in general.

with an introduction where it describes the clinical impetus 
and the obstacles related to the early detection of neoplasm of 
the pancreas. This is then preceded by a comprehensive 
methodology section that explains the preprocessing pipeline, 
segmentation model, feature extraction strategy, hybrid

performance metrics, and comparison with the current 
models. Lastly, the paper will conclude by summarizing the 
main findings and pointing out possible future work 
directions. The implementation of the proposed framework is 
publicly available online [16]. 
II. LITERATURE REVIEW 
The recent work has shown that deep learning on CT 
scans can detect pancreatic cancer but each of the studied has 
its limitations that our structure will overcome. As a case in 
point, Pancreatic Cancer Detection on CT scans with Deep 
Learning created an end-to-end CNN-based model that was 
instructed on a big, real-world dataset with approximately 
89.7% sensitivity and 92.8% specificity even on tumors 
smaller than 2 cm [7]. Nevertheless, their approach is heavily 
based on general CNN classification without fined-grained 
attention-based segmentation or sophisticated preprocessing, 
which can be a weakness in its ability to identify lesions with 
small margins [7].  
In the segmentation aspect, MAGRes UNet: Improved 
Medical Image Segmentation through a Multi Attention 
Gated Residual U Net improves the classical U-Net by 
incorporating the multi-attention gates and residual block to 
target small scale tumors and reduce the noise response of the 
background. Despite this enhancing the quality of 
segmentation, individually it fails to cope with feature-
selection optimization or classification robustness among 
different CT modalities [8]. 3D U-Net architectures have also 
been applied to detect pancreatic head tumors in other works, 
like Improved Pancreatic Cancer Detection and Localization 
on CT using a Multistage 3D U Net Framework incorporating 
Secondary Features, where secondary signs (such as duct 
dilation) relevant to clinicians have been added after the 3D 
U-Net architecture. Their method has high sensitivity and 
specificity in both local and external validations, although 
their method can be constrained by small dataset sizes and 
low generalization in larger, heterogeneous populations [9].  
A more recent article, Deep Learning-based Automatic 
Detection of Small PDAC using 3D CNN on High Resolution 
CT, integrates 3D-CNN mass detection with indirect 
measures (e.g., pancreatic duct to parenchyma ratio) to detect 
smaller early-stage tumors better. Although they have higher 
small-tumor sensitivity, these methods are still confronted 
with large, annotated 3D datasets requirements and they 
might not be able to handle noise and inter-patient variation 
[10].  
Extensive reviews like A Review of Deep Learning and 
Radiomics Approaches in Pancreatic Cancer Diagnosis in 
Medical Imaging are a summary that even though deep 
learning and radiomics have potential to diagnose pancreatic 
cancer at an early stage, several problems are still persistent, 
such as the inability to generalize and results across centers, 
heterogeneity in the data used, or the variability of imaging 
procedures [11] [12]. Lastly, in non-pancreatic segmentation 
studies, improved versions of U-Net that add residual units or 
attention (e.g. as in Medical Image Segmentation Using 
Enhanced Residual U Net) have presented better boundary 
delineation on MRI brain tumor tasks. It is however not trivial 
to directly apply such architectures to pancreatic CT because 
of variations in abdominal organs, and they lack feature-
selection or classification modules by default [13] [14]. 
Altogether, this preceding research indicates the merits of 
CNN- and U-Net-based methods, attention-enhanced 
segmentation, and 3D-CNN to detect small tumors - but also 
together bring up the shortcomings in noise tolerance, inter-
protocol variability, high-dimensional feature space, and 
inter-dataset generalization. Our suggested framework seals 
these gaps together in terms of robust preprocessing, 
attention-based 
segmentation, 
dense 
residual 
feature 
aggregation, hybrid metaheuristic feature selection and a 
fusion classifier optimized through advanced search 
algorithms - to have a more generalizable and high-
performing solution to early pancreatic neoplasm detection. 
III. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY 
The suggested procedure applies a complete modular and 
scalable approach to the early detection of pancreatic 
neoplasm with multimodal CT. The pipeline starts with a 
preprocessing step, which is further enhanced using CLAHE, 
Gaussian blurring, median filtering, and normalization, which 
enhance the contrast and reduce noise without affecting the 
anatomical details. The MAGRes-UNet model is then used to 
segment cells and isolate pancreatic regions and tumor 
structures with accuracy using attention gating and residual 
learning. After segmentation, features are extracted with 
DenseNet-121 with Residual Feature Stores (RFS), which 
have the ability of rich hierarchical feature aggregation 
without gradient flow loss. A hybrid metaheuristic feature 
selection method (Harris Hawks Optimization) with the Bat 
Algorithm) is used to eliminate redundancy and improve the 
discriminative power. Lastly, the classification is performed 
based on a hybrid deep model that combines the universal 
attention features of the Vision Transformer (ViT) and the 
high efficiency of features of EfficientNet-B3. To optimize 
the parameters of the classifier, a dual metaheuristic method, 
Sparrow Search Algorithm (SSA) and Grey Wolf 
Optimization (GWO) is used to achieve high accuracy and 
generalization at various modalities of CT. This is an end-to-
end approach that will provide an extremely secure and strong 
system to detect pancreatic tumors at an early stage. 
 
Fig. 1. Proposed Framework 
A. Dataset Description 
A multimodal pancreatic CT dataset is used in the study 
[15] and includes both normal and tumor samples, which 
provides a wide range of representation of anatomical 
structures and lesion variations. The data contains scans with 
axial view, contrast-enhanced phase pictures, which can 
capture the variations of tissue density, enhancement 
behavior, and organ morphology. This heterogeneity enables 


the model to understand small differences between normal 
and cancerous pancreatic regions to enhance the chances of 
detecting neoplasms at an early stage. Multimodality of the 
inputs provides a strong training provision and increases the 
generalization of the proposed framework with different 
imaging conditions. 
B. Preprocessing Pipeline 
Pre-processing is one of the required procedures, which 
enhance CT images in terms of their reliability in 
segmentation and feature extraction. This involves a series of 
steps that include enhancement of contrast, reduction of noise 
as well as balancing of intensities, which show tiny pancreatic 
lesions. The photos are cleaned with the help of multiple 
enhancement, smoothing, filtering, and normalization 
processes, the next stages of deep learning are becoming 
trained on clean, uniform, and diagnostically significant data. 
1) CLAHE Enhancement 
Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization 
(CLAHE) can improve the local intensities by performing the 
redistribution of pixel intensities in small contextual regions. 
It also prevents the noise to be clipped off by histogram 
mounds. A simplification of CLAHE is the expression (1): 
𝐼CLAHE = ClipLimit(
!"#(%)'!"#!"#
('!"#!"#
) 
(1) 
 
where CDF is the cumulative distribution function of 
pixel intensities. 
2) Gaussian Blur 
Gaussian blurring smooths the CT image by reducing 
high-frequency noise while preserving overall structure. It 
performs convolution with a Gaussian kernel: 
𝐼Gaussian(𝑥, 𝑦) = 𝐼∗𝐺)(𝑥, 𝑦) 
 
(2) 
 
where 
𝐺)(𝑥, 𝑦) =
(
*+)$ 𝑒'%$&'$
$($  
 
(3) 
 
and ∗denotes convolution. 
3) Median Filtering (3×3) 
Median filtering is used to remove salt-and- pepper noise 
by averaging the pixels of its surrounding. It keeps edges 
intact as compared to linear filters. 
𝐼Median(𝑥, 𝑦) = median{ 𝐼(𝑖, 𝑗)  ∣ (𝑖, 𝑗) ∈𝑁,×,(𝑥, 𝑦)}  (4) 
       4) Normalization (0–1 Scaling) 
Normalization is used to bring pixel values within a 
constant scale, enhancing numerical stability of a deep 
learning model. The normalization used is the min-max 
normalization as: 
𝐼norm =
%'%!"#
%!)*'%!"# 
 
 
(5) 
 
This guarantees even distribution of pixel intensity in the 
entire CT slices. 
C. Segmentation using MAGRes-UNet 
This step of segmentation uses Multi-Attention Gated 
Residual U-Net (MAGRes-UNet), developed to be used in 
order to identify the pancreas (and any tumor) in CT images 
with high accuracy. The above-mentioned model extends 
attention gates with the help of which the most significant 
spatial features are perceived when the background structures 
that are irrelevant are entirely removed by the network. Here, 
the residual blocks are employed to enhance the feature 
propagation and also minimizing the gradient degradation, 
which in turn enables the deeper layers to retain the 
significant contextual features. Additionally, besides that, 
multi-level feature fusion method has also been embraced 
which combines both high-resolution and semantic features 
thereby enhancing more accurate boundaries and capturing 
fine lesion features. All these elements work together and 
make it possible for MAGRes-UNet to produce excellent 
quality and trustworthy segmentation maps that are the 
backbone of the succeeding feature extraction and 
classification processes. 
D. Feature Extraction 
Feature extraction is carried out using DenseNet-121 
combined with Residual Feature Stores (RFS) to obtain rich 
and diverse representations from the segmented pancreatic 
regions. DenseNet-121 promotes dense connectivity among 
layers, which allows each layer to have access to the feature 
maps of all the preceding layers. This not only preserves fine-
grained spatial details but also improves the flow of gradients 
across the network. The use of RFS makes this ability even 
more powerful as it temporarily holds intermediate features 
from various depths thus allowing the model to merge low-
level textures and high-level semantics simultaneously. 
Therefore, the feature set that has been extracted becomes 
very descriptive but also very high-dimensional. In order to 
solve this problem, the framework applies a selective 
reduction strategy in the following stages, making sure that 
only the most informative and discriminative features are 
used in the classification process. This blend of dense 
connectivity and residual feature storage lays a strong 
foundation for precise tumor detection. 
 
E. Hybrid Metaheuristic Feature Selection 
The feature selection process applies a hybrid 
metaheuristic technique which merges Harris Hawks 
Optimization (HHO) with the Bat Algorithm (BA) in order to 
discover the most informative subset of features from the 
extensive feature space. HHO simulates the cooperative 
hunting strategy of Harris hawks by alternating between 
exploration and exploitation phases to look for the best 
feature combinations. The updating process can be 
represented very simply as: 
𝑋./( = 𝑋prey −𝐸⋅∣𝐽⋅𝑋prey −𝑋. ∣ 
(6) 
 
where 𝑋.is the current solution, 𝑋preyrepresents the best-
known solution, 𝐸controls escape energy, and 𝐽adjusts 
dynamic movement. 
The Bat Algorithm is an extension of this mechanism and 
tries to optimize solutions with the help of echolocation, 
optimizing solutions based on frequency, loudness, and pulse 
rate. Its simplistic position update may be stated as: 
𝑋./( = 𝑋. + 𝑣.with𝑣. = 𝑣.'( + (𝑋. −𝑋best) ⋅𝑓 (7) 
 
where 𝑣.is velocity, 𝑋bestis the current best solution, and 
𝑓is frequency. The hybrid selection method which fuses the 


two algorithms is not only effective in searching the search 
space but also helps select the promising features subsets 
accurately hence ensuring that only the most relevant features 
are passed through to be classified. 
F. Proposed Hybrid Classifier (SSA + GWO) 
The hybrid classifier proposed is proposed to be ViT + 
EfficientNet-B3, and it will have better outcomes in the 
detection of pancreatic lesions. ViT introduces powerful 
global attention models that detect long-range correlation, 
and structural patterns of the CT slices in general. This is 
supplemented by EfficientNet-B3 that provides efficient and 
highly detailed local feature extraction with its scale-based 
convolutional layers on a compound. These two typologies 
combined enable the classifier to consider both the large scale 
and small-scale spatial cues that introduce a more balanced 
and discriminative representation. The hyperparameters that 
carry the greatest significance in the classifier are further 
optimized by means of a two-fold metaheuristic method, 
which is the learning rate, the weight of the layers and the 
fusion coefficients. The Sparrow Search Algorithm (SSA) is 
a technique that directs the global initial search by simulating 
the foraging and anti-predation behavior of sparrows and 
allows promising parameter space to be quickly explored. 
These are then narrowed using Gray Wolf Optimization 
(GWO) which models hierarchical wolfs hunting strategies to 
guarantee 
the 
converging 
solution 
to 
the 
optimal 
configuration. 
The 
combination 
of 
the 
SSA-GWO 
hybridization provides that the fused ViT-EfficientNet-B3 
classifier is robust but well-tuned, having a higher accuracy 
and generalization under a variety of CT imaging settings. 
IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
In the section, the performance analysis of the suggested 
framework is provided based on thorough experiments done 
in Python and deep learning libraries. The implementation 
covers modules of preprocessing, segmentation, feature 
extraction, optimization, and hybrid classification, and 
therefore, it can assess the effectiveness of the system end-to-
end. The diagnostic ability of the model is analyzed by 
quantitative measures, including accuracy, sensitivity, 
specificity, precision, and F1-score, whereas comparative 
analysis of the model with the known baseline architectures 
illustrates the advances made by the combined approach to 
the domain. It indicates the trends in performance that became 
apparent, explains the benefits of each of the components, and 
shows how the given framework can be used to facilitate a 
strong and stable detection of pancreatic neoplasm. 
A. Experimental Findings 
The fig. 2 illustrates a well-organized collection of 
annotated CT scan images that were employed in the training 
and testing of various machine learning models for medical 
diagnostics. The upper part of the image is labeled with 
“Train Sample CT Images,” whereas the lower part contains 
“Test Sample CT Images”; both are further respectively 
subdivided into three groups according to the specific organs: 
liver, kidney, and pancreas. For each organ group, there are 
three grayscale cross-sectional CT slices which are 
respectively marked as “ANNOTATED IMAGE,” meaning 
that the areas of interest have been indicated by either manual 
or automated annotation methods. The training and testing 
sets are so uniformly formatted that organ representation is 
perfectly balanced, and annotation quality is very high, thus 
helping to facilitate very reliable supervised learning. The 
classification of this dataset in a very organized manner leads 
to model validation in a systematic way and, at the same time, 
increases the applicability of medical image analysis in 
different anatomical regions.  
 
 
Fig. 2. Annotated Training and Testing CT Images for Organ-Specific 
Model Development 
This illustration shows how the Contrast Limited 
Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) process has 
influenced an abdominal CT scan with a pancreatic tumor. 
The original grayscale image on the left is too dark and of low 
contrast, which complicates the interpretation of small 
anatomical structures. Conversely, the right image, processed 
by CLAHE, is significantly brighter and at a much higher 
contrast level, thus allowing to see more details in the 
abdominal area. This technique of improvement is highly 
helpful in medical imaging because it highlights the edges of 
the tissues, identifies the potential lesions, and increases the 
visibility of the crucial aspects in general. CLAHE, being a 
part of the preprocessing stage, not only helps in making the 
input data clearer but also in accurate segmentation, feature 
extraction, and tumor identification which are the 
downstream tasks that require accuracy.  
 
Fig. 3. CLAHE Enhancement Applied to Abdominal CT Image 
The figure shows, in a step-by-step manner, the 
application of image enhancement on a pelvic CT scan during 
three different stages. The first image from the left is the 
original grayscale scan, which is marked with low contrast 
and poor anatomical visibility. The central image marked 


“After CLAHE,” displays the outcome of Contrast Limited 
Adaptive Histogram Equalization, which enhances local 
contrast and reveals the more delicate structural details. The 
last image on the right, which is named “CLAHE + Gaussian 
(5×5),” is the final version of the enhanced scan after a 5×5 
Gaussian Blur has been applied, which reduces noise and 
gives a more visually appealing smoothness while keeping 
the important features. The process of improvement is 
depicted in this way how the combination of CLAHE with 
Gaussian filtering has made it possible to achieve a good 
point between contrast enhancement and noise suppression, 
consequently clearer and more diagnostically useful CT 
images. 
 
Fig. 4. Progressive Enhancement of Pelvic CT scan Using CLAHE and 
Gaussian Filtering 
The illustration presents the overall effect of the various 
enhancement techniques applied to a CT scan as part of the 
image preprocessing workflow. The leftmost image is the 
output 
after 
Contrast 
Limited 
Adaptive 
Histogram 
Equalization (CLAHE), where local contrast is boosts to a 
great extent, showing anatomical structures more clearly. The 
middle image takes Gaussian filtering on the CLAHE-
enhanced scan, making the image smoother and noise less 
prominent while still keeping the structure intact. The 
rightmost image uses a 3×3 median filter, noise remaining 
from the previous steps is greatly reduced and edges along 
with fine details are well accounted for. Sequentially, the 
three approaches—CLAHE, Gaussian blur, and median 
filtering—effectively support the notion that good diagnosis 
is achieved through the combination of contrast enhancement, 
noise reduction and the preservation of critical anatomical 
demarcation. 
 
Fig. 5. Sequential Enhancement of CT Image Using CLAHE, Gaussian 
Blur, and Median Filtering 
The normalization impacts the preprocessing CT image, 
and the figure illustrates this effect, indicating the necessity 
of normalization for medical images machine learning 
applications. The image on the left "Before normalization 
(uint8 0–255)” is showing the CT scan with pixel intensities 
in a standard 8-bit format. The use of this format can cause 
differences and, thus, to training models that are not 
consistent. The image on the right labeled "After 
normalization (float [0–1])" is of the same scan where the 
pixel intensities are scaled to a floating-point range of 0 to 1. 
This scaling brings about improved numerical stability, 
uniform data distribution, and faster model convergence in 
training. The anatomy is still the same in the normalized 
images, but the images now appear smoother and less 
contrasted, which suggests that the dynamic range and the 
intensity representation have also been improved and made 
standard. Consequently, this normalization step is critical for 
the next segmentation and classification tasks to be reliable 
and reproducible in terms of performance. 
 
Fig. 6. Normalization of CT scan from 8-bit Intensity Range to Float Scale 
This picture shows a side-by-side visualization of the 
medical imaging data before and after application of the 
MAGRes-UNet model for segmentation. There are two 
images in each row, the one on the left being the original 
grayscale CT scan, and the one on the right being the 
corresponding output of segmentation. The collection 
consists of two normal chest CT images and one abdominal 
CT image with a pancreatic tumor. The anatomical structures 
and potential pathological areas are marked in the segmented 
outputs with blue and yellow colors, making it easier to tell 
the tissue borders apart. The delimitated tumor in the 
abdominal scan proves the model’s competence in correctly 
locating the abnormal regions. All in all, this figure presents 
the advantages of MAGRes-UNet in making structures more 
visible, allowing better locating of lesions, and providing 
support for the interpretation of automated diagnostics. 
 
Fig. 7. Segmentation Outputs Generated by the MAGRes-UNet Model 
In Table 1, a detailed performance comparison of 
different deep learning models is presented, which includes 
five main evaluation metrics—accuracy, sensitivity, F1-


score, precision, and specificity—and it has the advantage of 
allowing an easy conclusion to be drawn as to their diagnostic 
power for the detection of pancreatic neoplasms. The values 
reveal quite mediocre results of the older models such as 
DenseNet-121, Xception and ResNet-50 and very low values 
of sensitivity and F1-score, which means that the models 
cannot detect the tumor regions very well and are therefore 
unreliable in some instances. EfficientNet-B3, on the other 
hand, shows a somewhat superior performance across the 
board; this can be attributed to the model's ability to extract 
features efficiently. The Vision Transformer (ViT) is another 
model that has gained attention for its high precision; 
however, with a slightly lower sensitivity it is suggested that 
the model relies heavily on global contextual cues. 
MobileNetV3-Large stands out with its remarkable accuracy; 
however, it is suffering from a weakness in specificity that 
results in a few normal cases being incorrectly classified as 
the tumor.

The Proposed Hybrid Model stands out among all 
baseline models and leads up to the winning architectures in 
terms of performance bringing nine-figure predictions of 
96.28% accuracy, 93.33% sensitivity, 95.58% F1-score, 
95.72% precision, and 94.83% specificity. The accuracy of 
tumor detection and reduction of false negatives and false 
positives are highlighted by such results. The performance 
indicated had its roots in the combination of transformer-
based global attention, efficient convolutional feature 
extraction and dual metaheuristic optimization. Thus, the 
table mattresses that the proposed framework is the most 
trustworthy and powerful diagnostic capability, amongst all 
other models evaluated. 
 
Fig. 8. Model Assessment 
The general results of the present research indicate that 
the suggested scalable architecture including the state-of-the-
art preprocessing, MAGRes-UNet segmentation, dense 
residual 
feature 
extraction, 
hybrid 
metaheuristic 
optimization, and fused ViT-EfficientNet-B3 classifier can 
substantially improve the early detection of neoplasms in the 
pancreas in CT. The model exhibits infallibility in all key 
performance indicators compared to traditional CNNs and 
newer transformer-based models, and this shows that it is 
well-equipped in detecting subtle lesion patterns and 
eliminating misclassification. Optimal feature selection and 
hybrid classification lead to the enhanced robustness, stability 
and diagnostic accuracy, which proves the potential of the 
framework as a useful clinical decision support tool in the 
diagnosis of early pancreatic cancer. 
V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
The research provides a detail and scalable deep learning 
model to enhance the process of early pancreatic neoplasm in 
multimodal CT images. The suggested framework combines 
the use of a powerful preprocessing pipeline, MAGRes-
UNet-based segmentation, and dense residual feature 
aggregation to increase the visibility of lesions and save 
subtle structural information. Moreover, the hybrid 
metaheuristic optimization, which involves the combination 
of HHO, BA to select features, and GWO to optimize 
hyperparameters, makes sure that the most discriminative 
features only are employed in the classification process, 
which greatly decreases the redundancy, and enhances the 
stability of a model. The combination of Vision Transformer 
(ViT) and the EfficientNet-B3 also enhances the overall 
performance of the model generalizing to a variety of imaging 
conditions successfully capturing global contextual trends 
and fine-grained local features.  
The proposed method is shown to be not only 
outperforming the existing CNN and transformer-based 
baselines in terms of accuracy, reaching a state of the art of 
96.23, but also significantly better in terms of sensitivity and 
specificity, as well as F1-score. This evidence portrays its 
applicability in a clinical setting. To support the early 
diagnosis of various clinical cases, future research will entail 
taking this framework to multi-phase dynamic CT, 3D 
volumetric segmentation, and cross-domain generalization. 
Combination with radiomics and clinical metadata can also 
be used to increase the reliability of predictions and clinical 
decision support.
