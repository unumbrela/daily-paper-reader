Abstract 

Argumentation frameworks ( AF s) have been extensively developed, but ex-isting higher-order bipolar AF s suffer from critical limitations: attackers and supporters are restricted to arguments, multi-valued and fuzzy semantics lack unified generalization, and encodings often rely on complex logics with poor interoperability. To address these gaps, this paper proposes a higher-order argumentation framework with supports ( HAF S ), which explicitly allows attacks and supports to act as both targets and sources of interactions. We define a suite of semantics for HAF S s, including extension-based semantics, adjacent complete labelling semantics (a 3-valued semantics), and numerical equational semantics ([0,1]-valued semantics). Furthermore, we develop a normal encoding methodology to translate HAF S s into propositional logic systems ( PLS s): HAF S s under complete labelling semantics are encoded into Łukasiewicz’s three-valued propositional logic ( PL L 

> 3

), and those under equational semantics are encoded into fuzzy PLS s ( PL [0 ,1] ) such as Gödel and Product fuzzy logics. We prove model equivalence between HAF S s and their encoded logical formulas, establishing the logical foundation of HAF S 

semantics. Additionally, we investigate the relationships between 3-valued complete semantics and fuzzy equational semantics, showing that models of fuzzy encoded semantics can be transformed into complete semantics models via ternarization, and vice versa for specific t-norms. This work advances the formalization and logical encoding of higher-order bipolar argumenta-tion, enabling seamless integration with lightweight computational solvers and uniform handling of uncertainty.

1. Introduction 

Since Dung’s argumentation frameworks ( DAF s) [1] were presented, ar-gumentation frameworks ( AF s) have been developed significantly. Syntacti-cally, higher-order AF s ( HOAF s) [2, 3, 4, 5], bipolar AF s [6, 7, 8], higher-order bipolar AF s [9, 10, 11, 12, 13], frameworks with sets of attacking ar-guments ( SET AF s) [14, 15], higher-order-set bipolar AF s [16, 17, 18] and higher-order set AF s [19] (which are not specific cases of the higher-order-set bipolar AF s introduced in [16, 17, 18]) have been proposed. Semantically, the labelling semantics [20] advances Dung’s extension semantics [1]. Numer-ical labelling semantics have been introduced from 3-valued semantics [21] to [0,1]-valued semantics, such as equational semantics [22, 23] and gradual semantics [2, 24, 25, 26, 27]. As a reasoning approach on conflict information, AF s are closely con-nected with logic systems. The research in [28] bridges DAF s and the 2-valued propositional logic system. An encoding method utilizing quantified Boolean formulas (QBF) is presented in [29, 30]. The study [29] extends 

DAF s into frameworks built upon a deductive system’s induced derivabil-ity relation, proposing a general encoding function for this relation; the en-coding technique from [28] is then shown to be a specific instance of this general scheme. Meanwhile, [30] devises a QBF-based encoding linked to a modified Kleene three-valued logic through the signed theory generated by a DAF . Connections between modal logics and DAF s are explored in [31, 32, 33, 34, 35]. Furthermore, relations between DAF s and intuitionistic logic systems are established in [36, 37]. Integration of DAF s with fuzzy set theory via extension-based methods is investigated in [38, 39, 40, 41, 42]. Alternatively, labelling-based approaches combined with iterative algorithms are employed to combine DAF s with fuzzy set theory in [43, 44]. Although [45] demonstrates a meta-logical equivalence between skeptical reasoning un-der argumentation semantics and Łukasiewicz’s three-valued logic ( PL L 

> 3

), it does not furnish an actual encoding from argumentation frameworks into 

PL L 

> 3

theories. A unified adaptive logic framework is introduced in [46], which 2encodes argumentation frameworks into logical premises and uses a dynamic proof system to model all standard semantics uniformly for both skeptical and credulous reasoning. The research in [47] links DAF s under complete semantics to three-valued propositional logics ( PL 3s) and connects DAF sunder equational semantics to fuzzy propositional logics ( PL [0 ,1] s) by en-coding DAF s into these logical systems. From the perspective of abstract dialectical frameworks ( ADF s) based on classical binary propositional logic (PL 2), the expressiveness of logical encodings for SET AF s is examined in [48]. Several works address logical encodings involving first-order logic for higher-order and bipolar AF s [49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55]. The method pro-posed in [47] is extended to higher-hierarchy AF s in [19]. Nevertheless, current studies concerning the logical encoding of argu-mentation frameworks continue to encounter notable deficiencies and ob-stacles that impede both their practical utility and theoretical coherence. Firstly, the predominant encoding techniques for Argumentation Frameworks (AF s) featuring higher-order constructs or collective attackers are predom-inantly grounded in first-order logic, modal logic, or second-order proposi-tional logic ( PL 2). Such techniques frequently incur substantial syntactic overhead—exemplified by quantifiers and intricate predicates in first-order logic—which hinders seamless interoperability with lightweight computa-tional solvers. Alternatively, they exhibit inherent limitations in representing uncertainty and graded truth values; for instance, PL 2 lacks direct mecha-nisms for capturing fuzzy degrees of acceptability. Secondly, although prior works have introduced structural formulations for higher-order bipolar AF s, a pivotal shortcoming persists: the constituents eligible to act as attackers or supporters are confined solely to arguments. From a standpoint of theoretical uniformity and real-world applicability, attacks and supports are themselves entities susceptible to being targeted and reinforced, much like arguments. Consequently, they should possess the analogous capacity to originate attacks and supports. Existing formalisms are thus incapable of modeling situations in which attacks and supports themselves constitute attackers or supporters, thereby limiting their applicability to a broad spectrum of intricate dialec-tical exchanges. Thirdly, extant research offers underdeveloped pathways for generalizing between multi-valued and fuzzy semantics. Many encodings terminate at three-valued semantics without progressing to continuous fuzzy interpretations, or necessitate substantial structural alterations when shift-ing across semantic paradigms, thereby precluding a smooth and uniform extension. In light of these constraints, the present paper is motivated by 3three principal objectives, seeking to bridge the identified theoretical voids and meet practical necessities: 

• To advance the HOAF N into a higher-order argumentation framework with supporters (HAF S ), thereby remedying a key limitation of exist-ing higher-order bipolar structures: the constraint that attackers and supporters must be arguments, to the exclusion of attacks and sup-ports. The proposed HAF S explicitly permits attacks and supports to serve as both targets and sources of attack and support. 

• To introduce a coherent and expressive semantic suite for HAF S s, encompassing extension-based semantics, complete labelling semantics, and numerical equational semantics. Whereas existing semantics for higher-order bipolar AF s are largely confined to discrete labels (e.g., 

in , out , undecided ), the semantics proposed herein establish a unified underpinning that naturally integrates discrete three-valued reasoning with continuous fuzzy reasoning. 

• To devise a tailored encoding methodology and a formal equational framework for HAF S s, creating a bridge to propositional logic systems (PLS s). This study advances the encoding methodology from AF s with only at-tacks [47, 19] to higher-order argumentation frameworks with supporters (HAF S s). It establishes the logical foundations for HAF S s by proving the model equivalence between an HAF S and its encoded logical formula, and introduces a formal equational approach. In summary, the core contributions of this paper are threefold: 

• Syntactic advancement : We propose the HAF S as a syntactic ex-tension of the HOAF N , which enables mutual interactions among at-tacks and supports (both being targeted and targeting others). 

• Semantic expansion : We define extension-based semantics and com-plete labelling semantics for HAF S s, and further design a numerical equational semantics for such frameworks. 

• Encoding development : We provide translations from HAF S s un-der complete semantics into PL L 

> 3

, and from HAF S s under equational semantics into PL [0 ,1] systems, while also exploring the relationship 4between general real-valued equational semantics and continuous fuzzy normal encoded equational semantics. 

2. Preliminaries 

2.1. The syntax and semantics of HOAF N s

Definition 1 (Higher-Order AF with Necessities ( HOAF N )) . [12] A higher-order argumentation framework with necessities ( HOAF N ) is a tuple ⟨A , R,

T⟩, where A is a finite set of arguments, R is a finite set of attacks, T is a finite set of (necessary) supports, and R ∪ T ⊆ A × (A ∪ R ∪ T).

Definition 2 (ASAF defeats) . [12] Let ⟨A , R, T⟩ be an ASAF , ϑ ∈ (A ∪ 

R ∪ T), α ∈ R, and S ⊆ (A ∪ R ∪ T). We say that α defeats ϑ given S

(denoted as α def S ϑ) if either: 

1. t(α) = ϑ,

2. ϑ ∈ R and t(α) = s(ϑ),

3. there exists b ∈ A such that t(α) = b and (b, ϑ ) ∈ (T ∩ S)+, or 

4. ϑ ∈ R and there exists b ∈ A such that t(α) = b and (b, s (ϑ)) ∈ (T∩S)+.

Definition 3 (ASAF defeated and acceptable sets) . [12] Let ⟨A , R, T⟩ be an ASAF and S ⊆ (A ∪ R ∪ T). We define: 

• def (S) = {ϑ ∈ (A ∪ R ∪ T) | ∃ α ∈ (R ∩ S) : α def S ϑ}.

• acc (S) = {ϑ ∈ (A ∪ R ∪ T) | ∀ α ∈ R : α def S ϑ =⇒ α ∈ def (S)}.

Definition 4 (RAF N defeats) . [12] Let ⟨A , R, T⟩ be a RAF N , ϑ ∈ (A ∪ 

R ∪ T), a ∈ A , and S ⊆ (A ∪ R ∪ T). We say that argument a defeats ϑ given 

S (denoted as a def S ϑ) if either: 

1. (a, ϑ ) ∈ (R ∩ S), or 

2. there exists b ∈ A such that (a, b ) ∈ (R ∩ S) and (b, ϑ ) ∈ (T ∩ S)+.

Definition 5 (RAF N defeated and acceptable sets) . [12] Let ⟨A , R, T⟩ be a 

RAF N and S ⊆ (A ∪ R ∪ T). We define: 

• def (S) = {ϑ ∈ (A ∪ R ∪ T) | ∃ b ∈ A ∩ S : b def S ϑ};

• acc (S) = {ϑ ∈ (A ∪ R ∪ T) | ∀ b ∈ A : b def S ϑ =⇒ b ∈ def (S)}.

5From the above definitions and logical considerations, if ∄b ∈ A s.t. b def S

ϑ then ϑ ∈ acc (S).

Definition 6 (HOAF N semantic notions and extensions) . [12] Let ∆ = 

⟨A , R, T⟩ be a HOAF N and S ⊆ (A ∪ R ∪ T). We say that S is: 

• conflict-free iff S ∩ def (S) = ∅;

• admissible iff it is conflict-free and S ⊆ acc (S);

• a complete extension of ∆ iff it is conflict-free and S = acc (S);

• a preferred extension of ∆ iff it is a maximal (w.r.t. ⊆) complete extension; 

• a stable extension of ∆ iff it is a preferred extension such that S ∪

def (S) = ( A ∪ R ∪ T);

• the grounded extension of ∆ iff it is the smallest (w.r.t. ⊆) complete extension. 

Definition 7 (extension-based labellings) . [12] Let ∆ = ⟨A , R, T⟩ be an 

HOAF N and E an σ-extension of ∆, with σ ∈ { co, gr, st, pr }. A labeling of 

∆ under semantics σ is a function LE : ( A ∪ R ∪ T) → { in , out , undec } such that for any ϑ ∈ (A ∪ R ∪ T) it holds that: 

1. LE (ϑ) = in iff ϑ ∈ acc (E),

2. LE (ϑ) = out iff ϑ ∈ def (E), and 

3. LE (ϑ) = undec iff ϑ ∈ (A ∪ R ∪ T) \ (acc (E) ∪ def (E)) .2.2. Propositional logic systems 

Some essential knowledge of propositional logic systems is given in [47, 19]. For in-depth knowledge of PLS s, interested readers may consult [56, 57, 58, 59, 60]. In this subsection, we only present some foundational operations. For the meta-language of this paper, we denote “ A if and only if B” by “A ⇐⇒ B” and “if B then A” by “ B =⇒ A”, where A and B are sentences. A (formal) language L of a PLS is determined by the following compo-nents: 1. Alphabet: The alphabet of L consists of: 

• A countable set Prop = {p1, p 2, p 3, . . . } of propositional variables .6• The set of logical connectives : {¬ , ∧, ∨, →, ↔} .

– ¬ is a unary connective (negation). 

– ∧, ∨, →, ↔ are binary connectives (conjunction, disjunction, implication, equivalence). 

• The auxiliary symbols: parentheses “(” and “)”. 2. Syntax (Formation Rules): The set Form (L) of well-formed formu-las (wffs) is the smallest set such that: 

• If p ∈ Prop, then p ∈ Form (L).

• If φ ∈ Form (L), then (¬φ) ∈ Form (L).

• If φ, ψ ∈ Form (L) and ◦ ∈ {∧ , ∨, →, ↔} , then (φ ◦ ψ) ∈ Form (L).3. Additional Conventions: 

• Outer parentheses are often omitted. 

• The precedence order of connectives (from highest to lowest) is: 

¬, ∧, ∨, →, ↔.

• The symbols ⊤ (tautology) and ⊥ (contradiction) may be added as atomic formulas, or defined as p ∨ ¬ p and p ∧ ¬ p, respectively. In this paper, we only consider any PLS that has numerical assign-ment domains (subsets of [0 , 1] ) and their corresponding numerical semantic systems, i.e., the semantics of a PLS is decided by the interpreted truth-functions (operators) of the connectives in the PLS . We use ∥ · ∥ to rep-resent an assignment or a model over the Prop or the evaluation of all for-mulas. In each PLS and any ∥ · ∥ , we always have that ∥⊥∥ = 0 and 

a ↔ b := ( a → b) ∧ (b → a) for any formulas a and b.In the PL L 

> 3

[61], the connectives ¬, ∧ and ∨ are interpreted as: 

• ∥¬ a∥ = 1 − ∥ a∥

• ∥a ∧ b∥ = min {∥ a∥, ∥b∥} 

• ∥a ∨ b∥ = max {∥ a∥, ∥b∥} 

where a, b are propositional formulas. The connective → is interpreted by the operator ⇒ such that ∥a → b∥ = ∥a∥ ⇒ ∥ b∥, where the truth-degree table for ⇒ is given in Table 1. 7⇒ 0 12 10 1 1 1 

> 1212

1 11 0 12 1    

> Table 1: Truth-degree table of ⇒in PL L
> 3.

Because a ↔ b := ( a → b) ∧ (b → a), we obtain 

∥a ↔ b∥ = min {∥ a → b∥, ∥b → a∥} = min {∥ a∥ ⇒ ∥ b∥, ∥b∥ ⇒ ∥ a∥} .

Hence ↔ is interpreted by the operator ⇔, where the truth-degree table for 

⇔ is shown in Table 2. 

⇔ 0 12 10 1 12 0 

> 1212

1 12

1 0 12 1    

> Table 2: Truth-degree table of ⇔in PL L
> 3.

Next, we review some important fuzzy operators in PL [0 ,1] s [56, 57, 58]. The connectives ¬, ∧, → are interpreted as a negation, a t-norm, and an implication, respectively. A negation N is called a standard negation if ∀m ∈

[0 , 1] : N (m) = 1 − m. The following are key continuous t-norms and their corresponding R-implications ( m, n ∈ [0 , 1] ): 

• Gödel t-norm: TG(m, n ) = min {m, n };

• R-implication of TG: IG(m, n ) = 

(

1 m ≤ nn m > n ;

• Łukasiewicz t-norm: TL(m, n ) = max {0, m + n − 1};

• R-implication of TL: IL(m, n ) = min {1 − m + n, 1};

• Product t-norm: TP (m, n ) = m · n;

• R-implication of TP : IP (m, n ) = 

(

1 m ≤ n 

> nm

m > n .8Note that for any R-implication I, we have that I(m, n ) = I(n, m ) = 1 iff 

m = n, where m, n ∈ [0 , 1] . Therefore, ∥a ↔ b∥ = 1 iff ∥a ← b∥ = ∥a →

b∥ = 1 iff ∥a∥ = ∥b∥, where a and b are propositional formulas. In this paper, we use PL G 

> [0 ,1]

[62] to denote the PLS equipped with the standard negation, Gödel t-norm TG and R-implication IG. Similarly, PL P

> [0 ,1]

[62] denotes the PLS equipped with the standard negation, Product t-norm 

TP and R-implication IP , while PL L 

> [0 ,1]

[62] denotes the PLS equipped with the standard negation, Łukasiewicz t-norm TL and R-implication IL.

3. Motivations 

In the Preliminary Section, we have presented the general motivations. In this section, we will elaborate on the motivations of this paper. We first analyze the syntactic limitations of current higher-order bipo-lar AF s. While RAF N s were introduced in [16, 17], REBAF s in [18], and 

ASAF s in [10] (later developed in [11] and summarized in [12]), all three frameworks share a common restriction: they do not permit attacks or sup-ports themselves to be targeted by other relations. However, since attacks or supports can be targeted, attacks or supports should also have the ability to target others. Moreover, in practical argumentation scenarios, situations exist where attacks or supports do serve as targets. Thus, we propose the novel HAF S whose syntax explicitly accommodates this case. Then we analyze the semantic perspective. In [12], the authors simplify the syntax of RAF N s [16, 17] as the same syntax of ASAF s and name the two higher-order bipolar AF s as HOAF N s. When RAF N s [12] and 

ASAF s are restricted as AF s that have only support relations, they have the same semantics. The difference between both frameworks results from the semantics on attack relations. For the ASAF , the most serious semantic shortcoming is that the value of an attack depends on the value of its source. If the value of an attack’s source is 0, then the value of the attack must be 0. However, on one hand, since attacks represent logical attack-relationships between arguments (or attacks or supports), the truth of a logical attack-relationship will not depend on the truth of its source—just like in classical propositional logic, the validity of an implication proposition does not depend on the validity of its antecedent. On the other hand, we encounter many situations where the source of an attack is invalid, yet the attack itself is valid. Thus, the value of an attack should not depend on the value of its source. This semantic independence-feature is characterized by the RAF N s9[12]. In fact, when we restrict a RAF N [12] as an AF only with the attack relation, we obtain an HLAF [3] and its associated semantics. Therefore, in this paper we tend to choose the semantics of RAF N s [12] to generalize it as the semantics of HAF S s. Another motivation stems from the treatment of support cycles in higher-order bipolar AF s. In [12], the authors avoid discussing the HOAF N s with support cycles. While the authors in [13] introduce a semantics for higher-order bipolar AF s that admits support cycles, their approach deems an ar-gument (or an attack or a support) unacceptable whenever it participates in a valid support cycle. In our view, extensions that include such an element should remain possible, as it may well be justified. Therefore, we aim to develop a novel semantics for higher-order bipolar AF s with support cycles, aligning with this perspective. Numerical [0 , 1] -valued semantics for higher-order or set AF s are devel-oped in [27, 63, 64, 19], but the numerical semantics for higher-order bipolar 

AF s are absent. Thus, this absence motivates us to develop the numerical semantics for HAF S s. We promote the encoding approach to develop the semantics of HAF S s, since this approach connects AF s and logic systems, which provides logical foundations for argumentation semantics and avoid arbitrary diverse semantic definitions. 

4. The syntax and basic semantics of HAF S s

In this section, we present the syntax and basic semantics of HAF S s. First, we formalize the syntax of HAF S s. We then introduce the adja-cent complete labelling semantics — the truth degree of each argument (or attack or support) is decided only by the truth degrees of its adjacent ele-ments — as a foundational and concise semantics for HAF S s. To situate 

HAF S s within traditional argumentation semantic paradigms, we further develop its extension-based semantics and define the extension-derived com-plete labelling. Then, we explore the inherent relationships between adjacent complete labellings and extension-derived complete labellings. 

4.1. Syntax of HAF S s

Definition 8. A higher-order AF with supports ( HAF S ) is a tuple (A, R, T, U ), where U = A ∪ R ∪ T , A is a finite set of arguments, R ⊆ U × U is a finite set of attacks, and T ⊆ U × U is a finite set of necessary supports. If 

10 (a, b ) ∈ R, then we denote (a, b ) by rba. If (c, d ) ∈ T , then we denote (c, d ) by 

tdc .

We say that b attacks a (or that b is an attacker of a) iff (b, a ) ∈ R, and we denote (b, a ) as rab . We call that c necessarily supports a (or that c is a necessary supporter of a) iff (c, a ) ∈ T , and we denote (c, a ) as tac .

4.2. Adjacent complete labelling semantics 

We first introduce the adjacent complete labelling of an HAF S .

Definition 9. For an HAF S = ( A, R, T, U ) and ∀a ∈ U , an adjacent com-plete labelling of the HAF S is a total function ∥ · ∥ : U → { 0, 1, 12 } such that 

• ∥a∥ = 1 iff [ ∀(b, a ) ∈ R : ∥b∥ = 0 or ∥rab ∥ = 0 ] and [ ∀(c, a ) ∈ T : ∥c∥ =1 or ∥tac ∥ = 0 ]; 

• ∥a∥ = 0 iff [ ∃(b, a ) ∈ R : ∥b∥ = 1 and ∥rab ∥ = 1 ] or [ ∃(c, a ) ∈ T : ∥c∥ =0 and ∥tac ∥ = 1 ]; 

• ∥a∥ = 12 iff otherwise. 

Note that if ∄b(( b, a ) ∈ R) and ∄c(( c, a ) ∈ T ) then the requirement for 

∥a∥ = 1 holds according to classical logic knowledge. We call the semantics “adjacent complete labelling semantics”, since the value of an element in 

U is decided only by its direct sources. Let us analyze the semantic feature characterized by this definition. For an element a ∈ U , if a is validly attacked, i.e., it has a valid attacker and its associated valid attack, then a is invalid; if a

is invalidly supported, i.e., it has an invalid supporter and its associated valid support, then a is invalid; if a is invalidly attacked and validly supported, then a is valid; a is undecided otherwise. Next, we give the definition of the core and definitions of the grounded labelling, the preferred labelling and the stable labelling. 

Definition 10. For a labelling L of an HAF S = ( A, R, T, U ), the core of 

L, denoted by Core (L), is defined as the set {x ∈ U | L(x) = 1 }.

Definition 11. A labelling of an HAF S = ( A, R, T, U ) is called 

• the adjacent grounded labelling iff it is the adjacent complete labelling with the smallest (w.r.t. ⊆) core; 

11 • an adjacent preferred labelling iff it is an adjacent complete labelling with a maximal (w.r.t. ⊆) core; 

• an adjacent stable labelling Ls iff Ls is an adjacent preferred labelling such that ∀y ∈ (U \ Core (Ls)) , Ls(y) = 0 .4.3. Extension-based semantics for HAF S s

We give the definitions of adjacent labelling semantics directly in Subsec-tion 4.2. However, we want to establish traditional extension-based semantics for HAF S s and explore relationships with the adjacent complete labelling semantics. 

4.3.1. The extension-based semantic approach for HAF S s

First, we present definitions related to support chains. 

Definition 12. Let (A, R, T, U ) be an HAF S . A support chain of the 

HAF S is a finite set {(f1, f 2), (f2, f 3), . . . , (fn−1, f n)} ⊆ T . An acyclic sup-port chain of the HAF S is a support chain {(f1, f 2), (f2, f 3), . . . , (fn−1, f n)}

such that any two elements in {f1, f 2, . . . , f n} are distinct. The HAF S is 

support-acyclic iff each support chain of the HAF S is an acyclic support chain. 

Then, we introduce definitions related to defeats. 

Definition 13. Let HAF S = ( A, R, T, U ), B ⊆ U , a ∈ U and b ∈ U .We say that b directly defeats a w.r.t. B, denoted as b a-d a w.r.t. B, iff 

b ∈ B and (b, a ) ∈ R ∩ B. We say that b indirectly defeats a w.r.t. B via 

G, denoted as b s-d a w.r.t. B via G, iff there exists an acyclic support chain G = {(gn, g n−1), (gn−1, g n−2), . . . , (g2, g 1), (g1, a )} (n ⩾ 1) such that 

G ⊆ T ∩ B, (b, g n) ∈ R ∩ B and b ∈ B. We say that b defeats a w.r.t. B iff 

b a-d a w.r.t. B or b s-d a w.r.t. B. We say that B defeats a iff ∃b ∈ B

such that b defeats a w.r.t. B. Let dft (B) denote the set {a | B defeats a}.

Note that the acyclic support chain is used for defining defeats but we do not require that the HAF S in Definition 13 is support-acyclic. 

Lemma 1. Let HAF S = ( A, R, T, U ), B ⊆ U , a ∈ U and b ∈ U . b s-d a

w.r.t. B via G = {(gn, g n−1), (gn−1, g n−2), . . . , (g2, g 1), (g1, a )} (n ⩾ 1) iff b

defeats g1 w.r.t. B and {(g1, a )} ⊆ T ∩ B.Proof. We first discuss two cases according to n.12 • Case 1, n = 1 .

b s-d a w.r.t. B via G = {(g1, a )}⇐⇒ b a-d g1 w.r.t. B and {(g1, a )} ⊆ T ∩ B.

• Case 2, n ⩾ 2.

b s-d a w.r.t. B via G = {(gn, g n−1), (gn−1, g n−2), . . . , (g2, g 1), (g1, a )}⇐⇒ there exists an acyclic support chain 

G = {(gn, g n−1), (gn−1, g n−2), . . . , (g2, g 1), (g1, a )}

(n ⩾ 1) such that G ⊆ T ∩ B, (b, g n) ∈ R ∩ B and b ∈ B

⇐⇒ there exists an acyclic support chain 

G′ = {(gn, g n−1), (gn−1, g n−2), . . . , (g2, g 1)}

(n ⩾ 1) such that G′ ⊆ T ∩ B, (b, g n) ∈ R ∩ B, b ∈ B and {(g1, a )} ⊆ 

T ∩ B

⇐⇒ b s-d g1 w.r.t. B via G′ = {(gn, g n−1), (gn−1, g n−2), . . . , (g2, g 1)}

and {(g1, a )} ⊆ T ∩ B.Then, by combining the above two cases, we have that: 

b s-d a w.r.t. B via G = {(gn, g n−1), (gn−1, g n−2), . . . , (g2, g 1), (g1, a )} (n ⩾ 1) 

⇐⇒ (1) (in the case of n = 1 ) b a-d g1 w.r.t. B and {(g1, a )} ⊆ T ∩B or (2) (in the case of n ⩾ 2) b s-d g1 w.r.t. B via G′ = {(gn, g n−1), (gn−1, g n−2), . . . , (g2,g1)} and {(g1, a )} ⊆ T ∩ B

⇐⇒ b defeats g1 and {(g1, a )} ⊆ T ∩ B.Then we introduce the definition of defence. 

Definition 14. Let HAF S = ( A, R, T, U ), B ⊆ U and a ∈ U . We say that 

B defends a iff each following item holds: 

• ∀b(( b, a ) ∈ R): B defeats b or B defeats (b, a );

• ∀c(( c, a ) ∈ T ): c ∈ B or B defeats (c, a ).Let dfd (B) denote the set {a | B defends a}.

Note that if ∄b(( b, a ) ∈ R) and ∄c(( c, a ) ∈ T ) then the above two items hold according to classical logic knowledge. Then we give the definition of related semantics based on defeats and defences. 13 Definition 15. Let (A, R, T, U ) be an HAF S , E ⊆ U and ∀a ∈ U . We define that E is: 

• a conflict-free set iff ∄a ∈ E such that E defeats a;

• an admissible set iff it is a conflict-free set and E ⊆ dfd (E) (i.e. 

∀a ∈ E: E defends a); 

• a complete extension iff it is a conflict-free set and E = dfd (E);

• the grounded extension iff it is the smallest (w.r.t. ⊆) complete exten-sion; 

• a preferred extension iff it is a maximal (w.r.t. ⊆) complete extension; 

• a stable extension iff it is a preferred extension such that E ∪ dft (E) = 

U .

Next, we give the definition of extension-derived complete labellings. 

Definition 16. For an HAF S = ( A, R, T, U ), any complete extension E

of the HAF S and ∀a ∈ U , an extension-derived complete labelling of the 

HAF S w.r.t. E is a function LE : U → { 0, 1, 12 } such that 

LE (a) = 



1 iff a ∈ E;0 iff a ∈ dft (E);  

> 12

otherwise. 

Note that the complete extension E is conflict-free. Thus, if LE (a) = 1 

(i.e., a ∈ E) then LE (a)̸ = 0 (i.e. a / ∈ dft (E)) and LE (a)̸ = 12 (because of “otherwise"). If LE (a) = 0 (i.e. a ∈ dft (E)) then LE (a)̸ = 1 (i.e. a / ∈ E)and LE (a)̸ = 12 (because of “otherwise"). If LE (a) = 12 then LE (a)̸ = 1 

and LE (a)̸ = 0 (because of “otherwise"). Therefore, an extension-derived complete labelling is a well-defined total function. 

4.3.2. Relationships between an extension-derived complete labelling and an adjacent complete labelling 

We present the relationship between an extension-derived complete la-belling and an adjacent complete labelling of an HAF S .14 Theorem 1. For an HAF S = ( A, R, T, U ), if a labelling is an extension-derived complete labelling of the HAF S then it is an adjacent complete la-belling of the HAF S .Proof. Let LE be an extension-derived complete labelling of the HAF S w.r.t. complete extension E. We need to discuss three cases for any a ∈ U .

• Case 1, LE (a) = 0 .

LE (a) = 0 

⇐⇒ a ∈ dft (E)

⇐⇒ ∃ e ∈ E such that e defeats a w.r.t. E

⇐⇒ ∃ b ∈ E such that b a-d a w.r.t. E or ∃c ∈ E such that c s-d a

w.r.t. E via G = {(gn, g n−1), (gn−1, g n−2), . . . , (g2, g 1), (g1, a )}⇐⇒ ∃ b ∈ E such that (b, a ) ∈ R ∩ E or by Lemma 1, ∃c ∈ E such that 

c defeats g1 w.r.t. E and {(g1, a )} ⊆ T ∩ E

⇐⇒ by the definition of the extension-derived complete labelling, we have [ ∃(b, a ) ∈ R : LE (b) = 1 and LE (rab ) = 1 ] or [ ∃(g1, a ) ∈ T :

LE (g1) = 0 and LE (tag1 ) = 1 ]. 

• Case 2, LE (a) = 1 .

LE (a) = 1 

⇐⇒ a ∈ E, i.e., a ∈ dfd (E)

⇐⇒ each following item holds: 

– ∀b(( b, a ) ∈ R): B defeats b or B defeats (b, a )

– ∀c(( c, a ) ∈ T ): c ∈ B or B defeats (c, a )

⇐⇒ by the definition of the extension-derived complete labelling, we have [ ∀(b, a ) ∈ R : LE (b) = 0 or LE (rab ) = 0 ] and [ ∀(c, a ) ∈ T : LE (c) = 1 or LE (tac ) = 0 ]. 

• Case 3, LE (a) = 12 .

LE (a) = 12

⇐⇒ LE (a)̸ = 0 and LE (a)̸ = 1 

⇐⇒ from Case 1 and Case 2, it is not any case in the following items: 

– in Case 1, [ ∃(b, a ) ∈ R : LE (b) = 1 and LE (rab ) = 1 ] or [ ∃(g1, a ) ∈

T : LE (g1) = 0 and LE (tag1 ) = 1 ]

– in Case 2 [ ∀(b, a ) ∈ R : LE (b) = 0 or LE (rab ) = 0 ] and [ ∀(c, a ) ∈

T : LE (c) = 1 or LE (tac ) = 0 ]15 From the three cases and Definition 9, an extension-derived complete la-belling LE is an adjacent complete labelling. 

Remark 1. For an HAF S = ( A, R, T, U ), an adjacent complete labelling of the HAF S may not be an extension-derived complete labelling of the 

HAF S .We use Example 1 to explain Remark 1. 

Example 1. Let HAF S = ( A, R, T, U ), A = {a}, R = ∅, T = {(a, a )} and 

U = {a, (a, a )}. The extension-derived complete labelling LE of the HAF S 

is that LE (a) = 1 , and LE (( a, a )) = 1 . However, three adjacent complete labellings of the HAF S , denoted ∥ · ∥ , ∥ · ∥ ′, and ∥ · ∥ ′′ , are as follows: 

[∥a∥ = 1 and ∥(a, a )∥ = 1] , [∥a∥′ = 0 and ∥(a, a )∥′ = 1] , and [∥a∥′′ = 12 and 

∥(a, a )∥′′ = 1] .

In fact, for some special cases, an adjacent complete labelling of an HAF S 

is an extension-derived complete labelling of the HAF S .

Theorem 2. For a support-acyclic HAF S = ( A, R, T, U ), an adjacent com-plete labelling of the HAF S is an extension-derived complete labelling of the 

HAF S .Proof. Let ∥·∥ be an adjacent complete labelling and E = {a ∈ U | ∥ a∥ = 1 }.We need to discuss three cases. First, we prove that ∀d ∈ U : ∥d∥ = 0 iff E defeats d. From Definition 9, 

∀u ∈ U , we have: 

∥u∥ = 0 ⇐⇒ [∃ruv ∈ E and v ∈ E] or [∃tuw ∈ E and ∥w∥ = 0] (1) Then, for any a ∈ U , we have the chain of equivalences below: 

∥a∥ = 0 

⇐⇒ [∃rab ∈ E and b ∈ E] or [ ∃tac ∈ E and ∥c∥ = 0 ] by Equation 1 

⇐⇒ (Level 1) [ ∃b: b a-d a (w.r.t. E)] or [ ∃tac ∈ E and ∥c∥ = 0 ]

⇐⇒ [∃b: b a-d a] or [ ∃tac ∈ E and [[ ∃rcd ∈ E and d ∈ E] or [ ∃tce ∈ E and 

∥e∥ = 0 ]]] by Equation 1 

⇐⇒ [∃b: b a-d a] or [ ∃tac ∈ E and ∃rcd ∈ E and d ∈ E] or [ ∃tac ∈ E and 

∃tce ∈ E and ∥e∥ = 0 ]

⇐⇒ (Level 2) [ ∃b: b a-d a] or [ ∃d: d s-d a (w.r.t. E via {tac })] or [ ∃tac ∈ E

and ∃tce ∈ E and ∥e∥ = 0 ]16 ⇐⇒ [∃b: b a-d a] or [ ∃d: d s-d a] or [ ∃tac ∈ E and ∃tce ∈ E and [[ ∃ref ∈ E

and f ∈ E] or [ ∃teg ∈ E and ∥g∥ = 0 ]]] by Equation 1 

⇐⇒ [∃b: b a-d a] or [ ∃d: d s-d a] or [ ∃tac ∈ E and ∃tce ∈ E and ∃ref ∈ E and 

f ∈ E] or [ ∃tac ∈ E and ∃tce ∈ E and ∃teg ∈ E and ∥g∥ = 0 ]

⇐⇒ (Level 3) [ ∃b: b a-d a] or [ ∃d: d s-d a] or [ ∃f : f s-d a (w.r.t. E via 

{tac , t ce})] or [ ∃tac ∈ E and ∃tce ∈ E and ∃teg ∈ E and ∥g∥ = 0 ]Since the HAF S is support-acyclic and U is finite, this chain of equiv-alences must stop at a finite level and we suppose that it stops at Level n. Thus, we have: 

∥a∥ = 0 

⇐⇒ (Level n) [ ∃b: b a-d a] or [ ∃d: d s-d a] or [ ∃f : f s-d a] or . . . or [ ∃tac ∈ E

and ∃tce ∈ E and ∃teg ∈ E and . . . and ∃tjk ∈ E and ∥k∥ = 0 ]

⇐⇒ [∃b: b a-d a] or [ ∃d: d s-d a] or [ ∃f : f s-d a] or . . . or [ ∃tac ∈ E and 

∃tce ∈ E and ∃teg ∈ E and . . . and ∃tjk ∈ E and ∃rkm ∈ E and m ∈ E] by Equation 1 and the final Level n 

⇐⇒ [∃b: b a-d a] or [ ∃d: d s-d a] or [ ∃f : f s-d a] or . . . or [ ∃m: m s-d a]

⇐⇒ E defeats a.Second, we prove that E is a complete extension. 

∥a∥ = 1 (i.e., a ∈ E)

⇐⇒ [∀(b, a ) ∈ R : ∥b∥ = 0 or ∥rab ∥ = 0 ] and [ ∀(c, a ) ∈ T : ∥c∥ = 1 or 

∥tac ∥ = 0 ] by Definition 9 

⇐⇒ [∀(b, a ) ∈ R : E defeats b or E defeats rab ] and [ ∀(c, a ) ∈ T : c ∈ E or E

defeats tac ]

⇐⇒ a ∈ dfd (E).Thus, we obtain that E = dfd (E). We also need to prove that E is conflict-free. 

• a ∈ E(∥a∥ = 1) =⇒ ∀ (b, a ) ∈ R : ∥b∥ = 0 or ∥rab ∥ = 0 =⇒ ∄(b, a ) ∈ R : ∥b∥ = 1 and ∥rab ∥ = 1 

⇐⇒ ∄b : b a-d a w.r.t. E.

• a ∈ E(∥a∥ = 1) =⇒ ∀ (c, a ) ∈ T : ∥c∥ = 1 or ∥tac ∥ = 0 =⇒ ∄(c, a ) ∈ T : ∥c∥ = 0 and ∥tac ∥ = 1 

⇐⇒ ∄(c, a ) ∈ T : [∃e : e defeats c w.r.t. E] and [ tac ∈ E]

⇐⇒ ∄(c, a ) ∈ T : [∃e : e s-d a w.r.t. E via {. . . , (c, a )}] by Lemma 1 

⇐⇒ ∄g : g s-d a w.r.t. E

17 From above two items, we have that ∀a ∈ E: E does not defeat a, i.e., E is conflict-free. Thus we have proven that E is a complete extension. Third, we analyse the case of ∥a∥ = 12 .

∥a∥ = 12

⇐⇒ ∥ a∦ = 1 and ∥a∦ = 0 

⇐⇒ a / ∈ E and E does not defeat a.From the three cases, an adjacent complete labelling ∥ · ∥ of a support-acyclic HAF S satisfies the definition of an extension-derived complete la-belling of the HAF S .A BHAF [2, 19] is a particular HAF S whose support relation is the empty set. Thus, we have established the extension-based semantics for 

BHAF s by applying the extension-based semantics for HAF S s to BHAF s. And an adjacent complete labelling of a BHAF is equivalent to an extension-derived complete labelling of the BHAF by Theorem 1 and Theorem 2. 

5. Encoding HAF S s to PLS s

This section is dedicated to encoding HAF S s to PLS s, which serves to link HAF S s with PLS s and dissect their semantic correlations. We first present a general encoding approach for HAF S s. Subsequently, we elaborate on specific encoding strategies: we map HAF S s to PL L 

> 3

, encode 

HAF S s to PL [0 ,1] (with a focus on the fuzzy normal encoded semantics), and further realize the encoding of HAF S s to three important instances of PL [0 ,1] . Finally, we investigate the relationships between the adjacent complete labelling semantics of HAF S s and the fuzzy normal encoded se-mantics, which are analyzed in three scenarios: zero-divisor free t-norms,  

> 12

-idempotent t-norms, and zero-divisor free 12 -idempotent t-norms. 

5.1. The encoding approach for HAF S s

In this subsection, we present related definitions of the encoding method-ology and the translating methodology for HAF S s. Similar approaches are introduced in [47, 19] . Let HAFS be the set of all HAF S s. Let the arguments, attacks and sup-ports of HAFS be in one-to-one correspondence with propositional variables in a PLS . Let FPL be the set of all formulas in the PLS .

Definition 17. An encoding of HAFS is a function ec : HAFS → F PL ,s.t. the set of all propositional variables in the formula ec (HAF S ) is the set 

18 of all arguments, attacks and supports in the HAF S . We call ec (HAF S ) the 

encoded formula of the HAF S .

Encoding HAF S s to a PLS refers to the process of mapping them to 

FPL via a given encoding function. 

Definition 18. For a given encoding function ec and the associated PLS ,the encoded argumentation semantics (encoded semantics, briefly) of HAFS 

is the semantics obtained by defining models of each HAF S as models of the 

ec (HAF S ) in the associated PLS . A fuzzy encoded argumentation seman-tics (fuzzy encoded semantics, briefly) of HAFS is an encoded argumentation semantics where the PLS is instantiated as a PL [0 ,1] .

Definition 19. A translation of HAFS under a given semantics is an en-coding function tr : HAFS → F PL , HAF S 7 → tr (HAF S ), s.t. models of 

tr (HAF S ) in the PLS are in one-to-one correspondence with the models of the HAF S under the given semantics. 

Definition 20. A given semantics of HAFS is called translatable if there exists a translation of HAFS .

Obviously, an encoded argumentation semantics of HAFS is translatable. Within a PLS , the labelling for an HAF S is conceptually parallel to the assignment for its encoded formula. Thus, for the sake of ease of expression, we consider the terms “assignment” and “labelling” interchangeable. In this paper, we highlight a particular encoding of HAF S s, named a normal encoding of HAF S s (w.r.t a PLS ). 

Definition 21. The normal encoding of HAF S s (w.r.t a PLS ) is a function 

ec HN : HN → F PL such that for a given HAF S = ( A, R, T, U ) we have that 

ec HN (HAF S ) = ^

> a∈U

(a ↔ ( ^

> (b,a )∈R

¬(rab ∧ b)) ∧ ( ^

> (c,a )∈T

¬(tac ∧ ¬ c))) .

5.2. Encoding HAF S s to PL L

> 3

Let the PLS in the definition of the normal encoding be PL L 

> 3

. We present the semantic equivalence theorem between adjacent complete labelling se-mantics and encoded semantics associated with PL L 

> 3

as follows. For brevity, in the remainder of this subsection, the term complete semantics shall refer to the adjacent complete labelling semantics. 19 Theorem 3. For an HAF S = ( A, R, T, U ), an assignment is a model of the 

HAF S under complete semantics iff it is a model of ec HN (HAF S ) in PL L 

> 3

.Proof. We need to check that for a given assignment ∥ · ∥ and for each a ∈ U ,any value of a satisfies complete semantics iff ∥ V 

> a∈U

(a ↔ (V 

> (b,a )∈R

¬(rab ∧

b)) ∧ (V 

> (c,a )∈T

¬(tac ∧ ¬ c))) ∥ = 1 in PL L

. We need to discuss three cases. 

• Case 1, ∥a∥ = 1 .

∥a∥ = 1 by model ∥ · ∥ under complete semantics 

⇐⇒ [∀(b, a ) ∈ R : ∥b∥ = 0 or ∥rab ∥ = 0] and [∀(c, a ) ∈ T : ∥c∥ = 1 or 

∥tac ∥ = 0] by complete semantics 

⇐⇒ [∀(b, a ) ∈ R : ∥rab ∧ b∥ = 0] and [∀(c, a ) ∈ T : ∥tac ∧ ¬ c∥ = 0] in 

PL L

⇐⇒ ∥ a ↔ (V

.

• Case 2, ∥a∥ = 0 .

∥a∥ = 0 by model ∥ · ∥ under complete semantics 

⇐⇒ [∃(b, a ) ∈ R : ∥b∥ = 1 and ∥rab ∥ = 1 ] or [ ∃(c, a ) ∈ T : ∥c∥ = 0 and 

∥tac ∥ = 1 ] by complete semantics 

⇐⇒ [∃(b, a ) ∈ R : ∥rab ∧ b∥ = 1 ] or [ ∃(c, a ) ∈ T : ∥tac ∧ ¬ c∥ = 1 ] in PL L

¬(tac ∧ ¬ c)) ∥ = 1 in PL L

.

• Case 3, ∥a∥ = 12 .

∥a∥ = 12 by model ∥ · ∥ under complete semantics 

⇐⇒ ∥ β∦ = 1 and ∥β∦ = 0 under complete semantics 

⇐⇒ ∥ V

¬(rab ∧ b) ∧ V

¬(tac ∧ ¬ c)∥ = 12 in PL L

.

⇐⇒ ∥ a ↔ (V 

> (b,a )∈R

¬(rab ∧ b)) ∧ (V 

> (c,a )∈T

¬(tac ∧ ¬ c)) ∥ = 1 in PL L 

> 3

.20 From the three cases above, for a given assignment ∥ · ∥ , the value ∥a∥

of any a ∈ U satisfies complete semantics iff ∥a ↔ (V 

> (b,a )∈R

¬(rab ∧ b)) ∧

(V 

> (c,a )∈T

¬(tac ∧¬ c)) ∥ = 1 in PL L 

> 3

. Thus, an assignment ∥·∥ of the HAF S sat-isfies complete semantics iff the assignment ∥·∥ is a model of the ec HN (HAF S )

in PL L 

> 3

.

5.3. Encoding HAF S s to PL [0 ,1] s: fuzzy normal encoded semantics 

We first present the equational systems derived from fuzzy normal en-coded semantics. Assume a PL [0 ,1] equipped with connectives ¬, ∧, and →,where the three connectives are interpreted as the negation operation N , the t-norm operation ∗ and the R-implication operation I∗, respectively. 

Theorem 4. For an HAF S = ( A, R, T, U ), an assignment ∥ · ∥ is a model of ec HN (HAF S ) in the PL [0 ,1] iff it is a solution of the equational system 

Eq ec HN : ∀a ∈ U, 

∥a∥ = Nb ∗ Nc, (2) 

where Nb = N (∥b1∥ ∗ ∥ rab1 ∥) ∗ · · · ∗ N (∥bk∥ ∗ ∥ rabk ∥), Nc = N (N (∥c1∥) ∗ ∥ tac1 ∥) ∗· · · ∗ N (N (∥cm∥) ∗ ∥ tacm ∥), {b1, . . . , b k} is the set of all attackers of a, and 

{c1, . . . , c m} is the set of all (necessary) supporters of a.Proof. An assignment ∥ · ∥ is a model of ec HN (HAF S ) in the PL [0 ,1] 

⇐⇒ ∥ ^

> a∈U

(a ↔ ( ^

> (bi,a )∈R

¬(rabi ∧ bi)) ∧ ( ^ 

> (cj,a )∈T

¬(¬tacj ∧ cj ))) ∥ = 1 ,

⇐⇒ for each a ∈ U ,

∥a ↔ ( ^

> (bi,a )∈R

¬(rabi ∧ bi)) ∧ ( ^ 

> (cj,a )∈T

¬(¬tacj ∧ cj )) ∥ = 1 ,

⇐⇒ for each a ∈ U ,

∥a∥ = ∥( ^

> (bi,a )∈R

¬(rabi ∧ bi)) ∧ ( ^ 

> (cj,a )∈T

¬(¬tacj ∧ cj )) ∥,

i.e., 

∥a∥ = Nb ∗ Nc,

where Nb = N (∥b1∥ ∗ ∥ rab1 ∥) ∗ · · · ∗ N (∥bk∥ ∗ ∥ rabk ∥) and Nc = N (N (∥c1∥) ∗∥tac1 ∥) ∗ · · · ∗ N (N (∥cm∥) ∗ ∥ tacm ∥) and {b1, . . . , b k} is the set of all attackers of a and {c1, . . . , c m} is the set of all (necessary) supporters of a.21 Definition 22. For any HAF S , the equational system Eq ec HN associated with a fuzzy normal encoded semantics is called the fuzzy normal encoded equational system (abbreviated as the encoded equational system ). 

Without causing confusion, and based on Theorem 4, we also denote the fuzzy normal encoded semantics associated with the given PL [0 ,1] by Eq ec HN .If N and ∗ are continuous, then the Equation 2 is continuous, and we denote the associated continuous fuzzy normal encoded equational system as Eq ec HN  

> con

.Then from the existence theorem of the solution of a continuous equational system [19], we have the existence theorem of the solution of Eq ec HN  

> con

below. 

Theorem 5. There exists a solution of the continuous fuzzy normal encoded equational system Eq ec HN  

> con

for a given HAF S .

Definition 23. The encoded equational function associated with Eq ec HN is defined as a function hec HN : [0 , 1] 2k+2 m → [0 , 1] (k ⩾ 0, m ⩾ 0),

It is easy to see that the equational function hec HN satisfies decreasing monotonic-ity w.r.t. any variable in Dec and satisfies increasing monotonicity w.r.t. any variable in Inc .Next we state and demonstrate some properties of the encoded equational function hec HN .

5.4. Encoding HAF S s to three important PL [0 ,1] s

In this subsection, we will encode AF s to three specific PL [0 ,1] s (PL G

> [0 ,1]

,

PL P 

> [0 ,1]

and PL L

> [0 ,1]

). We first present the equational system Eq G: ∀a ∈ U, 

∥a∥ = min { k

min  

> i=1

max {1 − ∥ bi∥, 1 − ∥ rabi ∥} , m

min  

> i=1

max {∥ ci∥, 1 − ∥ taci ∥}} ,

where {b1, . . . , b k} is the set of all attackers of a, and {c1, . . . , c m} is the set of all (necessary) supporters of a.

Theorem 7. An assignment is a model of an HAF S under equational se-mantics Eq G iff it is a model of ec HN (HAF S ) in PL G

> [0 ,1]

.Proof. Let the PL [0 ,1] in Theorem 4 be PL G 

> [0 ,1]

with the standard negation, the Gödel t-norm ∗, and the R-implication I∗. Then from Theorem 4 for an 

HAF S = ( A, R, T, U ), an assignment ∥ · ∥ is a model of ec HN (HAF S ) in 

PL G 

> [0 ,1]

iff it is a solution of the equational system: ∀a ∈ U ,

∥a∥ = NGb ∗ NGc ,

23 where {b1, . . . , b k} is the set of all attackers of a, {c1, . . . , c m} is the set of all (necessary) supporters of a, and we have that 

NGb = N (∥b1∥ ∗ ∥ rab1 ∥) ∗ · · · ∗ N (∥bk∥ ∗ ∥ rabk ∥)= k

min  

> i=1

(1 − min {∥ bi∥, ∥rabi ∥} )= k

min  

> i=1

max {1 − ∥ bi∥, 1 − ∥ rabi ∥} 

and 

NGc = N (N (∥c1∥) ∗ ∥ tac1 ∥) ∗ · · · ∗ N (N (∥cm∥) ∗ ∥ tacm ∥)= m

min  

> i=1

(1 − min {1 − ∥ ci∥, ∥taci ∥} )= m

min  

> i=1

max {∥ ci∥, 1 − ∥ taci ∥} .

Thus we have that 

NGb ∗ NGc = min { k

min  

> i=1

max {1 − ∥ bi∥, 1 − ∥ rabi ∥} , m

min  

> i=1

max {∥ ci∥, 1 − ∥ taci ∥}} .

Thus, an assignment ∥ · ∥ is a model of ec HN (HAF S ) in PL G

> [0 ,1]

⇐⇒ it is a solution of the equational system: ∀a ∈ U ,

∥a∥ = min { k

min  

> i=1

max {1 − ∥ bi∥, 1 − ∥ rabi ∥} , m

min  

> i=1

max {∥ ci∥, 1 − ∥ taci ∥}} ,

where {b1, . . . , b k} is the set of all attackers of a, and {c1, . . . , c m} is the set of all (necessary) supporters of a

⇐⇒ it is a model of the HAF S under equational semantics Eq G.From this theorem, we immediately obtain the following corollary. 

Corollary 1. The equational semantics Eq G is translatable via ec HN and 

PL G

> [0 ,1]

, i.e., it is equivalent to a fuzzy normal encoded semantics associated with PL G

> [0 ,1]

.

24 Next, we present the equational semantics Eq P and show the theorem of model equivalence between Eq P and the fuzzy normal encoded semantics associated with PL P

> [0 ,1]

.We give the equational system Eq P : ∀a ∈ U, 

∥a∥ =

> k

Y

> i=1

(1 − ∥ bi∥∥ rabi ∥)

> m

Y

> i=1

(1 − ∥ taci ∥ + ∥ci∥∥ taci ∥),

where {b1, . . . , b k} is the set of all attackers of a, and {c1, . . . , c m} is the set of all (necessary) supporters of a.

Theorem 8. An assignment is a model of an HAF S under equational se-mantics Eq P iff it is a model of ec HN (HAF S ) in PL P

> [0 ,1]

.Proof. Let the PL [0 ,1] in Theorem 4 be PL P 

> [0 ,1]

with the standard negation, the Product t-norm ∗, and the R-implication I∗. Then from Theorem 4 for an HAF S = ( A, R, T, U ), an assignment ∥ · ∥ is a model of ec HN (HAF S ) in 

PL P 

> [0 ,1]

iff it is a solution of the equational system: ∀a ∈ U ,

∥a∥ = NPb ∗ NPc ,

where {b1, . . . , b k} is the set of all attackers of a, {c1, . . . , c m} is the set of all (necessary) supporters of a, and we have that 

NPb = N (∥b1∥ ∗ ∥ rab1 ∥) ∗ · · · ∗ N (∥bk∥ ∗ ∥ rabk ∥)=

> k

Y

> i=1

(1 − ∥ bi∥∥ rabi ∥)

and 

NPc = N (N (∥c1∥) ∗ ∥ tac1 ∥) ∗ · · · ∗ N (N (∥cm∥) ∗ ∥ tacm ∥)=

> m

Y

> i=1

(1 − (1 − ∥ ci∥)∥taci ∥)=

> m

Y

> i=1

(1 − ∥ taci ∥ + ∥ci∥∥ taci ∥).

25 Thus we have that 

NPb ∗ NPc =

> k

Y

> i=1

(1 − ∥ bi∥∥ rabi ∥)

> m

Y

> i=1

(1 − ∥ taci ∥ + ∥ci∥∥ taci ∥).

Thus, an assignment ∥ · ∥ is a model of ec HN (HAF S ) in PL P

> [0 ,1]

⇐⇒ it is a solution of the equational system: ∀a ∈ U ,

∥a∥ =

> k

Y

> i=1

(1 − ∥ bi∥∥ rabi ∥)

> m

Y

> i=1

(1 − ∥ taci ∥ + ∥ci∥∥ taci ∥),

where {b1, . . . , b k} is the set of all attackers of a, and {c1, . . . , c m} is the set of all (necessary) supporters of a

⇐⇒ it is a model of the HAF S under equational semantics Eq P .From this theorem, we have the corollary below. 

Corollary 2. The equational semantics Eq P is translatable via ec HN and 

PL P

> [0 ,1]

, i.e., it is equivalent to a fuzzy normal encoded semantics associated with PL P

> [0 ,1]

.

By letting the PL [0 ,1] in Theorem 4 be PL L 

> [0 ,1]

(equipped with the standard negation, the Łukasiewicz t-norm ∗, and the R-implication I∗), we obtain an equational system Eq L as an instantiation of Eq ec HN . The corresponding model equivalence theorem follows from this specification. Since the equa-tional system Eq L has a complex specific form, we refrain from presenting its details. Interested readers can derive it by themselves. 

5.5. Relationships between complete semantics and fuzzy normal encoded se-mantics Eq ec HN 

Exploring the relationships between complete semantics and fuzzy normal encoded semantics can help us find the connections between 3-valued seman-tics and [0,1]-valued semantics. It can also help us choose proper PL [0 ,1] s for encoding when we want to align the fuzzy normal encoded semantics with the complete semantics in an expected way. Additionally, the model equivalence between the complete semantics and fuzzy normal encoded semantics (with a technical treatment) gives us a new approach to calculating the models of the complete semantics. 26 5.5.1. The relationship (I) between complete semantics and Eq ec HN with zero-divisor free t-norms 

Suppose that the PL ⊚ 

> [0 ,1]

in Theorem 4 is equipped with a negation N ,a zero-divisor-free t-norm ⊚ and an R-implication I⊚. We denote the corre-sponding encoded semantics by Eq ec HN  

> ⊚

: ∀a ∈ U ,

∥a∥ = Nb ⊚ Nc,

where Nb = N (∥b1∥ ⊚ ∥rab1 ∥) ⊚ · · · ⊚ N (∥bk∥ ⊚ ∥rabk ∥), Nc = N (N (∥c1∥) ⊚

∥tac1 ∥) ⊚ · · · ⊚ N (N (∥cm∥) ⊚ ∥tacm ∥), {b1, . . . , b k} is the set of all attackers of 

a, and {c1, . . . , c m} is the set of all (necessary) supporters of a.

Theorem 9. For an HAF S and an encoded semantics Eq ec HN

, if an as-signment ∥ · ∥ is a model of the HAF S under the Eq ec HN  

> ⊚

, then T3(∥ · ∥ ) is a model of the HAF S under the complete semantics. Proof. For a given HAF S , for any a ∈ U , let {b1, b 2, . . . , b k} be the set of all attackers of a and {c1, . . . , c m} be the set of all (necessary) supporters of 

a. If an assignment ∥ · ∥ is a model of the HAF S under the Eq ec HN  

> ⊚

, then denoting T3(∥ · ∥ ) by ∥ · ∥ 3, we have 

∥a∥3 =



1 iff ∥a∥ = 1 ,

0 iff ∥a∥ = 0 , 

> 12

otherwise .

Then we need to discuss three cases. 

• Case 1, ∥a∥3 = 0 .

∥a∥3 = 0 

⇐⇒ ∥ a∥ = 0 

⇐⇒ N (∥b1∥ ⊚ ∥rab1 ∥) ⊚ · · · ⊚ N (∥bk∥ ⊚ ∥rabk ∥) ⊚ N (N (∥c1∥) ⊚ ∥tac1 ∥) ⊚

· · · ⊚ N (N (∥cm∥) ⊚ ∥tacm ∥) = 0 

⇐⇒ ∃ (b, a ) ∈ R : N (∥b∥ ⊚ ∥rab ∥) = 0 or ∃(c, a ) ∈ T : N (N (∥c∥) ⊚

∥tac ∥) = 0 

⇐⇒ ∃ (b, a ) ∈ R : ∥b∥ ⊚ ∥rab ∥ = 1 or ∃(c, a ) ∈ T : N (∥c∥) ⊚ ∥tac ∥ = 1 

⇐⇒ ∃ (b, a ) ∈ R : ∥b∥ = ∥rab ∥ = 1 or ∃(c, a ) ∈ T : ∥c∥ = 0 and ∥tac ∥ = 1 

⇐⇒ ∃ (b, a ) ∈ R : ∥b∥3 = ∥rab ∥3 = 1 or ∃(c, a ) ∈ T : ∥c∥3 = 0 and 

∥tac ∥3 = 1 

⇐⇒ for the assignment ∥ · ∥ 3, ∥a∥3 = 0 satisfies complete semantics. 27 • Case 2, ∥a∥3 = 1 .

∥a∥3 = 1 

⇐⇒ ∥ a∥ = 1 

⇐⇒ N (∥b1∥ ⊚ ∥rab1 ∥) ⊚ · · · ⊚ N (∥bk∥ ⊚ ∥rabk ∥) ⊚ N (N (∥c1∥) ⊚ ∥tac1 ∥) ⊚

⇐⇒ N (∥b1∥ ⊚ ∥rab1 ∥) = · · · = N (∥bk∥ ⊚ ∥rabk ∥) = N (N (∥c1∥) ⊚ ∥tac1 ∥) =

⇐⇒ ∥ b1∥ ⊚ ∥rab1 ∥ = · · · = ∥bk∥ ⊚ ∥rabk ∥ = N (∥c1∥) ⊚ ∥tac1 ∥ = · · · =

N (∥cm∥) ⊚ ∥tacm ∥ = 0 

⇐⇒ [∀(b, a ) ∈ R : ∥b∥ = 0 or ∥rab ∥ = 0] and [∀(c, a ) ∈ T : ∥c∥ =1 or ∥tac ∥ = 0] 

⇐⇒ [∀(b, a ) ∈ R : ∥b∥3 = 0 or ∥rab ∥3 = 0] and [∀(c, a ) ∈ T : ∥c∥3 =1 or ∥tac ∥3 = 0] 

⇐⇒ for the assignment ∥ · ∥ 3, ∥a∥3 = 1 satisfies complete semantics. 

• Case 3, ∥a∥3 = 12 .

∥a∥3 = 12

⇐⇒ not the case ∥a∥3 = 1 or ∥a∥3 = 0 

⇐⇒ for the assignment ∥ · ∥ 3, neither ∥a∥3 = 1 nor ∥a∥3 = 0 satisfies the complete semantics 

⇐⇒ for the assignment ∥ · ∥ 3, ∥a∥3 = 12 satisfies complete semantics. From the three cases, for a given model ∥ · ∥ of an HAF S under Eq ec HN

,

T3(∥ · ∥ ) is a model of the HAF S under the complete semantics. This theorem shows that each model of an HAF S under an encoded semantics Eq ec HN

can be turned into a model of the HAF S under the com-plete semantics by the ternarization function T3. Since PL P

,from Theorem 9, we have the corollary below. 

Corollary 3. For an HAF S and the encoded semantics Eq P , if an assign-ment ∥ · ∥ is a model of the HAF S under the Eq P , then T3(∥ · ∥ ) is a model of the HAF S under the complete semantics. 5.5.2. The relationship (II) between complete semantics and Eq ec HN with 12 -idempotent t-norms 

Next we explore the situation that a model of an HAF S under complete semantics is a model of the HAF S under a characterized encoded semantics. We give the characterized t-norm below. 28 Definition 24. An 12 -idempotent t-norm is a t-norm ⊙ that satisfies 12 ⊙ 12 =

Suppose that the PL ⊙

5.5.3. The relationship (III) between complete semantics and Eq ec HN with zero-divisor free 12 -idempotent t-norms 

Suppose that the PL ⊖

6. Conclusion 

This paper addresses critical limitations in existing higher-order bipolar 

AF s and their logical encodings, proposing a systematic solution through the 

HAF S and its associated semantic and encoding methodologies. Below is a concise summary of the research contributions, theoretical implications, and future directions: 

6.1. Summary of Core Contributions 

First, at the syntactic level, we extend the HOAF N to the HAF S , break-ing the long-standing restriction that only arguments can act as attackers or supporters. By explicitly allowing attacks and supports to serve as both tar-gets and sources of interactions (i.e., U = A ∪ R ∪ T and R, T ⊆ U × U ), the 

HAF S enables modeling of complex dialectical scenarios where higher-order relations (attacks on attacks, supports for supports) are essential, enhancing both theoretical uniformity and real-world applicability. Second, in terms of semantics, we establish a coherent and expressive se-mantic suite for HAF S s, encompassing three complementary types: extension-based semantics (conflict-free, admissible, complete, preferred, stable, and grounded extensions), adjacent complete labelling semantics (a 3-valued se-mantics with labels 0, 1, 12 ), and numerical equational semantics ( [0 , 1] -valued fuzzy semantics). This suite unifies discrete three-valued reasoning and con-tinuous fuzzy reasoning, addressing the gap between multi-valued and fuzzy semantics in existing higher-order bipolar AF s. Key theoretical results in-clude the equivalence between extension-derived complete labellings and ad-jacent complete labellings for support-acyclic HAF S s (Theorem 2), and the 31 mutual translatability between 3-valued complete semantics and fuzzy equa-tional semantics under specific t-norms (Theorems 8–9 and Corollaries 4–5). Third, regarding logical encoding, we develop a normal encoding function 

ec HN that bridges HAF S s to propositional logic systems ( PLS s). We prove that HAF S s under adjacent complete labelling semantics are semantically equivalent to Łukasiewicz’s three-valued logic ( PL L 

> 3

) theories (Theorem 3), and HAF S s under equational semantics can be encoded into fuzzy PLS s(e.g., PL G

> [0 ,1]

, PL P

> [0 ,1]

, PL L

> [0 ,1]

) via equational systems (Theorems 4, 6, 7). This encoding methodology avoids the syntactic overhead of first-order or modal logics, enabling seamless interoperability with lightweight computa-tional solvers and providing a rigorous logical foundation for HAF S seman-tics. 

6.2. Theoretical and Practical Implications 

Theoretically, this work advances the formalization of higher-order argu-mentation by: (1) generalizing RAF N semantics to HAF S s, ensuring that the validity of attacks/supports is independent of their sources (aligning with classical logical intuitions); (2) resolving the treatment of support cycles by allowing extensions to include elements in valid support cycles (contrasting with existing approaches that outright reject such elements); (3) establish-ing a unified framework for linking discrete and continuous argumentation semantics, facilitating cross-paradigm generalization. Practically, the proposed encoding methodology translates HAF S s into computationally tractable logical formulas, enabling the use of existing PLS 

solvers to compute argument acceptability. This overcomes the impracti-cality of complex logical encodings (e.g., first-order or modal logics) in real-world applications, making higher-order bipolar argumentation accessible for scenarios such as multi-agent reasoning, legal dispute resolution, and risk as-sessment. 

6.3. Limitations and Future Work 

Despite its contributions, this work has several limitations that merit fur-ther exploration. For example, this study focuses on static HAF S s; dynamic extensions (e.g., adding/removing arguments/relations) and their logical en-codings remain an open issue. Future work may proceed in three directions: (1) extending the HAF S 

to handle dynamic changes and weighted relations, with applications to real-time decision-making scenarios; (2) conducting empirical evaluations to val-32 idate the computational efficiency of the proposed encoding methodology using PLS solvers (e.g., fuzzy logic toolboxes or three-valued logic reason-ers); (3) exploring cross-fertilization with other logical systems (e.g., adaptive logics or paraconsistent logics) to enhance the handling of inconsistency and uncertainty in complex argumentation. In conclusion, this paper lays the groundwork for a unified theory of higher-order bipolar argumentation, bridging syntactic expressiveness, se-mantic coherence, and logical computability. The HAF S and its encoding methodologies not only address foundational gaps in argumentation theory but also provide a practical tool for modeling and reasoning about complex, uncertain dialectical interactions.
