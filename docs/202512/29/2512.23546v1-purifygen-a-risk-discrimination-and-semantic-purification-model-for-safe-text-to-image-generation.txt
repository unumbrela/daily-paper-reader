Abstract
Recent advances in diffusion models have notably enhanced text-
to-image (T2I) generation quality, but they also raise the risk of
generating unsafe content. Traditional safety methods like text
blacklisting or harmful content classification have significant draw-
backs: they can be easily circumvented or require extensive datasets
and extra training. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Pu-
rifyGen, a novel, training-free approach for safe T2I generation
that retains the model’s original weights. PurifyGen introduces a
dual-stage strategy for prompt purification. First, we evaluate the
safety of each token in a prompt by computing its complementary
semantic distance, which measures the semantic proximity between
the prompt tokens and concept embeddings from predefined toxic
and clean lists. This enables fine-grained prompt classification with-
out explicit keyword matching or retraining. Tokens closer to toxic
concepts are flagged as risky. Second, for risky prompts, we apply
a dual-space transformation: we project toxic-aligned embeddings
into the null space of the toxic concept matrix, effectively removing
harmful semantic components, and simultaneously align them into
the range space of clean concepts. This dual alignment purifies
risky prompts by both subtracting unsafe semantics and reinforc-
ing safe ones, while retaining the original intent and coherence.
We further define a token-wise strategy to selectively replace only
risky token embeddings, ensuring minimal disruption to safe con-
tent. PurifyGen offers a plug-and-play solution with theoretical
grounding and strong generalization to unseen prompts and models.
Extensive testing shows that PurifyGen surpasses current meth-
ods in reducing unsafe content across five datasets and competes
well with training-dependent approaches. The code can refer to

Introduction
In just a few years, generative AI has evolved from simple text com-
pletion into a comprehensive creative toolkit that now powers di-
verse media pipelines. Breakthroughs first showcased by large-scale
language models [1] have since migrated to automated program
synthesis [4], fully synthetic audio tracks [6, 25], photorealistic im-
age fabrication [16, 42], and the generation of temporally coherent
video sequences [16, 24, 38, 53]. Flagship systems such as DALL·E
3 [37] and OpenAI’s Sora [38] have ignited fresh workflows across
digital illustration, augmented/virtual reality, and educational me-
dia production. At the same time, these models carry a darker
potential: they can amplify societal bias, propagate discriminatory
narratives, or produce explicit and violent visuals, prompting urgent
debate on guardrails and responsible deployment. Breakthroughs

Flagship systems such as DALL·E 3 [37] and OpenAI’s Sora [38]

these models carry a darker potential: they can amplify societal bias,

lent visuals, prompting urgent debate on guardrails and responsible
deployment.
Recent efforts to render text-to-image (T2I) generators safer
have coalesced around two divergent toolkits. Unlearning methods
deliberately push the network through another round of training
so that it “forgets” objectionable visual patterns altogether [20, 40,
48, 54]. While this can scrub out unwanted content, the procedure
is computationally heavy and must be repeated whenever a new
harmful motif surfaces. Running on a different track, model-editing
algorithms perform pinpoint parameter surgery to steer generation
away from unsafe regions of the data manifold [10, 39, 49]. These

Figure 1: We present PurifyGen, a risk-discrimination and semantic-
purification model for T2I that identifies and filters out a variety
of user-defined concepts. Unlike the previous approach of filter-
ing prompts directly, which may impair the semantics of normal
prompts, PurifyGen enables the safe and faithful generation in an
interpretable manner that can remove toxic concepts and create a
safer version of inappropriate prompts without requiring any model
updates.
edits often carry a cost: image fidelity may degrade, or the model’s
broader capabilities may become destabilized, making it difficult to
remove toxic elements while preserving the user’s original intent.
An emerging, more promising line of research focuses on training-
free, filtering-based approaches. These methods aim to filter and
modify input prompts to prevent unsafe content generation while
preserving the model’s original generative capabilities. Despite
their appeal, existing filtering techniques face two critical limita-
tions. First, they lack a nuanced risk-discrimination mechanism: by
employing a hard filtering strategy that uniformly alters the input
prompt, they fail to identify and target only the risky components,
often leading to inefficient processing and unnecessary semantic
loss. Second, these methods do not incorporate a mechanism for
semantic purification, making it difficult to precisely cleanse harm-
ful elements without disrupting the intended prompt meaning. In
light of these deficiencies, it is natural to ask: Can we develop a
unified framework that both discriminates between safe and risky
prompt components and effectively sanitizes the unsafe portions while
preserving the original intent?
To overcome the limitations of existing safety approaches in
text-to-image generation, we propose PurifyGen, a training-free,
adaptive, and plug-and-play framework that ensures safe genera-
tion without modifying the pretrained weights of diffusion models.
Unlike retraining-based or rule-based systems, PurifyGen operates
entirely in the prompt embedding space, making it highly efficient,
interpretable, and broadly compatible across model architectures.
Building such a framework requires addressing two core challenges:
(C1) Prompts often contain a mixture of safe and unsafe semantics,
demanding fine-grained, token-level identification of risk rather
than coarse, prompt-level decisions. (C2) Removing risky semantics
must be done without distorting the prompt’s intended meaning,
requiring a purification strategy that both filters out harmful com-
ponents and restores alignment with safe content.
To tackle (C1), PurifyGen introduces a new semantic risk as-
sessment mechanism. We compute the complementary semantic
distance between prompt token embeddings and semantic concept
spaces to quantify their relative association with safe or unsafe
meanings. This enables fine-grained, token-wise risk discrimina-
tion that is generalizable and does not rely on hand-crafted keyword
matching. To address (C2), we propose a novel dual-space purifi-
cation strategy. Risky tokens are projected into the null space of
unsafe semantics to remove harmful content and simultaneously
aligned into the range space of clean semantics to reinforce safe
meaning. This transformation is performed selectively at the to-
ken level, ensuring that the remaining content remains coherent
and faithful to the original prompt. Extensive experiments demon-
strate that PurifyGen achieves state-of-the-art performance on five
widely used safe T2I benchmarks: I2P [44], P4D [5], Ring-A-Bell [46],
MMA-Diffusion [51], and UnlearnDiff [57]. It outperforms other
training-free methods and delivers competitive results compared
to top training-based methods.
Our contributions are threefold:
• We propose PurifyGen, a novel training-free framework for
safe text-to-image generation that performs fine-grained,
token-level risk assessment. By employing complementary
semantic distance with user-defined blacklist and whitelist
embeddings, PurifyGen enables interpretable and adaptive
identification of unsafe prompt components without requir-
ing model retraining or handcrafted keyword filtering.
• We introduce a dual-space purification mechanism that com-
bines null space projection to suppress toxic semantics and
range space alignment to enhance safe content. This geometry-
driven approach enables selective semantic editing at the
embedding level, ensuring both safety and semantic coher-
ence. The method is model-agnostic and can be integrated
seamlessly as a plug-in module for various diffusion-based
generative models.
• We demonstrate that PurifyGen achieves state-of-the-art per-
formance across public safety benchmarks, outperforming
existing training-free methods and performing competitively
against fine-tuned baselines. Our method exhibits strong
generalization to unseen prompts, concepts, and model ar-
chitectures, making it a practical and scalable solution for
safety-critical generative applications.

T2I attacks
Recent studies have highlighted vulnerabilities in generative mod-
els, including large language models (LLMs) [32, 41], vision-language
models (VLMs) [58], and text-to-image (T2I) models [29, 47, 52].
One notable vulnerability is cross-modality jailbreaks, as demon-
strated by [45], which combine adversarial images with prompts
to bypass VLM safeguards without directly targeting the language
model. Tools such as Ring-A-Bell [46] and automated adversarial
frameworks developed by [23] and [27] focus on model-agnostic
red-teaming techniques and adversarial prompt generation, un-
covering safety weaknesses. Additionally, techniques by [35], [51],
and [36] exploit text embeddings and multimodal inputs to evade
model protections, employing strategies like adversarial prompt

optimization and in-context learning [5, 33]. Collectively, these
works emphasize the significant security vulnerabilities present in
T2I models.
2.2
Safe T2I generation
Safe T2I has attract extensive attention in the past and there are
mainly two branches for the safe T2I generation as follow.
Most prior attempts to curb unsafe or undesirable content in-
tervene inside the generative model. Early work concentrates on
excising objectionable visual or textual patterns from the network
through fine-tuning or negative guidance. For example, [55] en-
larges the safety margin by stripping away hazardous motifs, while
[29] and [9] demonstrate similar effects with concept erasure. A
complementary line of inquiry frames the problem adversarially:
[22] suppresses harmful embeddings via a race-conditioned discrim-
inator, whereas [8, 40] removes disallowed representations or opti-
mizes preference scores to steer the generator away from toxic re-
gions. Beyond these, researchers have explored targeted parameter
updates, such as cross-attention refinement [34], continual-learning
filters [14], and latent-space surgery enabled by self-supervision
[28, 31]. Although these approaches can be effective, they usually
require extensive retraining, incur notable computational overhead,
and often introduce collateral degradation in visual quality.
The second is the training-free paradigm. Safety mechanisms
that sidestep any full re-training can be grouped into two broad
camps. The first is closed-form weight editing techniques, where
closed-form adjustments are computed once and grafted onto the
generator’s parameters to excise disallowed content while leav-
ing its creative range intact. Examples include model-projection
editing [10], target-embedding surgery [11], and the micro-update
recipe of [39] for diffusion backbones. A second line of work keeps
the weights frozen and instead steers generation during inference
through Safe Latent Diffusion with classifier-free guidance [44], or
via prompt-level refinements in the Ethical Diffusion framework [2].
Both families, however, have struggled to retain reliability once
deployed on previously unseen prompts. Our own approach adopts
a risk-aware, semantic purification pipeline: it screens and sanitises
the output on the fly, adapting its filters to the user’s query with-
out touching the underlying weights, thereby achieving stronger
robustness and far better scalability in practice.

Preliminary
3.1
Latent Diffusion Models
Diffusion generators [17] tackle image synthesis by beginning with
pure Gaussian noise and then iteratively cleaning it across 𝑇dis-
crete steps until a coherent picture emerges. At each timestep 𝑡, the
network is tasked with predicting the residual noise still present,
effectively acting as a time-conditioned denoiser. Latent diffusion
refines this recipe by performing the entire noise-to-signal proce-
dure in a compact latent manifold and only decoding the final latent
tensor back to pixel space at the end [43]. When extended to text-
to-image generation, the model’s denoising function is additionally
conditioned on a user prompt 𝑝. For instance, via classifier-free
guidance [18], the evolving sample gravitates toward an image
whose semantics match the supplied description.
Let 𝜖𝜃(𝑧𝑡,𝑡, 𝑝) denote the noise estimation function parameter-
ized by 𝜃. At time step 𝑡(0 < 𝑡≤𝑇), the guided noise estimate is
given by:
ˆ𝜖𝜃(𝑧𝑡,𝑡, 𝑝) = 𝜖𝜃(𝑧𝑡,𝑡, ∅) + 𝛾(𝜖𝜃(𝑧𝑡,𝑡, 𝑝) −𝜖𝜃(𝑧𝑡,𝑡, ∅)) ,
(1)
where𝛾is the guidance scale and ∅represents an empty prompt. At
the initial step𝑡= 𝑇,𝑧𝑡is sampled from a Gaussian distribution. The
latent variable 𝑧𝑡−1 is then modeled as a Gaussian with parameters
derived from 𝑧𝑡and the predicted noise:
𝑝(𝑧𝑡−1|𝑧𝑡, 𝑝) = N
 
𝑧𝑡−1;

(2)
where 𝛽𝑡denotes the noise schedule at step 𝑡, 𝛼𝑡= 1−𝛽𝑡defines the
retained signal ratio, ¯𝛼𝑡= Î𝑡
𝑖=1 𝛼𝑖, and ¯𝛽𝑡= √1 −¯𝛼𝑡. Following the
Markov property, we can compute ˆ𝑧0 to approximate the denoised
latent representation 𝑧0 [17]:
ˆ𝑧0 =
1
√¯𝛼𝑡
 𝑧𝑡−¯𝛽𝑡ˆ𝜖𝜃(𝑧𝑡,𝑡, 𝑝) .
(3)
In this way, Eq.(3) mbodies the pivotal inferential step of the
diffusion process: recovering a noise-free representation from its
corrupted counterpart. Once that estimate is available, the model
channels both the timestep-specific latent code 𝑧𝑡and its refined
prediction ˆ𝑧0 through a latent-to-pixel decoder. This mapping pro-
duces the provisional reconstruction 𝑥𝑡, reflecting the system’s
current state, and culminates in the fully denoised image ˆ𝑥0.
3.2
Null Space and Range Space: Theoretical
Foundation
In our proposed framework, semantic purification is realized through
a dual-space projection strategy where the null space is for remov-
ing toxic semantics and the range space is for aligning with clean
semantics. To ground this approach in mathematical rigor [13], we
review the foundational concepts of null space and range space, and
explain how they support our token embedding transformations in
the context of safe text-to-image generation.
Definition 3.1. Let 𝑪∈R𝑑×𝑘be a matrix formed by stacking
embedding vectors associated with a set of known toxic concepts,
where 𝑑is the embedding dimension and 𝑘is the number of toxic
concept vectors. From the linear algebra such as [13], the null
space of 𝑪, denoted as Null(𝑪), is defined as:
Null(𝑪) =

𝒙∈R𝑘| 𝑪𝒙= 0
	
.
This space contains all vectors that, when linearly combined with
the columns of 𝑪, result in zero. Intuitively, projecting a prompt
token embedding into the null space of 𝑪suppresses any compo-
nents that align with toxic semantics, effectively removing harmful
latent information.
Definition 3.2. Let 𝑹∈R𝑑×𝑘′ be a matrix composed of embedding
vectors corresponding to clean or safe concepts. The range space
(also known as the column space) of 𝑹, denoted as Range(𝑹), is
defined as:
Range(𝑹) =
n
𝒚∈R𝑑| ∃𝒙∈R𝑘′ such that 𝒚= 𝑹𝒙
o
.
This space encompasses all vectors that can be represented as linear
combinations of the clean concept embeddings. Projecting a prompt

token embedding into the range space of 𝑹reinforces its alignment
with safe, desirable semantics.
Why Null and Range Spaces Matter for Safe T2I. These two
subspaces play complementary roles in our semantic purification
strategy. The null space of 𝑪captures directions that are orthogonal
to all toxic concepts; any projection into this space effectively elim-
inates toxic semantic components. On the other hand, the range
space of 𝑹captures the span of clean semantics, and projecting into
this space encourages alignment with intended safe meanings.
According to the fundamental theorem of linear algebra, if we
consider the full Euclidean space R𝑑, the null space and row space
of a matrix are orthogonal complements, and likewise for the range
space and left null space. Specifically, applying the Rank-Nullity
Theorem to 𝑪, we have:
dim(Null(𝑪)) + dim(Range(𝑪)) = 𝑑,
which guarantees that any prompt embedding can be decomposed
into components lying in these two orthogonal subspaces.
Connection to Our Method. In our framework, we leverage this
decomposition for semantic filtering and alignment as follows. The
projection onto Null(𝑪) removes the latent toxic semantics by fil-
tering out components in the direction of toxic concept embeddings.
The projection onto Range(𝑹) ensures the prompt remains seman-
tically aligned with safe concepts, enhancing content relevance
and generation quality. This dual-space view provides a principled
geometric perspective for prompt purification. Unlike heuristic-
based editing methods, our projection-based approach is grounded
in linear algebra and applies directly in the embedding space. It
is thus interpretable, efficient, and generalizable across tasks and
models, laying a solid theoretical foundation for safe and faithful
generation in diffusion models.

PurifyGen Framework
Recent approaches [3, 10, 11, 34, 50] have demonstrated the ef-
fectiveness of weight modification through unlearning or model
editing to prevent the generation of harmful (e.g., pornography, self-
harm, violence), biased (e.g., racial or social stereotypes, ageism),
or otherwise undesirable (e.g., public, copyrighted) visual content
in text-to-image generation models. However, these methods have
limited flexibility as they require storing individual model weights
for each concept to be removed, inherently reduce the backbone
model’s generative capabilities through unlearning, and necessitate
separate solutions for safe generation across different models (i.e.,
modified model weights).
To overcome these challenges, we introduce PurifyGen. Our ap-
proach aims to position the prompt close to a list of clean concepts
and distant from toxic ones. Initially, we measure the distances be-
tween the prompt tokens and these lists to assess the prompt’s risk
level. We employ the complementary semantic distance to gauge
the similarity between the prompt and both the clean and toxic lists.
If the prompt’s token embeddings are nearer to the clean list than
the toxic list, we classify it as safe, allowing direct input into the
diffusion model. Otherwise, we transform the prompt embeddings
using null and range spaces as semantic regularizers—the former to
deter toxic information and the latter to align with safe information.
This method enables dual-level alignment, thereby ensuring the
generation of safe contexts.
4.1
Discriminate the Safety of Prompts
In text-to-image generation tasks, prompts often contain a mix
of both toxic and clean content rather than being entirely one or
the other. This necessitates the identification of individual tokens
within the prompt to determine whether they are safe or pose a
risk. For instance, assuming 𝑝T2I=“a man gets killed", only the verb
“killed" is related to “murder", while “a”, “man”, and “gets” carry no
harmful concept.
To this end, we propose to detect token embeddings that trigger
inappropriate image generation and generate the toxic and clean
lists of the concepts as follows:
𝑪= [𝒄0; 𝒄1; . . . ; 𝒄𝐾−1] ∈R𝐷×𝐾,
𝑹= [𝒄′
0; 𝒄′
1; . . . ; 𝒄′
𝐾−1] ∈R𝐷×𝐾,
(4)
which represents the embedding matrix that denotes the toxic sub-
space. In this way, each column vector 𝒄𝑘∈𝑪corresponds to the
embedding of the relevant text associated with the user-defined
toxic concept, such as Sexual Acts or Pornography for Nudity con-
cepts. Each column vector 𝒄′
𝑘∈𝑹corresponds to the embedding
of the clean text associated contract with the user-defined toxic
concept, such as purity or modesty for non-violence concepts.
Merely checking the cosine similarity between a token and the
toxic anchors is unreliable: a high-dimensional embedding can be
close to both safe and unsafe directions, or to neither. What we truly
need is a score that reflects the residual information that survives
outside each concept subspace. In this way, for the prompt 𝑝, moti-
vated by previous work [11, 21], we identify the complementary
semantic distance of 𝑝with 𝑪or 𝑹as follows:
D(𝑪, 𝒑) = (𝑰−𝑪)𝒑𝑇,
(5)
D(𝑹, 𝒑) = (𝑰−𝑹)𝒑𝑇,
(6)
where 𝑰is the identity matrix. 𝐼−C and 𝐼−R act as lightweight
projectors onto the complements of Stox and Ssafe, respectively.
Intuitively, if the token is closer to the safe concepts than the
unsafe concepts in the latent space, the token of the prompt is safe.
Otherwise, it is unsafe:
𝑝𝑖=
(
risky,
if D(𝑪, 𝒑𝑖) ≤D(𝑹, 𝒑𝑖),
safe,
if D(𝑪, 𝒑𝑖) > D(𝑹, 𝒑𝑖).
(7)
One can observe that this operation is highly efficient and incurs
minimal computational overhead, as 𝒉𝑐can be pre-computed and
stored for fast inference. In this way, we classify the prompt as safe
or unsafe. Unsafe prompts are filtered, safe prompts are generated
directly, and for risky prompts, we purify them as follows.
4.2
Purification for Prompts
Null space projection is a common technique for removing the
influence of a given perturbation. In this work, we adopt the null
space projection method to purify the prompt. Specifically, we first
compute the null space of the covariance matrix of the prompt, and
then project the prompt onto the null space to remove the influence
of the perturbation. Following the existing methods for conducting


PurifyGen: A Risk-Discrimination and Semantic-Purification Model for Safe Text-to-Image Generation
MM’25, October 27–31, 2025, Dublin, Ireland
Figure 2: Illustrations of our framework. Given the white and black checklist and the prompt, we first mine the semantic
relationship between prompts with toxic/clean concepts. Later, we determine whether it is a safe, unsafe, or risky prompt, and
for the risky ones, we perform the dual-space alignment purification operation. Then, based on our purified prompt embedding,
we generate a secure image.
null space projection, we first apply a singular value decomposition
(SVD) to 𝑪:
{𝑈, Λ, (𝑈)𝑇} = SVD (𝑪) ,
(8)
where each column in 𝑈is an eigenvector of 𝑪. Then, we remove
the eigenvectors in 𝑈that correspond to non-zero eigenvalues, and
define the remaining submatrix as ˆ𝑈. Based on this, the projection
matrix 𝑃can be defined as 𝑽= ˆ𝑈( ˆ𝑈)𝑇. Then we have the projected
prompt as follows:
𝒑purification
𝑖
= (𝑰−𝑽𝑽𝑇)𝒑𝒊,
(9)
In the above, we propose to leverage the null space projection to
avoid toxic information. However, previous work often overlooks
the alignment with safe information, and push them into the safe
space. Then we design the alignment as follows:
Let 𝑹be a matrix representing safe information, and let 𝑷be
an input matrix. The projection of 𝒑𝑖onto the space spanned by 𝑹
ensures alignment with safe information, as defined by:
𝒑align
𝑖
= 𝒑𝑖𝑹𝑇(𝑹𝑇)†𝑹,
(10)
where (𝑹𝑇)† is the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse of 𝑹𝑇. This op-
eration ensures that 𝑷align lies in the column space of 𝑹, thereby
aligning 𝑷with the safe information represented by 𝑹.
Suppose that 𝑷is the embeddings of the prompt, and 𝑅is the
mebeddings of the reverse matrix. Then we have the dual-space
alignment theory as follows:
𝑷∗=𝑷purification + 𝑷align
=
(𝑰−𝑽𝑽𝑇)𝑷
|        {z        }
Avoid Toxic Information
+
𝑷𝑹𝑇(𝑹𝑇)†𝑹
|         {z         }
Align with Safe Information
.
(11)
In this way, we generate the new prompt 𝑷∗from the original
prompt 𝑷by avoiding the toxic information and aligning with the
safe information. Different from previous work, we do not need
to train a new model to generate the safe prompt. Instead, we can
directly generate the safe prompt from the original prompt.
4.3
Safe Generation
We aim to project toxic concept tokens into a safer space to en-
courage the model to generate appropriate images. In the previ-
ous sections, we introduced a dual-space alignment strategy that
combines null space projection to remove semantic components
associated with toxic concepts and range space alignment to re-
inforce similarity with clean, safe concepts. This transformation
yields a purified prompt embedding 𝑷∗, which is semantically safer
and better aligned for responsible generation. However, directly
substituting the entire prompt with its purified counterpart may
not always be optimal.
In most real-world queries, the objectionable meaning is con-
centrated in a handful of words; the remainder of the prompt is in-
nocuous yet vital for conveying intent with natural flow. A blanket
overhaul, whether by masking every token or applying a uniform
replacement, shreds that fluency and expressiveness, particularly
when the “toxic slice" is small. Equally crude fixes, such as stuffing
flagged slots with random vocabulary, zero vectors, or a static “safe"
stub, fracture sentence structure and introduce semantic drift, often
yielding gibberish generations.
To avoid these pitfalls, we adopt an adaptive, token-wise purifi-
cation routine. Let P𝑖be the embedding of the 𝑖-th token. Using
the Semantic-based risk test from Section 4.1, we label each token
as risky or benign. Risky embeddings are swapped for sanitised
counterparts P∗
𝑖generated by our dual-space aligner, while benign
ones remain untouched to preserve fidelity. The resulting prompt

embedding is therefore
Psafe


P∗
𝑖,
if the token is risky,
P𝑖,
otherwise.
(12)
Compared to prior methods that indiscriminately suppress or
remove toxic cues, our approach offers a more fine-grained and
context-aware solution.This design ensures minimal perturbation
to the input prompt, offering a balance between semantic safety
and content preservation.

Experimental Results
5.1
Experimental Setup
Our experimental backbone is Stable Diffusion v1.4 (SD-v1.4) [43],
the same engine that underpins several recent safety-oriented
studies [9–11]. To probe each method’s resilience, we barrage it
with adversarial prompts sourced from five red-teaming pipelines:
I2P [44], P4D [5], Ring-a-Bell [46], MMA-Diffusion [51], and Un-
learnDiff [57]. Following the evaluation recipe in [9], we addition-
ally assess the capacity to strip copyrighted or trademarked artistic
styles. All these styles can be reproducible by SD-v1.4, making them
a stringent test bed for style-suppression techniques.
Baselines. Our method is compared against several training-free
approaches: SLD [44] and UCE [10]. For training-based methods,
including ESD [9], SA [14], CA [26], MACE [34], SDID [28], SAFREE
[21], and RECE [11].
Evaluation Metrics. We quantify how effectively each defence
blocks illicit nudity requests by reporting the attack success rate
(ASR) introduced in [11]; lower is safer. For benign generations we
sample 1 000 COCO-30k captions [30] and compute three comple-
mentary metrics: Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) [15] for distri-
butional realism, the CLIP similarity score for semantic alignment,
and TIFA [19] for text–image faithfulness. When evaluating artist-
signature removal, visual discrepancy between the output and an
unaltered reference is gauged with LPIPS [56]. In addition, we recast
the task as a multi-choice quiz: an autonomous GPT-4o agent [12]
is asked to guess the artist underlying each generated picture. A
higher error rate implies more successful style suppression.
5.2
Experimental Results
Overall Performance. We subjected each safety mechanism to
a rigorous suite of red-team prompts and tallied the fraction of
queries that still slipped through, reported as the attack success
rate (ASR). As summarised in Table 1, PurifyGen posts the lowest
ASR across every attack variant, eclipsing all other training-free
baselines. Compared with the strongest prior defences, such as I2P,
MMA-Diffusion, and UnlearnDiff. Our method drives the success
rate sharply downward, underscoring a step-change in robustness
against adversarial provocations.
Comparison to Training-based Methods. In our comparison
with training-based approaches, we find that PurifyGen achieves
performance on par with these techniques. As demonstrated in
Table 1 and Figure 3, while methods such as SA and MACE demon-
strate strong safety capabilities, they often cause significant degra-
dation in image quality due to the extensive modifications to the SD
weights. These alterations typically introduce noticeable distortions,
making these methods impractical for real-world use. In contrast,
as demonstrated on the COCO-30k dataset, PurifyGen provides
similar safeguarding performance while maintaining high-quality
image generation without training.
Figure 2 illustrates qualitative comparisons across multiple base-
lines and our proposed method PurifyGen for two representative
concept removal scenarios: nudity (Case 1) and Van Gogh style (Case
2). These examples provide compelling evidence of PurifyGen’s
ability to precisely remove undesired content while maintaining
semantic fidelity and image quality. In Case 1, where the goal is
to eliminate nudity, we observe that baselines such as CA, UCE,
and RECE either fail to completely suppress explicit content or
introduce significant visual artifacts and distortions. For example,
CA and UCE often preserve recognizable body parts while crudely
masking others, leading to incoherent or ambiguous images. On
the other hand, SLD attempts to suppress nudity but occasionally
over-censors the image, introducing structural inconsistencies or
damaging the prompt’s intent. In contrast, PurifyGen successfully
removes the nudity while preserving the context, pose, and artis-
tic style of the original image. The output images remain faithful
to the prompt’s broader semantics, such as clothing style or char-
acter composition, highlighting the precision of our token-wise
purification mechanism.
In Case 2, we task each method with removing stylistic attributes
associated with the "Van Gogh" concept. Again, baseline methods
struggle to decouple style from content. For instance, CA, UCE, and
RECE only partially reduce Van Gogh’s characteristic brushstroke
patterns, often leaving residual stylization or transforming the
prompt into low-quality outputs. SLD, while better at abstraction,
sometimes introduces unnatural textures or degrades the vibrancy
of the image. By contrast, PurifyGen consistently generates outputs
that are stylistically distinct from Van Gogh’s artwork while main-
taining the original scene layout and compositional structure. For
example, our method transforms Van Gogh-style sunflowers into
realistic floral arrangements, preserving subject matter without
carrying over unwanted stylistic influence.
Ablation Studies. We assess the contributions of three key com-
ponents of PurifyGen in Table 4 using SD-v1.4. We denote the com-
ponent including discriminating the risky of prompt as DSP. We
denote the purification component as PP. We denote the alignment
component as PA. In this way, one can observe that all variants
substantially reduce the performance from adversarial prompts,
confirming the effectiveness of our components.
With all three modules active the system achieves the uniformly
best numbers: 0.377 on P4D, 0.550 on MMA, and a mere 0.126 on
Ring-a-Bell, up to a 55 % reduction in the hardest setting, while
simultaneously improving image realism (FID 134.2) and text-image
correspondence (CLIP 30.1). The monotonic improvement from
single- to dual-component variants, and the decisive leap with the
full trio, demonstrates that DSP pinpoints the threat, PP neutralises
it, and PA restores coherence; the trio works synergistically to
shrink the adversarial surface and polish visual quality, showing
that safety enforcement need not compromise generative fidelity
in a training-free pipeline.

Further Experimantal Analysis
Evaluating PurifyGen on Artist Concept Removal Tasks. In
Table 2, we show that PurifyGen outperforms baseline methods in
terms of LPIPS𝑒and LPIPS𝑢scores. We focus on comparing with
the training-free methods. The improved performance is attributed
to our approach’s denoising process, which is guided by a coher-
ent, projected conditional embedding within the input space. To
evaluate whether the generated art styles are accurately removed
or preserved, we frame these tasks as a multiple-choice question-
answering problem, moving beyond simple feature-level distance
measures. In this context, Acc𝑒and Acc𝑢represent the average
accuracy of removed and retained artist styles predicted by GPT-4o
based on the corresponding text prompts. As shown in Table 2,
PurifyGen demonstrates strong performance in removing targeted

representations of the target artists.
Transfer to Text–to–Video. We next test whether PurifyGen’s
safeguards extend beyond still imagery by grafting it onto two
leading T2V diffusion systems: ZeroScopeT2V, whose denoiser is
UNet-based, and CogVideoX-5B, built around a Diffusion Trans-
former. Both hybrids are evaluated on the SafeSora benchmark [7],
which spans a comprehensive roster of unsafe themes. Results (Ta-
ble 3, Fig. 4) reveal a steep contraction of harmful frames across all
five risk classes. Concretely, ZeroScopeT2V’s sexual-content rate
Figure 4: Experimental results with CogVideoX.
falls from 51.51 % to 13.26 %, with violent scenes dropping from
71.68 % to 48.61 %. An analogous pattern appears for CogVideoX-
5B. These outcomes confirm that PurifyGen generalises smoothly
to moving-image synthesis and remains effective across disparate
generative backbones, positioning it as a scalable safety layer for
both video and image pipelines.
Efficiency of PurifyGen. In this section, we compare the efficiency
of various methods, including the training-based ESD/CA, which
relies on online optimization and loss to update model weights,
and the training-free UCE/RECE, which modify model attention
weights through closed-form edits. Our method (PurifyGen), similar
to SLD, is training-free and based on filtering without requiring
any alterations to the diffusion model weights. As shown in Table 5,
while UCE/RECE allows for rapid model editing, they still require
additional time for model updates. In contrast, PurifyGen does
not necessitate any model edits or modifications, offering greater
flexibility for model development across varying conditions while
maintaining competitive generation speeds. Based on the results
presented in Table 5, PurifyGen demonstrates superior performance
in concept safeguarding, generation quality, and flexibility, making
it a highly efficient solution.

Conclusion
In this paper, we propose PurifyGen, an effective solution for safe
text-to-image generation that requires neither model retraining
nor additional data. By leveraging dual-space semantic transfor-
mations, it ensures both the removal of harmful content and the
preservation of prompt intent. Its token-wise purification strategy
minimizes collateral degradation of safe information. Experimental
results demonstrate its strong generalization and superior safety
performance across diverse benchmarks. Moreover, PurifyGen is
compatible with a wide range of diffusion backbones, making it
a practical and scalable choice for real-world deployment. Future
work will explore extending this purification framework to multi-
modal generation tasks and interactive prompt refinement.
