ABSTRACT In this work, we report evidence suggesting the potential future detection of a month-scale quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) in the gamma-ray light curve of OP 313. We analysed almost 16.8 years of Fermi -LAT gamma-ray data and applied the Bayesian block method to the monthly-binned light curve. We identified four high-flux states and investigated the possibility of a QPO in the fourth high-flux state (MJD 59482–60832). Using the Weighted Wavelet Z-transform (WWZ) and Lomb–Scargle Periodogram (LSP) methods, we find tentative evidence for a month-scale QPO; however, its detection significance is limited by the small number of observed cycles. With a sufficiently long data set, the QPO may be detected with higher significance in the future. We further explored possible physical origins of this potential QPO and examined several models. We found that a curved-jet model can explain the observed behaviour.

1. INTRODUCTION Blazars are a subclass of radio-loud (RL) active galactic nuclei (AGN) powered by supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with masses ranging from 10 6 − 10 10 M⊙

(M. J. Rees 1984). They emit bipolar relativistic jets perpendicular to the accretion disk (AD) or along the polar direction, with one jet aligned closely ( ≤10 ◦) to the observer’s line of sight (C. M. Urry & P. Padovani 1995), producing strongly Doppler-boosted, non-thermal emission spanning the entire electromagnetic (EM) spectrum from radio to gamma-rays. Blazars are divided into Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQs), which show strong emission lines in their composite Optical/UV spectra, and BL Lacertae objects (BL Lacs), which exhibit weak or the absence of spectral features. Their emission shows high and rapid vari-ability in flux on timescales ranging from minutes (F. Aharonian et al. 2007) to years (C. M. Raiteri et al. 2013). The broadband spectral energy distributions (SED) of blazars exhibits a characteristic double-hump

profile (G. Fossati et al. 1998): the low-energy hump (optical to X-ray) is attributed to synchrotron radiation from relativistic leptons in the jet, while the high-energy hump in (GeV/TeV) gamma-rays is attributed to various leptonic and/or hadronic based emission processes (J. G. Kirk et al. 1998; A. M¨ ucke et al. 2003; H. Krawczynski 2004; M. B¨ ottcher et al. 2013). Periodic and quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) are common in X-ray binaries but rare in AGNs (R. A. Remillard & J. E. McClintock 2006; M. Gierli´ nski et al. 2008; A. C. Gupta 2014). Blazar variability is categorised into three timescales: (i) Intra-Day vari-ability (IDV), (ii) Short-Term variability (STV), and (iii) Long-Term variability (LTV). Gamma-ray QPOs in AGNs indicate stable processes beyond stochastic variability, shedding light on jet dynamics and accretion across black hole mass scales. IDV-QPOs are typically linked to accretion disk fluctuations, while STV and LTV QPOs are more often attributed to jet-related processes (e.g. P. Lachowicz et al. 2009; A. Sarkar et al. 2020; S. G. Jorstad et al. 2022; R. Prince et al. 2023, and references therein). In some cases, such as OJ

2287, year-scale periodicities are associated with binary SMBH systems (A. Sillanpaa et al. 1988, 1996; M. J. Valtonen et al. 2008a). Since the launch of the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (FGST) in 2008, the number of reported QPOs in AGNs has risen notably, supported by improved temporal coverage from multiwavelength campaigns (A. K. Das et al. 2023). Early detections were limited to a few sources (A. Sillanpaa et al. 1988; P. Lachowicz et al. 2009), but subsequent studies have reported QPO-like features across a broad range of energy bands (e.g M. Ackermann et al. 2015a; O. G. King et al. 2013; M. J. Graham et al. 2015; P.-F. Zhang et al. 2017; A. C. Gupta et al. 2019; J. Zhou et al. 2018; S. G. Jorstad et al. 2022; A. Sarkar et al. 2020; A. Roy et al. 2022; R. Prince et al. 2023; S. Kishore et al. 2023, and references therein). Systematic searches have also been carried out to identify QPO candidates in gamma-ray light curves (H. X. Ren et al. 2023; G. Bhatta & N. Dhital 2020). However, some studies caution that many of these QPO claims may result from red noise rather than genuine periodicity (S. Covino et al. 2019). OP 313, also catalogued as B2 1308+326 and 4FGL J1310.5+3221, is a flat-spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ) located at a redshift of 0.997 (D. P. Schneider et al. 2010) with RA= 197.619 ◦ & DEC= +32.3455 ◦, (J2000; K. J. Johnston et al. (1995)), placing it among the most distant known blazars (I. Liodakis et al. 2018). The source was first identified as a prominent radio emitter in the Bologna B2 survey (G. Colla et al. 1970), and was later classified as a blazar based on its flat radio spectrum, high optical polarization, and multiwavelength variability— features indicative of non-thermal emission from a relativistic jet closely aligned with the observer’s line of sight (M. Stickel et al. 1991). Over the years, this source has been monitored in major gamma-ray catalogues, including the Fermi -LAT 4FGL (S. Abdollahi et al. 2020), and has shown variable emission in the radio, optical, and X-ray bands (P. N. N. Mohammed et al. 2025). OP 313 entered a flaring phase in late 2023. In December, the CTA’s LST-1 prototype detected very high-energy gamma rays from the source (J. Otero-Santos et al. 2024), making it the most distant blazar observed at such energies. This detection triggered extensive multiwavelength follow-up observations, and by early 2025, OP 313 was found to be in an extremely active state across the spectrum, with Fermi -LAT, MAGIC, Swift-XRT, and optical telescopes ( INAF 2025). In the investigation into whether the blazar OP 313 is a changing-look blazar, A. Pandey et al. (2025) found that it is actually an intrinsic FSRQ that appears as a BL Lac in high-flux states due to en-hanced nonthermal emission. On May 14, coordinated optical monitoring recorded an R-band magnitude of 13.05, close to its historical maximum (A. Marchini et al. 2025). In a recent paper, multiband optical flux and spectral variability of the blazar OP 313 on IDV and STV timescales were reported during its outburst in 2024-2025 (P. U. Devanand et al. 2025). Radio observations revealed quasi-periodic polarisation (Y. Yuan 2011), while separate analyses suggested a roughly seven-year jet precession, likely driven by binary black hole dynamics (S. J. Qian et al. 2017). Additionally, VLBI astrometry spanning approximately 40 years detected an eight-year positional wobble, providing further evidence for jet precession or a binary supermassive black hole system (V. V. Makarov et al. 2024). Although previous studies have explored QPOs in the radio and polarisation domains, no dedicated search has been conducted in the gamma-ray regime. Given OP 313’s exceptional variability, high luminosity, and extensive long-term monitoring, it stands out as a com-pelling candidate for investigating high-energy QPOs. We analysed ∼16.8 years of Fermi -LAT gamma-ray data of OP 313, covering the period from August 4, 2008, to June 6, 2025. Using the Bayesian block method (J. D. Scargle et al. 2013), we identified four major flaring states, Flare-A, B, C, and D (Fig. 1). Our analysis focused on Flare-D due to evidence of a potential QPO. By examining the Flare-D light curve with futher shorter time bins (10, 7, 5, and 1 day; Fig. 2), we tentatively observed, for the first time, an approximately 83-day periodicity in the gamma-ray emission from OP 313. The paper is structured as follows: section 2 out-lines the Fermi -LAT data acquisition procedures and analysis methodology; section 3 presents the Fermi -LAT gamma-ray light curve and identifies flaring episodes; section 4 details the search for QPOs and the corresponding results; section 5 discusses the physical implications of the findings and summarizes the outcomes.

FERMI -LAT DATA ACQUISITION The Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (FGST), formerly known as Gamma-ray Large Area Space 3Telescope (GLAST), was launched into near-earth orbit on 11 th June 2008. It carries two instruments on board: one is the Large Area Telescope (LAT), and the other is the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM). The LAT is Fermi’s primary instrument, which is usually called by 

Fermi -LAT. Fermi -LAT is an imaging, pair-conversion, wide-field-of-view, high-energy gamma-ray telescope that can detect photons of energy 20 MeV to more than 300 GeV with a field of view of 2.7 sr at 1 GeV and above (W. B. Atwood et al. 2009). Due to its field of view, Fermi -LAT can observe approximately 20% of the sky at any given moment. In survey mode, it covers the whole sky in two orbits around the Earth (Fermi’s or-bital period is ∼96 minutes), which takes about 3 hours. The Pass 8 Fermi -LAT gamma-ray data for OP 313 were retrieved from the Fermi Science Support Centre (FSSC) data server ( Fermi Science Support Center 2025), covering more than 16.8 years (4 th 

August 2008 to 6 th June 2025). Data were extracted within a circular region of interest with a radius of 30 ◦

centered on OP 313, in the energy range from 100 MeV to 500 GeV. The dataset was processed and analysed using Fermipy (v1.0.1; M. Wood et al. (2017)), an open-source Python package specifically designed for Fermi -LAT data analysis. A 10 ◦×10 ◦ square analysis region was defined using the ‘roiwidth’ parameter in Fermipy’s config-uration file, following standard practices outlined in Fermipy’s documentation 1. The analysis was restricted to photon energies between 100 MeV and 500 GeV, and events with zenith angles exceeding 90 ◦ were excluded to minimise contamination from Earth limb photons. In the case of event selection, the ‘P8R3 SOURCE’ event class (evclass=128) was chosen, as recommended for analyses involving relatively small region of in-terest ( < 25 ◦) (P. Bruel et al. 2018). The evtype parameter was set to 3, encompassing all event types (both front and back sections of the tracker). Additionally, data quality cuts were applied using 

DATA QUAL > 0 && LAT CONFIG == 1 to ensure inclu-sion of only high-quality data, acquired under standard LAT science operations. For source modelling, the Fermi -LAT Fourth Source Catalogue Data Release 4 (4FGL-DR4; gll psc v35.fits) (J. Ballet et al. 2024) was incorporated. The Galactic

diffuse emission was modelled using the latest tem-plate gll iem v07 (F. Acero et al. 2016), while the isotropic extragalactic background was modelled with iso p8r3 source v2 v1.txt. We kept the parameters of the source 4FGL J1310.5+3221, the isotropic diffuse (isodiff) component, and the galactic diffuse (galdiff) component free within the region of interest (ROI). Specifically, the normalisation (norm) parameters were freed for the diffuse components, while for 4FGL J1310.5+3221, modelled by a log-parabola, the normal-isation (norm), spectral index (alpha), and curvature (beta) parameters were freed. We then performed the fit using gta.fit() with the NEWMINUIT optimiser, iterating until the fit quality reached 3; the optimiser returned the best-fit model. Subsequently, following the Fermipy user documentation ( Fermipy Collaboration 2016), the Fermi -LAT gamma-ray light curve for OP 313 was extracted. The resulting 30-day binned Fermi -LAT gamma-ray light curve is shown in the top panel of Fig. 1.

FERMI -LAT LIGHTCURVE As mentioned in Section 2, we analysed the Fermi -LAT gamma-ray light curve spanning 16.8 years, from 4 th Au-gust 2008 to 6 th June 2025 (MJD 54682.65–60832.00). The light curve, shown in the upper panel of Fig. 1, is binned in 30-day intervals. The average/ mean gamma-ray flux over the entire period is indicated by a horizontal black-dashed line in the upper panel. To identify the intervals of enhanced emission, we applied the Bayesian block method (J. D. Scargle et al. 2013) to the light curve (depicted as a black solid line in the upper panel of Fig. 1). A ‘flare’ state is defined as any period during which the gamma-ray flux rises above the mean level. The start and end times of each flare were determined based on the rising and falling segments of the Bayesian block structure along the time axis. This analysis revealed four distinct flaring episodes, labelled Flare-A, Flare-B, Flare-C, and Flare-D, and marked in the figure (Fig. 1) using vertical coloured bars in blue, green, orange, and yellow, re-spectively. These flares are also identified as regions A, B, C, and D in Fig. 1. This source has recently shown a significantly elevated gamma-ray flux (F. Casaburo et al. 2025; P. V. v. Zyl & P. Monti-Guarnieri 2025). Additionally, the detection significance of each time bin is represented using the Test Statistic (TS) values: data points with TS <25 are shown in red in Fig. 1, while those with TS ≥25 are shown in green. Notably, all data points during the flaring periods have TS ≥25, 42009 2012 2014 2017 2020 2023

indicating strong detection significance throughout the flare events. In Table 1, we present the period and average gamma-ray flux of each flare, calculated from 30-day binned 

Fermi -LAT gamma-ray data. Smaller time bins in the light curve reveal finer sub-structures (S. K. Mondal et al. 2021), which can provide valuable insights for our study. Therefore, we further analysed the Fermi -LAT gamma-ray light curve of Flare-D using smaller time bins of 10 days, 7 days, 5 days, and 1 day over the same period, following the same method. The multi-binned light curves are shown in Fig. 2. These bin sizes were not chosen arbitrarily; smaller bins reveal more details of the light curve. As can be seen in Fig. 2, the struc-tures become more prominent with decreasing bin size. However, flux errors increase as the bin size decreases. Bins smaller than 1 day were not considered because the error bars were already large. We used the 1-day binned Fermi -LAT gamma-ray light curve to investigate the presence of QPOs. Details of the QPO analysis and findings are discussed in the following section (section 4). 52022 2022 2023 2023 2024 2024 2025

Fermi-LAT gamma-ray Light Curves of OP 313 (Different Binning Intervals)

Visual inspection of the 1-day binned light curve of the source reveals notable fluctuations post MJD 59600 and appears to have a roughly periodic interval, suggesting a QPO feature. One of the most robust techniques for inspecting any prominent periodicity features in a time-series is the weighted wavelet-z analysis. This approach has the ability to detect the oscillatory features in the time series along with the time of onset, dislodging, or any evolution of the frequency with time (if the feature is transient). The method relies on the localised wavelets of a mixture of multiple temporal frequencies that dis-sociates the time series to provide a two-dimensional map of power over frequency and time (or the scale and location, see G. Foster 1996; M. Templeton 2004, and references therein). The map is computed via convolu-tion of these wavelets and the lightcurve, and is given as (see G. Foster 1996) 

W [τ, ω ; X(t)] = ω1/2

Z

X(t) Y ∗(ω(t − τ )) dt (1) where X(t), ω, τ and Y ∗ represent, respectively, the time series data, test frequency, location of the wavelet, and the complex conjugate of the wavelet function. To compute the map, we have utilised the publicly available Python package libwwz 2. The 2-D

map obtained is helpful in grasping an overview of the time-frequency dependence of the time series, which can be further utilised to constrain the portions in it that visually appear to be peculiar. Another benefit of using this 2-D map is that it can be integrated along the time axis to get an average dependence of the time series on frequency over the time span. Any signature of the periodicity would then be reflected as a peak/ hump in this averaged periodogram (the so-called time-averaged periodogram (TAP)) that gives a prior idea of the peculiar periodicity and that can be tested further via other available statistical approaches. The extreme flexibility of this method lies in the wavelets as any function (or mixture of functions) can

be utilized as the ‘Mother wavelet’ to compute the transform and the scales of few particular wavelets can be implicated to the sinusoidal frequency via analytical equations (see G. Foster 1996) frequencies, leading to their explicit utilizations. We have used ‘Morlet wavelet’ (a combination of sinusoidal waveform and a Gaussian window function given as Y (z) ∼ eiz e−cz 2

; equality is dropped to offer room for additional subdominant factors for proper normalization, if required) as the ‘Mother wavelet’, presenting the obtained 2-D map (for the portion ‘D’ highlighted in Fig. 1) in Fig. 3 and the TAP from this map in Fig. 4 for comparison, showing agreement with other independent statistical tools. In Fig. 3, we also overplotted a mildly shaded region under white dashed curves, which simply describes the edge effects on different frequencies due to the finiteness of the light curve. This shaded portion is called the region of influence, and though the features detected in such regions are real, the powers estimated in this region are prone to be affected due to finiteness of the light curve near the edges; hence, and a strong claim for a strong QPO could only be made if any feature resides outside the ROI, having enough number of cycles of oscillation. The WWZ map (Fig. 3) of the light curve shows a strongly discerning feature that is persistent from MJD ∼59600 to up to MJD ∼60500, contributing to a TAP peak at ∼0.012 d −1 (in Fig. 4). At the epochs in the map when this feature offers maximum powers, it is also associated with some higher frequency features, which, on visual inspection, hint at being probably the higher order harmonics of the main feature. At the end of epochs, the map displays a huge concentration 7of powers smeared over a wide range of frequencies, though residing only in the ROI. These features are attributed to the extreme flare/ variability events, as can be seen from the light curve itself. 4.2. Generalised Lomb Scargle Periodogram (GLSP) 

The Fourier transform is one of the efficient techniques to discern any periodic component in a time-series data. Based on the transform, the generalised Lomb-Scargle periodogram (see M. Zechmeister & M. K¨ urster 2009, and references therein) is widely utilised for periodicity searches and power spectral density (PSD or peri-odogram) analysis of unevenly sampled time series, and is equivalent to fitting a sinusoidal function of the form 

Y = a cos ωt + b sin ωt + c.The WWZ map shows a strong feature between the epochs MJD 59600 and MJD 60500. There-fore, we segmented the complete light curve between these epochs to compute GLSP, minimizing the con-tribution from non-periodic components and better estimate the significance of dominant GLSP peak in the periodogram. The GLSP power is given as follows. 

P (ω) = 12σ2 [cosine term + sine term] , (2) where cosine and sine terms are given as cosine term =

cos (2 ωtj) . (5) The blazar light curve is well known to show a red noise PSD assisted with a flattening nature at the lower and white noise at higher ends (e.g., see S. Vaughan 2010). We tested the fitting of the estimated periodogram of the segmented light curve with a simple power law model ( P (ω) = Aω α + c) and a bending power law model ( P (ν) = Aν −al /(1 + ( ν/ν b)ah−al ) + c). We found that the inspected light curve preferred the bending power law. Table 2 includes the obtained bending power law fitting parameters. The corresponding uncertainties on the parameters have been obtained following O. Gonz´ alez-Mart´ ın & S. Vaughan (2012). To estimate the significance of the peculiar fea-ture at ∼ 0.012 d −1, we followed D. Emmanoulopoulos et al. (2013) to simulate 10 5 light curve based on the PSD and probability distribution function of the input light curves. The mean of the PSDs of the 10 5 simulated light curves gives the average spectrum. Fig. 4 depicts the GLSP (or the PSD) along with the obtained average spectrum and the TAP obtained from the WWZ map. We also plot 99.0 percentile significance level utilizing the 10 5 PSDs. We found that the peak at 0 .012 d −1

barely touches the shown 99% level and hence can’t be strongly considered as a QPO feature. The only positive thing (demanding this feature a genuine one) is the agreement of additional high frequency GLSP peaks almost exactly positioned near the corresponding TAP peaks and acting as the higher order harmonics of the one at 0 .012 d −1.4.3. REDFIT analysis 

Over the past, multiple attempts have been made to assess the blazar light curves. In this regard, they have often been explained via different versions of multi-order regression methods such as ARMA, ARFIMA, CARFIMA (e.g., M. Tarnopolski et al. 2020, , and references therin), CARMA (e.g., A. Goyal et al. 2018; S. Kishore et al. 2024), with the simplest one: AR(1), utilised most often. The REDFIT software (M. Schulz & M. Mudelsee 2002), a FORTRAN-based package, allows one to assess time series data with the simplest auto-regressive (AR(1)) approach and is efficient in comprehending the red-noise power spectra and to differentiate any genuine periodic feature against multiple significance levels. It also has the ability to account for bias due to uneven sampling in data series. We have utilised this package as another of the complementary tools to check the significance of the feature detected with previous WWZ and LSP methods. The AR(1) approach fits the time series with the function 

Y (ti) = σiY (ti−1) + ϵ(ti) (6) 

σi = exp (−(ti − ti−1)/τ ) (7) where Y (ti) is the flux at the i th timestamp, σ and τ are the two AR(1) parameters, ϵ is the white noise which has zero mean and variance given as 1 − exp (−2( ti −

ti−1)/τ ). Following , the power spectrum estimated with the obtained parameters is given as

χ2 distribution with two degrees of freedom) are then estimated by multiplying the spectra by a factor −ln( α)(see eq. 15 of S. Vaughan 2005, and related texts for details). We employed this REDFIT package and present the results in Fig. 5. Another feature of this package is that it also estimates significance levels using percentiles of ensembles using Monte-Carlo simulations. It has also been incorporated in our analysis and has been included in Fig. 5. With this method, we also found that the feature under inspection can only marginally touch the 99% significance level.

DISCUSSION The PSD of the selected portion of the blazar light curve follows a bending power law, much differing from the typical simple power law. Also, it shows a high power law index above the bending frequency (in the range of ∼ 4), untypical for blazars, hinting a complexity of the emission process/mechanism. Although the feature (expected to be a QPO) is found to have low significance, we do note that there is a consistent diminution of the maximum flux values at almost regularly perceivable peaks in the light curve. This can substantially decrease the significance of the feature. The regular diminishing is easily explicable as a result of an increase in the viewing angle of the Doppler-boosted emitting region. The presence of higher order harmonics (seen in the WWZ map, TAP, and GLSP) also supports the idea that the observed feature might be a genuine QPO. With the current observation period, the limited number of observed cycles reduces the detection significance of the QPO. A longer monitoring baseline in the future would allow more cycles to be sampled, thereby strengthening the periodic signal if the QPO truly exists. Given the present indications, this appears likely and can be robustly confirmed with future observations. Currently, there are several physical models that can explain the periodic or quasi-periodic behaviour of blazar light curves. In the following part, we have discussed them in brief, 

• Binary SMBH AGN System: This model can ex-plain year-long QPOs in a binary SMBH AGN sys-tem with a total black hole mass of ∼ 10 8M⊙ and a binary separation on the milli-parsec scale, lead-ing to orbital periods of several years. In such a scenario, the secondary black hole periodically crosses the accretion disk of the primary during its orbit (see Fig. 6 of E. V. Seifina (2024) and Fig. 2 of M. J. Valtonen et al. (2025)), perturbing the accretion flow and giving rise to quasi-periodic variability (M. J. Valtonen et al. 2008b). This model has been explicitly proposed for the blazar OJ 287, which hosts a massive binary SMBH sys-tem with an orbital period of ∼12 years (M. J. Valtonen et al. 2008b). Several year-long QPOs in the gamma-ray band have been interpreted within this framework (M. Ackermann et al. 2015b; A. Sandrinelli et al. 2016a,b, 2017; P. Zhang et al. 2017; P.-F. Zhang et al. 2017; A. Sandrinelli et al. 2018). 

• Rotation of the accretion disk hot-spot or spiral shocks or some other non-axisymmetric phenom-ena around the innermost region of the accretion disk: The emission from an accretion disk hotspot orbiting close to the innermost stable circular or-bit (ISCO) of the SMBH is quasi-thermal. It can account for the observed optical flux modulation. Such optical variability may, in turn, modulate the seed photon field for the external Compton (EC) process in the jet, giving rise to corresponding flux variations in the gamma-ray band (A. C. Gupta et al. 2017). The orbital period of the hotspot is related to the central black hole mass through the following equation 

MM⊙

= 3.23 × 10 4P

(r3/2 + a)(1 + z) (9) where P is the orbital period in seconds and z is the redshift of the source. For a Schwarzschild black hole ( r = 6 .0, a = 0) and a maximally ro-tating Kerr black hole ( r = 1 .2, a = 0 .9982; A. C. Gupta et al. (2009)), the observed ∼83-day pe-riod implies SMBH masses of 7 .2 × 10 9M⊙ and 95.0 × 10 10 M⊙, respectively. No previous study was found that directly measured the black hole mass of OP 313. Usually, the black hole mass of an FSRQ is considered to be within the range of 10 8-10 9M⊙. The first value is already very large, and the second exceeds all other SMBH mass es-timates. Since the required black hole masses are unreasonably high, it is unlikely that the observed variability feature originates from a hotspot orbit-ing near the ISCO. In addition, this scenario faces two further chal-lenges: (1) from J. M. Bardeen et al. (1972) we can found that for any realistic SMBH mass and spin, the orbital period at the ISCO is typically much shorter ( ∼hour scale for any black hole of mass of 10 8-10 9M⊙) than the observed timescale, and (2) the gamma-ray modulation would not exactly match the optical one, since relativistic Doppler boosting alters the observed period in the jet. An-other possibility is jet precession, which can gener-ate QPOs in blazar light curves, but the expected timescale is typically longer than a year (F. M. Rieger 2004), inconsistent with the ∼83-day QPO. 

• L. Dong et al. (2020) proposed that QPO might originate from kink instability on a timescale of weeks to months in the jet spine. However, an anti-correlation between the optical polarization degree and the flux was found. Currently, due to the lack of well-sampled optical polarization de-gree data, this scenario cannot be verified. 

• A. P. Marscher et al. (1992) showed that transient QPOs can also arise from a strong turbulent flow occurring behind a propagating shock or a stand-ing shock. In the post-shock plasma, turbulent eddies form and play a major role in periodically changing the Doppler factor due to their rotation. In our study, the turnover period is ∼1126 days (considering the Doppler factor during the flare state of OP 313 to be 27 (S. Britzen et al. 2017)). This suggests the presence of very large eddies, which is required to explain the observed QPO; on top of that, these structures are random and short-lived to produce the QPO that would not persist for many cycles (P. J. Wiita 2011). 

• OP 313 is an FSRQ-type blazar, whose emission is jet-dominated. So it is highly likely that the QPO is connected to the jet emission. In a binary SMBH system (M. J. Valtonen et al. 2008b; M. J. Graham et al. 2015), the presence of a secondary SMBH leads to jet precession, which can be at-

tributed to the variation of Lorentz factor along the line of sight of the observer. This is another possible reason for the observed QPO in blazars. According to P. C. Fragile & D. L. Meier (2009), the Lense-Thirring precession of the disk can in-fluence the jet orientation, which generates QPO of period ∼1-2 years (F. M. Rieger 2007), which in this case is much higher than the observered QPO of OP 313. 

• Jet-induced quasi-periodicity could also be caused due to the motion of the plasma blob following the internal helical structure of the blazar jet (Fig. 6). As the blob moves along the helical structure, the viewing angle between the blob and the observer’s line of sight changes over time, which causes vari-ations in the Doppler factor (P. Mohan & A. Mangalam 2015) and leads to day-to-month-scale quasi-periodicity. The gamma-ray QPO observed for OP 313 is found to be within this range. The gamma-ray can be produced within the spherical blob or emission re-gion through inverse-Compton (IC) process; via synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) and/ or external Compton (EC) processes. In Fig. 6, we have shown a schematic diagram of the curved-jet model, where the spherical blob moves along the helical path (blue dashed line) within the blazar jet (not to scale). The curved 10 jet has launched from the base of the SMBH. The SMBH and accretion disk around the SMBH have also been shown in the diagram. The blob moves outward, i.e., upward in this picture, along the he-lical path. The angle between the blob velocity vector and the jet axis is ϕ, also called pitch an-gle, the angle between the observer’s line of sight and the jet axis is ψ, and the angle between the blob velocity vector and the observer’s line of sight is θ.In the case of blazars, the viewing angle of the blob with respect to the observer’s line of sight is so small that the observed emission is strongly boosted by relativistic Doppler beaming, which is quantified the the following equation, 

δ = 1Γ(1 − β cos θ) (10) where δ is the Doppler factor, Γ is the bulk Lorentz factor, β is the ratio of the bulk velocity of the plasma to the velocity of light in vacuum, and θ is the angle between the observer’s line of sight and the direction of motion of the blob. In the case of straight-jet model, the angle be-tween the observer’s line of sight and the jet axis remains the same over time, and due to the heli-cal motion of the blob, the viewing angle of the blob with respect to the observer changes, lead-ing to the change in the Doppler factor with time. This causes the periodic fluctuation in the ob-served gamma-ray flux of blazars (Fig. 7a). But, as can be seen in Fig. 7a, this model is not able to explain the observed gamma-ray flux variation, so we checked whether the curved-jet model can ex-plain the observed gamma-ray lightcurve or not. In the case of the curved-jet model, besides the helical motion of the blob within the blazar jet, the jet is also curved, i.e., the angle between the observer’s line of sight and the jet axis changes. The combined effect of these two results not only the periodic fluctuation of the gamma-ray flux but also the amplitude modulation of the observed flux (Fig. 7b). Mathematically, θ changes with time in the following manner, given by E. Sobacchi et al. (2017); J. Zhou et al. (2018): cos θ(t) = cos ϕ cos ψ + sin ψ sin ϕ cos

following the previous studies by J. Zhou et al. (2018); A. Sarkar et al. (2020); R. Prince et al. (2023); P. Penil et al. (2025). S. Britzen et al. (2017) reported the Lorentz factor (Γ=16.2 ±4.4), median Doppler factor ( ¯δ=27 ±7) of OP 313 using 19 years (1995-2014) of Very Long Baseline Ar-ray (VLBA) monitoring data from the MOJAVE survey. Z. R. Weaver et al. (2022) studied the parsec-scale jet kinematics of a sample of gamma-ray bright blazars monitored over 10 years (2007 June- 2018 December) with the VLBA at 43 GHz under the VLBA-BUBLAZAR program and calcu-lated different physical parameters, e.g., Doppler factor, Lorentz factor. OP 313 or B2 1308+326 is also one of the monitored sources. They quoted the Lorentz factor Γ= 14.6 ±0.7 and Doppler fac-tor δ= 18.5 ±2.9 for this source. Also, A. Pandey et al. (2024) found that during the low-state the Doppler factor of this source is ∼15, which in-creases to ∼27 during the flare state. Our study is focused on the flaring state of this source, so in this work we considered δ ∼27 and Γ=16.2. We then estimated β using the expression Γ = 1√1−β2 ,which was found to be 0.9981, and the QPO period in the blob frame (P ′) is found to be 42.9 years. Inside the jet, the blob travels 13.09 pc in one cy-cle. We compute this distance using the formula D=c βP′ cos ϕ.We then simulated the observed flux considering the following mathematical relation, 

Fγ ∝ δα (12) where, F γ is the observed gamma-ray flux, α is considered to be 4 (C. D. Dermer & G. Menon 2009) as this approximation is majorly considered while studying the blazar emission. We replaced 

δ in Eqn 12 by Eqn. 10, and lastly, replaced the cosine function with Eqn. 11. In this case, we consider a linear change of the jet viewing an-gle with respect to the observer, and following previous literature by J. Zhou et al. (2018); A. Sarkar et al. (2020); R. Prince et al. (2023); P. Penil et al. (2025), we bounded the range of the angle. Then we modelled the observed lightcurve using this model. We used the Akaike information criterion (AIC) to find out the best-fit model statistically, and we found that for the straight-jet model, the AIC value is higher compared to the curved-jet model. Eventually, it can be said that the curved-jet 11
