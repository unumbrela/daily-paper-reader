Abstract 

Chain-of-Thought reasoning has significantly enhanced the problem-solving capabilities of Large Language Models. Unfortunately, current models generate reasoning steps se-quentially without foresight, often becoming trapped in suboptimal reasoning paths with redundant steps. In contrast, we introduce Neural Chain-of-Thought Search (NCoTS), a framework that reformulates reasoning as a dy-namic search for the optimal thinking strategy. By quantitatively characterizing the solution space, we reveal the existence of sparse supe-rior reasoning paths that are simultaneously more accurate and concise than standard out-puts. Our method actively navigates towards these paths by evaluating candidate reasoning operators using a dual-factor heuristic that opti-mizes for both correctness and computational cost. Consequently, NCoTS achieves a Pareto improvement across diverse reasoning bench-marks, boosting accuracy by over 3.5% while reducing generation length by over 22% . Our code and data are available on Github. 

1 Introduction 

Large Language Models (LLMs) have evolved into specialized Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) (Ope-nAI et al., 2024; DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025; Chen et al., 2025b; Li et al., 2025i; Xu et al., 2025a) that excel at complex tasks through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning (Wei et al., 2023; Kojima et al., 2022). These models achieved state-of-the-art per-formance on math, logic, and programming bench-marks (Zhang et al., 2025d; Snell et al., 2025). However, recent research indicates that Large Rea-soning Models suffer from a strategic bottleneck at reasoning path planning (Shojaee et al., 2025; Liu et al., 2025e; Sui et al., 2025; An et al., 2025; Jiang et al., 2025a). They frequently fail to foresee the optimal reasoning direction, causing them to drift into inefficient patterns (Kang et al., 2025). For instance, they may frequently output reflective (a) Traditional CoT : Sequential Reasoning Without Foresight

tokens like "Wait" or "Hmm", triggering unneces-sary verification steps or getting stuck in excessive branch exploration(Wang et al., 2025a; Jiang et al., 2025a; Yang et al., 2025b). This behavior suggests a lack of foresight in navigating the reasoning path. We investigate this bottleneck through a hybrid guidance experiment (Detailed in Appendix A.1). We employed a larger model to generate only the initial token at each reasoning step for a smaller model. These guiding tokens accounted for only 

2.9% of the total output but yielded an average ac-curacy gain of 6.2% across benchmarks (Fig. 1). This result confirms that the core limitation of rea-soning models lies in their inability to strategically navigate reasoning paths at critical decision points. 1

Based on these insights, we propose treating reasoning generation as a dynamic search prob-lem. To validate the potential of this paradigm, we quantitatively characterize the reasoning solu-tion space in Section 3.3. This analysis reveals the existence of superior reasoning paths that achieve higher accuracy and lower generation length than standard model outputs. These optimal paths are sparse and difficult to locate via standard sampling, which necessitates a targeted search mechanism to identify them efficiently. To this end, we intro-duce Neural Chain-of-Thought Search (NCoTS) in Section 2. This framework models reasoning as a search for the optimal sequence of reasoning oper-ators. At each decision point, the model evaluates potential directions using a dual-factor heuristic that estimates both correctness and efficiency. As demonstrated in Section 3, our method actively dis-covers superior reasoning paths that outperform baselines in both accuracy and efficiency with neg-ligible overhead. We provide a deeper analysis of the proposed framework in Section 4. We show the related works in Appendix C, and summarize the contributions of this paper as follows: 1. We identify the reasoning path planning bot-tleneck in current reasoning models. Our hybrid guidance experiment reveals that correcting sparse thinking tokens, comprising only 2.9% of the out-put, yields an average accuracy gain of 6.2% .2. We provide the first quantitative analysis of the reasoning solution space, confirming the exis-tence of superior paths that simultaneously achieve higher accuracy and reduced generation cost. 3. We propose Neural Chain-of-Thought Search, a framework that actively searches how to think to discover superior reasoning paths. By employing a dual-factor heuristic to optimize both correctness and conciseness, our method consistently achieves the highest efficiency metric across all settings, im-proving average accuracy by over 3.5% while re-ducing generation length by over 22% .

2 Method 

We propose Neural Chain-of-Thought Search, a framework that reformulates the generative rea-soning process as a dynamic search for the opti-mal reasoning path. To simultaneously maximize performance and minimize reasoning length, our method explicitly navigates the solution space by evaluating how to think at critical decision points. 

2.1 Preliminary 

We formalize Chain-of-Thought reasoning as a se-quential decision process. Let x denote the input query. The reasoning chain y consists of a sequence of T discrete steps y = ( s1, s 2, . . . , s T ). Each step 

st constitutes a complete semantic unit such as a deduction or calculation. Following prior work (Yang et al., 2025d), we mark the completion of a step with a specific delimiter token "\n\n" . (See Appendix E.1 for empirical evidence). We identify the locations of these delimiters as Decision Points. At a given decision point 

t, the model tends to output a thinking token (Qian et al., 2025) to indicate the logical direc-tion of the subsequent step st+1 . For instance, the model might generate "wait" to initiate reflec-tion or "alternatively" to explore other possibili-ties. We formulate these thinking tokens as Rea-soning Operators ot drawn from a action space 

O. We define O as a finite and small set of think-ing tokens which allows for efficient enumeration: 

O = {"Wait" , "So" , "Then" , ... }. The sequence of operators α = ( o1, o 2, . . . , o T ) defines the high-level structure which we term the Reasoning Ar-chitecture. Our objective is to find the optimal ar-chitecture α∗ for a query that maximizes accuracy while minimizing the total sequence length. 

2.2 Overview: Search How to Think Intuition. Existing large reasoning models typ-ically execute reasoning sequentially. Upon com-pleting a step, they immediately generate the sub-sequent step, often lacking high-level planning. Specifically, the model commits to a specific line of reasoning without evaluating the most effective direction. This lack of foresight may trap models in suboptimal paths, leading to redundant verification loops or verbose derivations. 

Proposed Mechanism. To address this, we intro-duce a mechanism to search how to think . Fig. 2 illustrates the overview of our framework, which comprises four phases. (1) Pause Generation : The standard generation halts immediately upon de-tecting a step delimiter. (2) Lookahead Simulation :The model simulates potential reasoning directions by projecting all candidate operators from the set 

O into the future context. (3) Heuristic Evaluation :A dual-factor heuristic function assesses each di-rection by estimating its success probability and computational cost. (4) Strategic Selection : The model samples the optimal operator based on these 2Thinking Tokens

estimates and resumes generation. This active de-cision process prunes inefficient branches before they consume computational resources. 

2.3 Dual-Factor Heuristic Function 

We employ a composite heuristic function H(ht, o )

to evaluate the efficacy of applying operator o at the current hidden state ht. This function comprises two specialized estimators designed to quantify the quality and efficiency of the reasoning path. 

Path Potential Estimator. The first component is the Path Potential Estimator Hpot . It predicts the probability that a specific reasoning direction will lead to a correct solution. We implement this esti-mator as a linear projection layer taking the final hidden state as input to output logits over the oper-ator set O. As demonstrated in Section 1, Larger Models possess stronger capabilities in high-level planning. Therefore, we train this estimator via policy distillation from a fixed Teacher LRM. We treat the teacher’s probability distribution over O

as the expert policy PT . The estimator is optimized by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence: 

Lpot = Eht∼D 

h

DKL 



PT (ht) Hpot (ht)

i 

. (1) This estimator effectively transfers the strategic planning capabilities of the teacher into the search process, serving as the compass for correctness. 

Reasoning Progress Estimator. The second component is the Reasoning Progress Estimator 

Hprog . It estimates the efficiency of a reasoning path. We implement this estimator as a linear re-gression head that maps the hidden state to a scalar value representing normalized progress. Similar to recent works on reasoning monitoring (Eisenstadt et al., 2025), this estimator predicts the comple-tion ratio of the solution given the current state. We train this estimator on a token-level dense su-pervision task. For each training query, we collect multiple complete reasoning paths. Specifically, for every token at index k within a completed path of total length L, we construct a training pair (hk, l k).Here, hk denotes the hidden state and lk = k/L 

represents the ground truth normalized progress, indicating the portion of the solution completed. The estimator Hprog projects hk to a scalar value, trained by minimizing the Mean Squared Error: 

Lprog = E(hk ,l k )∼D 

h

Hprog (hk) − lk 2i

. (2) By maximizing this estimated progress, the search algorithm favors operators that significantly ad-vance the reasoning state toward the solution, ef-fectively penalizing verbose or circular steps. 

2.4 Search Algorithm 

We optimize the reasoning path by actively search-ing how to think during inference. This strategy evaluates potential reasoning directions at decision points to identify the optimal path. 

One Step Lookahead. At decision point t,marked by the delimiter "\n\n" , we proactively explore the potential future space. Let y<t denote 3the current reasoning path. For each candidate oper-ator o ∈ O , we simulate the next step by appending 

o to the KV cache of model M:

h′ 

> t,o

= M [x, y <t , o ], ∀o ∈ O . (3) This yields the lookahead hidden state h′

> t,o

.Given that the thinking token governs the think-ing mode as detailed in Section 4, this lightweight lookahead captures the semantic trajectory of the branch without the overhead of full step generation. 

Heuristic Scoring. Once the lookahead states are generated, we assign a composite score S(o) to each branch by aggregating the outputs of the dual-factor heuristics. The score integrates both the po-tential for accuracy and the efficiency of progress: 

S(o) = Hpotential (ht, o )

| {z }

> Success Potential

+λ · H progress (h′

> t,o

)

| {z }

> Efficiency Progress

. (4) Here, λ is a hyperparameter that governs the em-phasis on conciseness. A higher λ encourages the model to select more concise reasoning paths. 

Probabilistic Selection. To ensure diversity and avoid local optima, we convert these scores into a probabilistic search policy Psearch using Softmax function with a temperature parameter τ :

Psearch (o|ht) = exp ( S(o)/τ )

P 

> o′∈O

exp ( S(o′)/τ ) . (5) The final operator is selected by sampling o∗ ∼

Psearch . This procedure ensures that the selected reasoning direction is both strategically sound and computationally efficient. 

3 Experiments 

In this section, we empirically validate the pro-posed framework. We first characterize the rea-soning solution space, confirming the existence of superior paths that achieve higher accuracy and lower length than standard generation. We then demonstrate that our method actively locates these paths, consistently achieving the highest efficiency metrics ( η) across all experimental settings. 

3.1 Experimental Setup Datasets. We evaluate the performance of our method across four diverse benchmarks. The se-lected benchmarks include AMC23, ARC-C (Clark et al., 2018), GPQA (Rein et al., 2023), and GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021) which collectively cover symbolic deductive reasoning, commonsense reasoning, expert knowledge reasoning and multi-step arithmetic reasoning. We provide details of these benchmarks in Appendix A.3. 

Models. To broadly explore the characteristics of the solution space, our analysis in Section 3.3 em-ploys multiple models of varying sizes and archi-tectures: DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-{1.5B, 7B, 14B, 32B}, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025; Qwen et al., 2025; Dubey et al., 2024). For the evaluation of our search method (Section 3.4), we employ two con-figurations: a small pair, which uses {SLM=Qwen-1.5B, LLM=Qwen-7B}, and a large pair, which uses {SLM=Qwen-7B, LLM=Qwen-32B}. 

Baselines. We compare the proposed framework against six baselines. We use Mean and Original to represent the performance of standard sampling. The evaluation also includes recent strategies for optimizing reasoning efficiency such as NoWait (Wang et al., 2025a), AdaptThink (Zhang et al., 2025a), ThinkPrune (Hou et al., 2025) and Laser (Liu et al., 2025c). See Appendix A.4 for details. 

Metrics. We report task-specific Accuracy ( A)and the average token count ( L). To quantify the trade-off between performance gains and computa-tional cost, we adopt a composite Efficiency Metric (η), inspired by previous works on efficient reason-ing (An et al., 2025; Qu et al., 2025a). This metric places a quadratic emphasis on accuracy, as com-putational savings are secondary to correctness: 

η =

 Ey∼π∗ [A(y)] 

Ey0∼π[A(y0)] 

2

| {z }

> Performance Gain

· Ey0∼π[L(y0)] 

Ey∼π∗ [L(y)] 

| {z }

> Computational Savings

. (6) Here, π∗ denotes our search-augmented policy and 

π represents the original model. A(·) measures solution correctness and L(·) denotes sequence length. A value of η > 1 indicates that the method improves the reasoning density and provides more correct reasoning per unit of computation.

We con-duct a randomized search experiment to character-ize the architectural search space A and empirically map the performance boundaries of the model.

This confirms that paths with higher accuracy and lower length are attainable, validating the feasibility of our search framework. The red cross mark represents our method, demonstrating that our strategy successfully discovers these superior paths that optimize both accuracy and conciseness. 

to sample the reasoning operator ot from the uni-form distribution over O. We then aggregate these paths to construct density heatmaps on the Accu-racy versus Length plane. This visualization re-veals the distribution of potential search strategies and the theoretical limits of the model. Appendix A.2 provides more details regarding the experimen-tal setup and searching mechanism. 

Training. We initialize the potential estimator using weights from the pre-trained language head of the student model. Specifically, we extract the rows of its embedding matrix corresponding to the thinking tokens in O to preserve the model’s initial semantic priors. The progress estimator is initial-ized randomly. Training is performed on a compos-ite dataset comprising LogicQA (Liu et al., 2020), Math500 (Hendrycks et al., 2021), AIME22-25 (Balunovi´ c et al., 2025), and HumanEval (Chen et al., 2021). For the potential estimator, we employ a distillation objective. Given a query, the model generates steps until a decision point is reached. We then compute logits for the thinking tokens us-ing the fixed Teacher LLM and minimize the KL divergence between the Teacher’s distribution and the estimator’s output. The progress estimator is trained via Mean Squared Error to predict the com-plete ratio of solution, as detailed in Section 2.3. 

Testing. For all methods, we set the temperature to 0.6, top-p to 0.95 , and the global maximum token limit to 4096 . For our search method, we impose a maximum limit of 50 reasoning steps. During inference, we set the balancing hyperpa-rameter λ = 1 and sample the reasoning opera-tors based on the composite score S(o), follow-ing the search policy detailed in Section 2.4. The prompt used is: Please reason step by step, and put your final answer within \boxed{}

racy and length. This structural divergence con-firms that the high-level planning of the reasoning path is a critical determinant of the final solution quality. (2) Suboptimality of Standard Decoding. The Original baseline consistently outperforms the random Mean baseline but remains far from the theoretical performance boundary. This gap sug-gests that the model’s standard generation strat-egy fails to exploit the full intrinsic potential of the model. (3) Existence of Superior Paths. The heatmaps reveal a region in the upper-left quad-rant with higher accuracy and lower length than the original baseline. These Pareto-superior so-lutions are empirical proof that it is feasible to simultaneously optimize correctness and cost. (4) Sparsity of Superior Solutions. The region con-taining these superior paths is extremely sparse compared to the dense clusters of suboptimal paths. This sparsity explains why standard sampling fails to yield consistent improvements. The probability of randomly encountering a superior path is negli-gible, necessitating a targeted search approach. 

3.4 Efficacy of the Proposed Search Strategy 

Table 1 compares our method against base-lines across DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B. While many ex-isting baselines struggle to balance the trade-off between performance and cost, our method simul-taneously enhances accuracy and reduces compu-tational cost. On the 1.5B model, we achieve a 

4.0% accuracy gain and a 22 .3% reduction in to-ken usage. On the 7B model, NCoTS improves average accuracy by 3.5% and decreases genera-tion length by 22 .6% . Notably, on GSM8K with the 1.5B model, our approach reduces the gener-ation length by over 50% while achieving an ac-curacy gain of 2.4% . Moreover, on GSM8K with the 7B model, accuracy improves by 2.3% with a length reduction of 47% , and on AMC23 accu-racy improves substantially by 7.5% with length reduced by 12% . Our method consistently achieves the highest efficiency metric η across all settings, yielding an average η of 1.595 for the 1.5B model and 1.524 for the 7B model. This confirms that our search strategy maximizes reasoning density and effectively prunes redundant steps to deliver more correct reasoning per unit of computation. Furthermore, we observe a distinct correlation between the nature of the task and the magnitude of efficiency gains. The method excels in reasoning-intensive tasks. On GSM8K and AMC23, it achieves the highest efficiency scores between 1.5

and 2.1, as the search mechanism effectively navi-gates complex reasoning branches. In hybrid tasks like ARC-C, which require a blend of common sense and reasoning, gains remain substantial with 

η ranging from 1.3 to 1.4. On knowledge-intensive tasks such as GPQA, efficiency gains are the lowest at approximately 1.2. This is expected behavior, as performance in these domains relies more on fac-tual retrieval than strategic planning, yet the consis-tent improvement across all benchmarks validates the generalizability of our framework. 6Then The So Thus Wait Alternatively Statement Summary Reflection Divergence Figure 4: Correlation between thinking tokens and think-ing modes.

4 Further Discussion 

In this Section, We conduct a more comprehensive analysis of the proposed search framework. For more analysis, please refer to Appendix D and E. (1) How does the thinking token affect the corresponding reasoning step? In section 2, we use thinking tokens from the opera-tor set O to steer the reasoning direction at each de-cision point. To illustrate the influence of these to-kens, we analyzed a large corpus of reasoning paths generated by DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B on the AMC23 benchmark. We extracted each (op-erator, step) pair and employed DeepSeek-V3 to classify the functional purpose of the step si into one of four modes: Statement, Summary, Reflec-tion, or Divergence (see Appendix D for prompt, methodology and more results). As shown in Fig. 4, our analysis reveals a strong correspondence be-tween the chosen operator and the resulting think-ing mode. For instance, the "Wait" operator consis-tently precedes Reflection steps, whereas "Then" strongly correlates with Statement steps. Psychological studies suggest that human Sys-tem 2 reasoning involves multiple distinct modes of thinking, such as stating, summarizing, reflect-ing, and exploring (Evans, 2008; Moshman, 2014). People dynamically switch between them during complex reasoning. We argue that for LLMs to solve complex problems, they also require this abil-ity to dynamically shift their thinking mode. A key insight of our work is that thinking tokens are not just superficial prefixes, they function as a control mechanism to select the thinking mode for next step. Leveraging this insight, our method dynami-cally guides the model’s thinking modes, thereby steering the reasoning path toward a better solution. 0 2000 Token Relative Position

(2) Does the reasoning progress estimator pre-dict the progress accurately? We introduce the reasoning progress estimator 

Hprog in Section 2.3, grounded in recent evidence that the hidden states of reasoning models implic-itly encode the progress of the solution (Eisenstadt et al., 2025). Figure 5 plots the estimator’s pre-dictions against ground-truth normalized positions. The exponentially smoothed prediction trajectory aligns well with the true progress, demonstrating that a lightweight regression estimator effectively extracts this signal and estimate the remaining com-putational cost. The visible variance in the scat-ter plot reflects semantic sensitivity rather than stochastic noise. As noted in (Eisenstadt et al., 2025), reflective tokens (e.g., “Wait”, “Hmm”) in-duce drops in predicted progress, correctly signal-ing reasoning expansion, while decisive operators (e.g., “Therefore”) indicate proximity to the so-lution. In our search framework, we prioritize the capability to distinguish efficiency over exact progress prediction. The reasoning progress esti-mator need only preserve the correct preference ordering by assigning higher values to efficient operators (e.g., v“Then” > v “Wait” ). This ensures that the search algorithm correctly prioritizes more efficient branches without necessitating precise es-timation of the absolute length. (3) Is the path potential estimator or the rea-soning progress estimator necessary? To validate our dual-factor heuristic design, we conducted an ablation study by removing the po-tential and progress estimators respectively. Table 2 reports the results on the English Math Compe-tition subset of OlympiadBench (He et al., 2024). The results demonstrate that each component con-tributes to the search process in a unique and in-dispensable way. The configuration without the 7OlympiadBench Method Acc ↑ Len ↓ η ↑

> Table 2: Ablation study of the dual-factor heuristic. The results verify that both potential and progress estimators are essential for balancing correctness and conciseness.

progress estimator achieves high accuracy but fails to maximize efficiency, as the potential estimator prioritizes correctness without incentives to prune valid but redundant steps. Conversely, removing the potential estimator leads to a collapse in per-formance. It is worth noting that while this setting reduces length compared to the original baseline, it is less efficient than our full method. This occurs because the progress estimator, lacking semantic guidance, tends to select operators that disrupt the logical flow, causing the model to generate inco-herent, compensatory text in an attempt to recover. Therefore, our framework relies on the synergy between the two estimators. The potential estima-tor leverages distilled strategic priors to identify paths with high success probability. The progress estimator proactively steers the search toward the most compact reasoning paths. This combination steers the search toward reasoning paths that are simultaneously correct and concise. (4) Is the search paradigm we proposed com-patible with other methods? Our proposed search paradigm is compatible with existing methods. Since our approach operates at the decoding stage by intervening in the selec-tion of reasoning operators, it functions as a plug-and-play module that is orthogonal to model ar-chitecture modifications or sample-level routing strategies. To demonstrate this compatibility, we analyze the integration of our method with Adapt-Think (Zhang et al., 2025a). AdaptThink repre-sents a class of long/short thinking strategies that dynamically determine the inference budget based on the difficulty of the input query. The synergy is clear: AdaptThink optimizes the macro-level re-source allocation (deciding when to reason), while our method optimizes the micro-level reasoning path (steering how to reason). As shown in Table 3, the composite method achieves additive efficiency OlympiadBench Method Acc ↑ Len ↓ η ↑

gains, proving that our search effectively comple-ments budget-adaptive baselines. (5) How is the cost and latency of the dual-factor heuristic function? The overhead introduced by our dual-factor heuris-tic function is negligible in terms of both memory and latency. Regarding parameter efficiency, for the 1.5B model (hidden dimension d = 1536 ), the potential estimator ( d → |O| ) and progress estima-tor ( d → 1) collectively introduce approximately 

2.6 × 10 4 parameters. This represents a mere 

0.0017% increase, incurring negligible memory overhead. Inference latency is mitigated by sparse activation and parallel lookahead. The search mech-anism activates strictly at critical decision points, which comprise only 3% of total tokens, allow-ing the model to execute standard decoding for the remaining 97% . When activated, candidate branches share an identical prefix, enabling us to compute lookahead steps in a single parallel batch via KV caching. Ultimately, this minor cost is sur-passed by efficiency gains; our method reduces average generation length by over 22% across all benchmarks. This substantial decrease in gener-ation length yields a net reduction in aggregate computational operations. 

5 Conclusion 

In this paper, we introduce NCoTS, a framework that searches for optimal reasoning paths by dy-namically steering the thinking modes at decision points. By explicitly optimizing for correctness and conciseness with a dual-factor heuristic, NCoTS achieves a Pareto improvement, boosting accuracy by over 3.5% while reducing generation length by 

22% . Our findings demonstrate that the bottleneck of efficient reasoning lies in the myopia of next-token prediction; resolving this requires equipping models with the foresight to plan how to think .8Limitations 

We propose a search mechanism guided by a de-fined operator set. However, our current set is primarily optimized for English STEM reasoning and does not account for other languages or cre-ative tasks. Fortunately, the framework allows for straightforward extension to multilingual or cre-ative domains by recalibrating these thinking to-kens. Additionally, while our potential estima-tor relies on teacher supervision which theoreti-cally bounds the planning capability, future works could employ reinforcement learning to enable self-improved exploration beyond the teacher’s distri-bution. Furthermore, our reliance on static newline delimiters effectively captures major pauses but may be too rigid for non-standard formats, suggest-ing a need for dynamic entropy-based triggers in future works. Moreover, we employ a local looka-head strategy rather than a global search mecha-nism like MCTS. Although this limits long-horizon planning in extremely complex scenarios, it repre-sents a deliberate trade-off to simultaneously opti-mize correctness and conciseness, thereby achiev-ing efficiency gains without incurring the heavy computational overhead of exhaustive search.

Collaborative Inference Procedure  

> Thinking Token Rest of Step

Figure 6: Illustration of the Collaborative Inference Procedure. At each reasoning step delimiter (\n\n), the larger Planner model intervenes to generate a single, strategic Thinking Token (e.g., [Wait]). This token di-rects the reasoning path, while the smaller Executor model generates the detailed remainder of the step. 

To empirically validate the hypothesis that Small Reasoning Models (SRMs) suffer primarily from a lack of high-level planning rather than token-level execution, we designed a Hybrid Guidance framework. This framework decouples strategic planning from detailed execution by employing a collaborative generation process between a stronger Planner model and a weaker Executor model. 

A.1.1 Experimental Setup 

We utilize DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B as the strategic planner ( Mplan ) and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B as the executor ( Mexec ). The reasoning process is treated as a sequence of discrete steps, delimited by the token sequence "\n\n" .

A.1.2 Collaborative Inference Procedure 

As shown in Fig.6, the generation follows an it-erative handover mechanism. The process begins with the input query x. At the start of each reason-ing step (after a "\n\n" delimiter, as introduced in Section 2.1), the context is passed to the plan-ner Mplan . The planner is constrained to generate exactly one single token. This token serves as the directional guide (e.g., a logical connective or a reflective marker). Once this guiding token is gen-erated, it is appended to the context. Control is then transferred to the executor Mexec , which generates the remainder of the reasoning step until it predicts the next step delimiter "\n\n" . This cycle repeats until the final answer is derived or the maximum token length is reached. 20 Token Freq (%) Token Freq (%)

> Table 4: Frequency Distribution of Guiding Tokens gen-erated by the Planner Mplan . The distribution is heavily dominated by logical connectives (e.g., "So", "Wait"), demonstrating that the Planner provides structural guid-ance to navigate the reasoning path rather than specific content.

Performance. Despite the minimal intervention, where guiding tokens account for only 2.9% of the total generated tokens, the hybrid approach yields a substantial performance improvement. As shown in Fig.1), the 7B model achieves an average accu-racy gain of 6.2% across benchmarks when guided by the 32B model’s guiding tokens. These results suggest that SRMs possess sufficient capability for granular execution but struggle to independently navigate complex reasoning paths. 

A.1.3 Analysis of Guiding Tokens 

To examine whether Mplan injects factual knowl-edge or structural guidance, we analyzed the fre-quency distribution of the tokens generated by 

Mplan across the test set. As illustrated in Table 4, the vast majority of generated tokens are logical connectives (defined as Thinking Tokens and Rea-soning Operators in our method), such as "Wait", "So", and "Alternatively". Content-heavy nouns or entities are rarely generated during this phase. This confirms that the larger model primarily contributes to the reasoning process by steering the logical flow and correcting the reasoning path rather than pro-viding direct factual answers. 

A.2 Details of the random search experiment 

To investigate the feasibility and potential of our proposed search-based framework, we designed a randomized search experiment. The primary objec-tive of this experiment is to probe the boundaries of the solution space and determine whether there exist superior paths, which are defined as reasoning paths that achieve higher accuracy and lower com-putational cost than those produced by the model’s standard generation policy. 

A.2.1 Randomized Intervention Procedure 

We utilize a stochastic intervention mechanism to explore diverse reasoning paths. Let M denote the language model and x the input query. During the generation process, we monitor the stream for the step delimiter token sequence "\n\n" , which marks the completion of a reasoning step st−1. At this decision point, we suspend the standard sam-pling process. Instead of selecting the subsequent token from the model’s predicted distribution, we uniformly sample a reasoning operator ot from a fixed set O. Specifically, We define this set as 

O = {"The" , "Thus" , "Therefore" , "So" , "Then" ,

"Let" , "Wait" , "Alternatively" }. This operator is forced into the context context as the prefix for step st. The model M then resumes generation conditioned on this intervention. This cycle repeats until the model outputs a final answer or reaches a horizon of Tmax = 50 steps. 

A.2.2 Construction of the Solution Space 

We characterize the solution space through high-volume sampling. For each query xi in the eval-uation dataset of size N , we generate K = 16 

independent reasoning paths via the intervention procedure described above. We visualize the re-sulting performance distribution (Fig. 3) using Monte Carlo aggregation. A single data point in the density heatmap corresponds to a coordinate pair 

( ¯L, ¯A), representing the average length and aver-age accuracy over the full dataset. To generate one such point, we traverse all N queries and randomly select exactly one path from the K available candi-dates for each query. We then calculate the mean length ¯L and mean accuracy ¯A for this specific combination of selected paths. By repeating this sampling process for a large number of iterations (e.g., 10 6 times), we obtain a dense distribution of coordinates. This distribution effectively estimates the probability density of the model’s performance across the entire feasible solution space. The re-gion in the solution space where paths exhibit both higher accuracy and lower length than the origi-nal baseline confirms the existence of the Superior Paths and validates the motivation for our Neural Chain-of-Thought Search. 

A.3 Details of the Benchmarks considered 

We selected five benchmarks to empirically encom-pass the spectrum of reasoning capabilities: sym-bolic deductive reasoning, commonsense reason-ing, expert knowledge reasoning, multi-step arith-21 metic reasoning and Olympiad-level mathematical reasoning. This diversity ensures that our observed efficiency gains are substantive and extend beyond any single problem type. 

AMC23. Derived from the 2023 American Math-ematics Competitions, this dataset represents a sig-nificant step up in difficulty compared to standard arithmetic benchmarks. Unlike grade-school prob-lems, AMC23 requires rigorous multi-step logical deduction and the application of complex mathe-matical theorems. We utilize this benchmark to stress-test the model’s ability to maintain coher-ent long-chain reasoning without degenerating into circular logic, a common failure mode in harder deductive tasks. 

ARC-C (Clark et al., 2018). The Abstraction and Reasoning Challenge (Challenge Set) evalu-ates a model’s ability to infer abstract rules from few-shot examples. While originally a visual grid-based task, we utilize the text-encoded version to test the capacity to recognize patterns and general-ize to unseen problems. This benchmark is partic-ularly relevant for analyzing thinking tokens, as it demands a search process to hypothesize and verify transformation rules, distinguishing it from pure retrieval tasks. 

GPQA (Rein et al., 2023). The Graduate-Level Google-Proof Q&A benchmark consists of difficult multiple-choice questions in biology, physics, and chemistry. Validated by domain experts who hold or are pursuing PhDs, these questions are designed to be resistant to simple web search. We include GPQA to evaluate the "knowledge-intensive" rea-soning regime. Here, the efficiency bottleneck is often not the length of the deduction, but the ac-curacy of the fact retrieval and the avoidance of "hallucinated reasoning," where models generate verbose justifications for incorrect premises. 

GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021). This widely-used benchmark consists of 8.5k high-quality grade school math word problems that require 2 to 8 steps to solve. While less challenging than AMC23, its high density of arithmetic operations allows us to precisely measure the efficacy of our method in pruning redundant verification steps in well-defined solution spaces. 

OlympiadBench (He et al., 2024). As a com-prehensive dataset sourced from international Olympiad-level mathematics and physics competi-tions, this benchmark presents a formidable chal-lenge to current reasoning models. Unlike the rou-tine application of formulas in GSM8K, Olympiad-Bench demands creative problem-solving strategies and extended logical derivations. We employ it to evaluate the efficacy of our search mechanism in high complexity regimes, specifically testing its capability to navigate the deep reasoning trees re-quired for creative problem solving. 

A.4 Details of the Baselines considered Mean and Original. The Original baseline rep-resents the standard sampling (temperature=0.6, top-p=0.95) from the base model without interven-tion. The Mean baseline, as described in Section 3.3, represents the expected performance of a ran-dom search strategy where operators are sampled uniformly from the set O at decision points. This comparison isolates the specific contribution of our learned policy network versus a blind stochastic search. 

NoWait (Wang et al., 2025a). This training-free decoding strategy operates on the hypothesis that reflective tokens often signal hesitation or re-dundant loops. NoWait explicitly suppresses the generation of self-reflection tokens (e.g., "Wait", "Hmm") during the decoding process. We include this baseline to demonstrate that naive truncation of reasoning paths often degrades accuracy, whereas our method’s selective pruning preserves correct-ness. 

AdaptThink (Zhang et al., 2025a). AdaptThink is a reinforcement learning-based approach that fo-cuses on the extensive margin. It trains the model to adaptively select between "thinking" (long-CoT) and "no-thinking" (direct answer) modes based on the estimated difficulty of the input query. Un-like our fine-grained operator search which struc-tures the internal steps of the reasoning chain, AdaptThink makes a binary, high-level decision on whether to engage the reasoning engine at all. 

ThinkPrune (Hou et al., 2025). ThinkPrune ad-dresses the efficiency-accuracy trade-off by incor-porating a strict token budget into the reward func-tion during RL training. It penalizes generation length linearly or non-linearly to force the model to compress its reasoning. This baseline serves as a di-rect comparison for our length-penalty reward com-ponent, validating whether our Dual-Factor Heuris-tic Function offers superior control compared to 22 Average Accuracy 0.78 0.92 0.80 0.82 Average Accuracy  0.98 0.86 500 2500 1000 1500 2000 0.88 0.92 0.90 0.90 0.88 0.86 0.84 0.20 0.30 Average Accuracy  0.60 0.20 0.60 0.20 1600 1700 2200 1800 1900 2000 2000 2200 2400 0.30 0.50 0.40 0.30 0.50 0.40 0.60 0.50 0.40 0.20 0.25 0.30 Average Accuracy 2600 2100 2600 2200 2300 2500 2000 2200 2400 0.50 0.45 0.40 0.35 0.70 0.84 0.72 0.74 Average Accuracy  0.92 0.80 900 1300 1000 1100 1200 0.82 0.90 0.86 0.82 0.80 0.78 0.76 Average Length Average Length Average Length Llama-8B Qwen-14B Qwen-32B GSM8K GSM8K AMC23 GPQA ARC-C 500 3000 500 2500 1000 1500 2000 1500 1000 Qwen-1.5B Qwen-7B

Laser (Liu et al., 2025c). Length-bAsed StEp Reward shaping (LASER) is a technique that opti-mizes the trade-off between performance and effi-ciency using adaptive length-based incentives. It employs a step-function reward scheme that dy-namically adjusts the penalty for length based on the current training stage and problem difficulty. We include LASER as a representative of reward-shaping approaches to efficient reasoning. 

B Additional Experimental Results 

B.1 Visualizations of solution spaces for more models and more benchmarks Experimental Settings. We examine the gener-alizability of the solution space characteristics by extending the random search analysis to a broader experimental settings. We conduct comprehensive experiments across five models featuring varying parameter scales and architectures: DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-{1.5B, 7B, 14B, 32B} and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B. Furthermore, to ensure ro-bustness across different reasoning modalities, we evaluate these models on four distinct benchmarks: AMC23, ARC-C (Clark et al., 2018), GPQA (Rein et al., 2023), and GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021). Fig 7 illustrates the density heatmaps for all com-binations of models and datasets, generated using the Monte Carlo aggregation method detailed in Appendix A.2. 

Consistency of Insights. The comprehensive evaluations consistently demonstrate the four fun-damental insights discussed in Section 3.3: (1) The choice of reasoning operators induces high variance in output quality. (2) Standard decoding strategies consistently result in suboptimal paths relative to the potential maximum. (3) Superior paths that are simultaneous more accurate and efficient than the original output exist across all models and tasks. (4) These superior paths are distributed sparsely within the solution space. 

Impact of Model Scale. Beyond these confirma-tions, we observe a inverse correlation between model scale and the density of improved solutions. Comparing heatmaps reveals that the solution space area superior to the original baseline contracts as model size increases. For instance, on the GSM8K benchmark, the density of superior paths for the 

1.5B model is 9.12% , whereas this value drops to 1.30% for the 32 B model. This phenomenon suggests that larger models possess stronger intrin-sic planning capabilities. Their default generation policies align more closely with optimal reason-ing paths, narrowing the margin for improvement accessible through random exploration. 

C Related Work 

C.1 Efficient Reasoning 

Efficient reasoning has emerged as a critical re-search direction to mitigate the computational overhead and overthinking phenomenon (Sui et al., 2025) observed in Large Reasoning Mod-els (LRMs) like DeepSeek-R1 (DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025) and OpenAI o1 (OpenAI et al., 2024). We categorize existing efficient reasoning approaches into four main paradigms: Reinforcement Learn-ing (RL) with length reward design, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with variable-length data, dy-namic reasoning paradigms during inference, and prompt-guided efficiency. 

C.1.1 RL with Length Reward Design 

Reinforcement learning has been widely adopted to enhance reasoning capabilities, yet standard accuracy-based rewards often lead to verbose chains of thought. To address this, recent works incorporate length-based penalties directly into the reward function to encourage conciseness without sacrificing performance. Kimi k1.5 (Team et al., 2025) integrates a length penalty into its policy optimization (a variant of online policy mirror de-scent) to facilitate effective model merging and control long CoT activations. 01-Pruner (Luo et al., 2025c) introduces a Length-Harmonizing Reward combined with a PPO-style loss, optimizing the ratio of CoT lengths between a reference model and the student to shorten reasoning while main-taining accuracy constraints. Similarly, L1 (Ag-garwal and Welleck, 2025) modifies training data with length constraints (e.g., "Think for N tokens") before applying policy optimization. Demystifying Long CoT (Yeo et al., 2025) proposes a Cosine Re-ward based on a Dirichlet function and an exceed length penalty to stabilize performance and con-trol length growth during RL.

C.1.2 SFT with Variable-Length CoT Data 

Fine-tuning LLMs on curated variable-length CoT datasets is another effective strategy to distill effi-cient reasoning capabilities. These methods gener-ally fall into two categories: post-reasoning com-pression and during-reasoning compression. In post-reasoning compression, Distilling System 2 into System 1 (Yu et al., 2024) removes the rea-soning process entirely to distill direct answer gen-eration. C3oT (Kang et al., 2024) utilizes GPT-4 as a compressor to reduce reasoning length while retaining key information. TokenSkip (Xia et al., 2025) reduces tokens based on semantic impor-tance estimation. In during-reasoning compression, Learn to Skip (Liu et al., 2024) adopts a human-like step-skipping method, first manually creating concise solutions and then training the model to intrinsically skip steps. Token-Budget (Han et al., 2025) employs a binary search to find optimal to-ken budgets and trains the model to follow these constraints. Self-Training (Munkhbat et al., 2025) uses Best-of-N sampling to select the shortest cor-rect reasoning path as training data. CoT-Valve (Ma et al., 2025b) progressively mixes parameters of long-reasoning and non-reasoning models to gen-erate variable-length training data. To provide a structured overview of the rapidly evolving land-scape, we summarize relevant peer-reviewed con-ference papers in Table 7 and recent arXiv preprints in Table 8.

C.1.3 Inference Time Dynamic Reasoning 

Dynamic reasoning aims to optimize the infer-ence process without extensive retraining, often by selecting efficient reasoning paths or terminating early. Reward-Guided Efficient Reasoning: Specu-lative Rejection (Sun et al., 2024) optimizes Best-of-N decoding by using a reward model to peri-odically reject unpromising sequences, reducing computational overhead. RSD (Liao et al., 2025b) employs a Process Reward Model (PRM) to se-lectively accept high-quality outputs from a draft model. Confidence and Certainty-Based Adap-tive Reasoning: DPTS (Ding et al., 2025c) opti-mizes tree search by dynamically adjusting node expansion based on confidence. FastMCTS (Li et al., 2025b) prioritizes high-confidence traces in an MCTS-inspired framework. Certaindex (Fu et al., 2025a) and Dynasor (Fu et al., 2025b) al-locate compute based on a statistical measure of reasoning progress. Length-filtered Vote (Wu et al., 2025) filters out excessively short or long paths 25 Short Name Venue Year

before majority voting. CISC (Taubenfeld et al., 2025) utilizes confidence scores to implement early stopping in sampling. Consistency-Based Reason-ing: ST-BoN (Wang et al., 2025i) leverages the consistency of latent embeddings to truncate in-ferior samples early, serving as a proxy for an-swer correctness. Summarization-Based Reason-ing: LightThinker (Zhang et al., 2025b) trains mod-els to compress intermediate thoughts into "gist tokens," while InftyThink (Yan et al., 2025b) itera-tively summarizes thoughts to enable unbounded reasoning depth within context limits.

C.1.4 Prompt-Guided Efficient Reasoning 

Explicit prompting offers a lightweight mechanism to enforce efficiency. Token-Budget (Han et al., 2025) (TALE-EP) estimates a minimal token re-quirement and explicitly prompts the model to ad-here to it. Chain of Draft (CoD) (Xu et al., 2025b) encourages the model to write only a minimum draft (e.g., limiting steps to 5 words), finding that this preserves accuracy while reducing verbosity. Token Complexity (Lee et al., 2025a) analyzes the trade-off between prompt-based compression and accuracy. Concise CoT (CCoT) (Renze and Guven, 2024) simply prompts models to "be con-cise," while MARP (Chen et al., 2024) limits single-step computations to refine reasoning boundaries. Other works investigating prompt-based efficiency include Brevity (Poddar et al., 2025), PREMISE (Yu et al., 2025c), and ConciseHint (Tang et al., 2025). 

C.1.5 Related Benchmarks and Evaluations

These benchmarks primarily focus on two interconnected aspects: identifying the overthink-ing pathology in LRMs and establishing standard-ized metrics for assessing the trade-off between rea-26 Short Name Venue Year

soning quality and computational cost. For prob-lem diagnosis, benchmarks like (Hashemi et al., 2025) and (Zhang et al., 2025f) are designed to trig-ger and measure excessive verbosity on trivial or intuitive tasks, revealing a deep-seated reasoning bias. Similarly, (Srivastava et al., 2025) provides fine-grained analysis of overthinking patterns in basic math. To evaluate mitigation strategies and model calibration, benchmarks such as (Pu et al., 2025) and (Li et al., 2025g) introduce metrics like token efficiency and CoT precision/recall. Moving towards a holistic evaluation, unified frameworks like (Aggarwal et al., 2025) and (Huang et al., 2025b) formalize the dual challenge of prevent-ing waste on easy tasks while ensuring sufficient thought for hard ones, using composite scores like the E3-Score. Beyond these, parallel works also encompass benchmarks for evaluating long context understanding (Huang et al., 2025d), routing mech-anisms in LLMs (Huang et al., 2025c), and cre-ative thinking (Zhongzhan et al., 2025; Zhong et al., 2024a). These benchmarks collectively provide the necessary ground truth for developing and com-paring the RL, SFT, dynamic, and prompt-guided methods discussed in prior subsections. 

C.1.6 Connection to Our Work 

Distinct from RL (Team et al., 2025; Luo et al., 2025c; Aggarwal and Welleck, 2025; Yeo et al., 2025) and SFT (Kang et al., 2024; Ma et al., 2025b; Xia et al., 2025; Yu et al., 2024) approaches that enforce efficiency via static training objectives, our method avoids inducing a fixed length bias. We instead formulate efficiency as a dynamic search objective. This decoupling enables adaptive com-pute allocation; the model expands reasoning for complex queries and prunes redundancy for sim-pler ones. We therefore prevent the performance degradation frequently observed with forced con-ciseness (Li et al., 2025d; Jin et al., 2024). Since we intervene at inference time, our strategy re-mains orthogonal to these training-based optimiza-tions. Our framework aligns with dynamic reason-ing paradigms (Sun et al., 2024; Ding et al., 2025c; Li et al., 2025b) utilizing test-time compute, yet introduces a structural shift in the search space. While prior work relies on token-level search (Sun et al., 2024) or heuristic early stopping (Fu et al., 2025a), we reformulate CoT generation as a dy-namic search over discrete reasoning operators. By abstracting tokens into operators, we resolve the high-level planning bottleneck. This renders the search strategic and computationally feasible compared to unstructured sampling (Wang et al., 2025i). 

C.2 Test-Time Compute via Search 

The paradigm of scaling test-time compute has emerged as a critical frontier in enhancing LLM reasoning. This field can be broadly categorized through two complementary lenses: the topology of reasoning (the structural connection of thoughts) and the search algorithms (the control policies for traversing these structures). 

C.2.1 Structured Reasoning Topologies 

This line of research focuses on the structural repre-sentation of intermediate reasoning steps, moving from linear sequences to complex non-linear struc-tures (Besta et al., 2025). 27 Chain-based Structures The seminal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) (Wei et al., 2023) prompting demon-strated that eliciting intermediate reasoning steps significantly boosts performance on complex tasks. This linear topology models reasoning as a sequen-tial path graph. Extensions such as CoT-SC (Self-Consistency) (Wang et al., 2023) introduce a "Tree of Chains" topology by sampling multiple inde-pendent reasoning paths and aggregating the final answer via majority voting. While effective, chain-based methods suffer from error propagation in long-horizon tasks, as they lack mechanisms to ex-plore alternative branches once a step is generated. 

Tree-based Structures To enable exploration and backtracking, Tree of Thoughts (ToT) (Yao et al., 2023) and (Long, 2023) generalize CoT by modeling reasoning as a tree, where nodes repre-sent partial solutions or "thoughts". This allows the model to explore multiple reasoning branches at each step. Variants such as Thought Decomposition (Xie et al., 2023) and Tree-of-Mixed-Thought (Hu et al., 2023) further refine this by varying the gran-ularity of tree nodes. Other works like Skeleton-of-Thought (Ning et al., 2024) utilize a parallel tree structure (or 1-level tree) to accelerate generation by expanding independent points simultaneously. While tree topologies allow for local exploration, they often require manually defining the branching factor and depth. 

Graph-based Structures Graph of Thoughts (GoT) (Besta et al., 2024) and (Yao et al., 2024) further extend reasoning topologies to arbitrary di-rected acyclic graphs (DAGs). These frameworks introduce aggregation operations, allowing infor-mation from multiple independent reasoning paths to be combined into a synergistic solution. Simi-larly, Cumulative Reasoning (Zhang et al., 2025h) and Everything of Thoughts (XoT) (Ding et al., 2024) utilize graph structures to model complex dependencies where a thought may depend on mul-tiple non-consecutive precursors. While powerful, graph-based methods incur significant computa-tional overhead due to the complexity of managing arbitrary dependencies. 

C.2.2 Search Algorithms and Planning 

Parallel to structural definitions, significant re-search focuses on the algorithmic procedures used to traverse the reasoning space. These approaches typically formulate the reasoning task as an MDP defined by states, actions, and reward functions (Li, 2025). 

Uninformed and Heuristic Search Early at-tempts applied standard search algorithms to LLM decoding. Beam Search, as utilized in Beam-LLM (Xie et al., 2023) and PathFinder (Golovneva et al., 2023), maintains the top-k most promising partial candidates at each step. To guide the search more effectively, heuristic methods like Best-First Search (Koh et al., 2025) and A* Search have been adapted. For instance, LLM-A* (Meng et al., 2025) and ToolChain* (Zhuang et al., 2023) integrate cost-to-go heuristics (often estimating the distance to the goal) to prioritize the expansion of promising nodes. Q∗ (Wang et al., 2024) further approximates optimal Q-values to guide the search using A*-like heuristics. These methods rely heavily on the qual-ity of the heuristic function, which is often difficult to define for open-ended reasoning tasks. 

Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) MCTS has become a dominant paradigm for solving complex reasoning tasks due to its ability to balance explo-ration and exploitation. Frameworks such as RAP (Hao et al., 2023), LATS (Zhou et al., 2024), and LLM-MCTS (Zhao et al., 2023) employ MCTS to simulate future outcomes (rollouts) and back-propagate value estimates to the current state. Re-cent advancements like rStar (Qi et al., 2024) and MC-DML (Shi et al., 2025) introduce specialized selection policies and self-consistency-based eval-uations to enhance MCTS in reasoning domains. Furthermore, AlphaZero-inspired approaches like TS-LLM (Feng et al., 2024) and ReST-MCTS* (Zhang et al., 2024) integrate MCTS with model training, using the search results to iteratively fine-tune the policy and value networks. 

C.2.3 Connection to Our Work 

While existing search-based inference methods demonstrate strong performance, they typically rely on heavy sampling, expensive rollouts (as in MCTS), or rigid topological constraints (as in ToT). Our proposed Neural Chain-of-Thought Search dif-fers by internalizing the search process. Instead of managing an external search tree, we treat the dis-crete thinking tokens as the action space in a Neural Architecture Search (NAS) formulation. This al-lows our model to dynamically learn a lightweight policy that steers the reasoning topology on-the-fly, achieving the benefits of structured search with sig-nificantly lower inference latency than traditional MCTS or massive parallel sampling. 28 C.3 AutoML 

Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) aims to automate the end-to-end process of applying ma-chine learning to real-world problems, thereby re-ducing the reliance on human expertise and man-ual trial-and-error (He et al., 2021). The scope of AutoML is broad, covering various stages of the deep learning pipeline including data preparation, feature engineering, hyperparameter optimization (HPO), and model generation (Shen et al., 2024). In the realm of data preparation and feature engineer-ing, techniques have been developed for automated data cleaning, synthesis, and feature selection to maximize the predictive power of raw data (Chu et al., 2016). However, the most computationally intensive aspect of AutoML lies in model selection and optimization. Traditional approaches focused heavily on Hyperparameter Optimization (HPO) to tune static parameters such as learning rates or batch sizes using methods like Grid Search, Ran-dom Search (Bergstra and Bengio, 2012), Bayesian Optimization (Snoek et al., 2012), and bandit-based strategies like Hyperband (Li et al., 2018). With the advent of deep learning, the focus of AutoML has progressively shifted from tuning hyperparameters of fixed models to the automatic discovery of the model structure itself, leading to the emergence of Neural Architecture Search (NAS). 

C.3.1 Neural Architecture Search 

Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is a prominent subfield of AutoML dedicated to automating the design of neural network topologies, which has suc-cessfully produced architectures surpassing manu-ally designed counterparts in tasks like image clas-sification and object detection (Elsken et al., 2019). A standard NAS framework is typically categorized into three dimensions: search space, search strat-egy, and performance estimation strategy (Elsken et al., 2019). The search space defines the set of representable architectures, evolving from simple chain-structured sequences to complex cell-based search spaces (Zoph et al., 2018) and hierarchi-cal representations (Liu et al., 2018). Regarding search strategies, early works utilized Reinforce-ment Learning, where a controller RNN samples architectures and is trained via policy gradient to maximize validation accuracy (Zoph and Le, 2017). Evolutionary Algorithms (EA) have also proven effective by evolving a population of architectures through mutation and crossover operations (Real et al., 2019). To mitigate the prohibitive com-putational costs of training each candidate from scratch, recent research has pivoted towards effi-ciency. This includes differentiable search meth-ods like DARTS (Liu et al., 2019) which relax the discrete search space to allow gradient-based op-timization, and One-Shot methods (Bender et al., 2018) that utilize weight sharing within a supernet (Pham et al., 2018). Furthermore, resource-aware NAS has gained traction, where objective functions are modified to penalize computational costs such as FLOPs or latency (Tan et al., 2019), explicitly balancing performance with efficiency (Cai et al., 2019). Similar principles of architecture optimiza-tion and automatic design have been explored in di-verse domains, including diffusion models (Huang et al., 2023; Zhong et al., 2023; Lin et al., 2024), convolutional network pruning (Huang et al., 2021), and specialized vision tasks (Shi et al., 2024; Lu et al., 2024). 

C.3.2 Connection to Our Work 

Our proposed Neural Chain-of-Thought Search draws significant inspiration from the formulations and methodologies of NAS, yet adapts them to the novel domain of linguistic reasoning. Analogous to how NAS searches for an optimal sequence of layers or operations to process an image (Baymurz-ina et al., 2022), our framework searches for an optimal sequence of thinking tokens (reasoning op-erators) to process a complex query. We explicitly define a discrete search space of reasoning opera-tors and employ a policy network to navigate this space, mirroring the controller-based paradigms seen in RL-based NAS (Zoph and Le, 2017). Fur-thermore, our dual-factor heuristic function, which penalizes generation length to encourage efficient reasoning, directly parallels the multi-objective op-timization found in resource-aware NAS methods like MnasNet (Tan et al., 2019) or EfficientNet (Tan and Le, 2020). However, a critical distinc-tion lies in the granularity and dynamism of the search. While traditional NAS typically outputs a static architecture that is fixed for all dataset instances (Elsken et al., 2019), our method per-forms a dynamic, instance-wise search where the "architecture" of the reasoning path is constructed on-the-fly conditioned on the specific input query. Additionally, unlike NAS which often requires ex-pensive retraining of the searched architecture, our method optimizes the reasoning topology during inference time, leveraging the pre-trained capa-bilities of the underlying Large Language Model. 29 Prompt1

Our approach also contrasts with other automated ML techniques applied to different problem do-mains, such as multimodal recommendation sys-tems (Zhao et al., 2025d; Zhong et al., 2024b), mul-timodal association evaluation (Liu et al., 2025d), and dialogue systems (Zhong et al., 2022), which focus on optimizing specific application pipelines. 

D Characterization of Thinking Tokens 

D.1 Experimental Setup 

To explore the relationship between thinking tokens and think patterns, we analyze traces from two Small Reasoning Models: DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B. We evaluate on AMC23 (standard competition math) and AIME24 (complex reasoning chains). For each model-dataset pair, we generate full rea-soning traces, segmenting them into discrete steps via the "\n\n" delimiter. We employ DeepSeek-V3 and GPT-4o to annotate the thinking mode of each step. To ensure robustness, we utilize two prompt strategies: (1) definition-based, classifying steps against rigorous academic definitions, and (2) function-based, assessing the step’s role in the problem-solving flow (see Fig. 8 and 9). 

D.2 Analysis of Results 

We observe a deterministic correspondence be-tween specific initial tokens and the subsequent reasoning trajectory. The token "Wait" serves as a trigger for self-correction, initiating Reflection steps with a probability exceeding 90%. Similarly, "Alternatively" functions as a dedicated branch in-dicator, leading to Divergence steps in over 95% of cases. In contrast, "Thus" acts as a transitional oper-ator, distributing its probability mass nearly equally between deductive Statements and conclusive Sum-maries. This distribution suggests that thinking tokens function not merely as syntactic connec-tors but as semantic control signals that modulate the generation logic. We posit that distinct initial tokens activate specific, latent thinking modes in-30 Then The Now So Let Thus But Wait Hmm Alternatively Statement Summary Reflection Divergence Figure 10: Correlation between thinking tokens and thinking modes for DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B on the AMC23 dataset.

herent to the LRM. These modes are not explicitly defined but emerge as clustered behaviors within the model’s high-dimensional representation space. Our Neural Chain-of-Thought Search exploits this structure. By discretely selecting the optimal think-ing token at each decision point, the algorithm ef-fectively performs dynamic cognitive switching. This mechanism allows the system to navigate the solution space by actively engaging the most appro-priate latent reasoning mode for the current context, thereby maximizing solution efficiency. 

E Justification of Design Choices 

E.1 Why do we use \n\n as delimiter E.1.1 Statistical Evidence 

Our choice of the double newline ( "\n\n" ) as the delimiter for reasoning steps is grounded in the empirical analysis of Large Reasoning Models’ generation patterns. Recent work (Yang et al., 2025d) studies the distribution of tokens preced-ing “reasoning-supportive” keywords, which are terms that explicitly signal a shift in reasoning mode, including “Wait” (reflection), “Alternatively” (branching), and “Hmm” (hesitation). Their anal-ysis on the MATH500 dataset reveals a strong conditional dependence: these pivot tokens are overwhelmingly preceded by the "\n\n" delim-iter. As shown in Table 11, for the token "Wait", approximately 90% of occurrences follow a dou-ble newline. Similarly, "Alternatively" follows this Then The Now So Let Thus But Wait Hmm Alternatively Statement Summary Reflection Divergence

delimiter pattern with a probability of over 92%. This statistical dominance indicates that "\n\n" is not merely a syntactic formatter but a latent signal where the model naturally pauses to determine the trajectory of the subsequent thought process. 

E.1.2 Functional Role as Discourse Marker 

Beyond statistical correlation, the "\n\n" token functions as a critical discourse marker in the la-tent space of LRMs. The segment immediately following a double newline typically determines the functional category of the next step. Analysis categorizes these post-delimiter segments into dis-tinct modes: Affirmation (continuing the current logic), Reflection (backtracking or verifying), or Statement (deriving new formulas). For instance, when a model generates "\n\n" , it enters a "deci-sion state" where it must implicitly choose whether to proceed or reflect. In standard autoregressive de-coding, this choice is made probabilistically based on the preceding context. However, smaller mod-els often fail at this juncture, producing repetitive "Statement" steps when a "Reflection" is required, or entering verification loops unnecessarily. 

E.1.3 Implications for our work 

These findings validate our formulation of the search space defined in Section 2.1. By designat-ing "\n\n" as the decision point dt, we align our search intervention with the model’s intrinsic cog-nitive structure. Rather than imposing arbitrary 31 Keyword Previous Token Probability

boundaries, we intervene exactly at the moment the model naturally pauses to select a thinking mode. Our method effectively externalizes this implicit decision-making process. By injecting explicit op-erators (e.g., forcing a "Wait" or "So") at these precise structural breaks, we can actively steer the model out of suboptimal paths (such as the Exces-sive Reflection identified in smaller models) and toward the superior paths that optimize both accu-racy and efficiency. 

E.2 How do we choose the operator set O

We determine the composition of the operator set 

O through a statistical analysis of the vocabulary distribution in the training corpus. Specifically, we calculate the frequency of tokens that immediately follow the step delimiter "\n\n" . By selecting the tokens that most frequently initiate a new reasoning step, we ensure that our constructed search space aligns with the model’s natural generation patterns and covers the most probable reasoning transitions. 

E.2.1 Operator Set for Neural CoT Search 

In our proposed method, we employ a compre-hensive operator set O = {“The”, “Thus”, “There-fore”, “So”, “Then”, “Let”, “Wait”, “Alternatively”, “Now”, “I”, “First”, “Option”, “**”, “-”, “\[”, “\” }.We selected these tokens because they are not only statistically frequent but also serve distinct and nec-essary functional roles in structuring the reasoning process. Beyond the standard thinking tokens that guide logical flow (e.g., “Thus”, “Wait”), we ex-plicitly include functional markers. For instance, “Option” is crucial for analyzing specific choices in multiple-choice questions; “**” and “-” are widely used for emphasis and enumeration to organize complex arguments; and “\[” and “\” are essential for initiating mathematical derivation blocks. Each of these tokens represents a specific mode of oper-ation that the model frequently utilizes to construct valid reasoning steps. 

E.2.2 Operator Set for Random Search 

In contrast, for our random search experiments, we utilize a restricted subset: Orandom = {“The”, “Thus”, “Therefore”, “So”, “Then”, “Let”, “Wait”, “Alternatively” }. The rationale for this difference lies in the inherent limitation of random sampling. Unlike our learned policy, a random search agent lacks the semantic understanding to apply context-dependent formatting tokens correctly. Randomly selecting structural tokens such as “First”, “Op-tion”, “**”, “-”, or “\[” without appropriate context often leads to syntactically broken or incoherent generations (e.g., opening a math block with “\[” when no calculation is needed, or starting a list with “-” in the middle of a sentence). Therefore, we limit the random search space to purely con-nective thinking tokens to ensure that the sampled paths remain semantically plausible. 

E.2.3 Impact of Operator Set 

The selection of the operator set involves a fun-damental trade-off between search potential and computational cost. Expanding the operator set to encompass a broader vocabulary increases the coverage of the search space, which theoretically allows for the discovery of even higher-quality rea-soning paths. Specifically, while our current set is primarily optimized for English STEM reasoning, the framework allows for straightforward extension to multilingual domains by incorporating thinking tokens from other languages. Furthermore, the set can be recalibrated to support creative tasks by adding tokens that guide narrative planning or brainstorming. However, a larger set also increases the branching factor at each decision point, which raises both the training complexity of the policy network and the computational overhead during inference. Our empirical observations indicate that the current selection strikes an effective balance, enabling the discovery of superior reasoning paths while keeping the search process computationally efficient. 32 Question : “Plants have specialized tissues at the ends of their stems.

Yellow boxes: statement/summarization steps. The original model drifts into irrelevant reasoning branches, resulting in an incorrect answer. NCoTS enables the model to reach the correct conclusion with higher efficiency. 

F Case Study 

We present two qualitative comparisons between the original generation and our proposed NCoTS. As detailed in Table 12 and Table 13, these cases illustrate how current reasoning models frequently lack foresight and consequently fail to navigate the solution space efficiently. In the commonsense science query shown in Table 12, the original model experienced severe reasoning drift. Lacking a high level plan, it con-flates concepts like ends of stems with leaves and wanders into irrelevant topics such as water ab-sorption, which ultimately leads to an incorrect conclusion In contrast, NCoTS mitigates this issue by actively searching for optimal thinking mode at decision points. This mechanism allows the model to prune these inefficient branches early, effectively steering the path toward the correct solution with significantly reduced token usage. Similarly, the mathematical reasoning task in Table 13 highlights the inefficiency of myopic next token prediction. While the original model eventually finds the solu-tion, it suffers from a lack of confidence, evidenced by getting stuck in redundant verification loops and exploring complex but unnecessary branches. NCoTS eliminates this overhead by prioritizing de-cisive operators that advance the solution state. Our approach performs one succinct verification step, reflecting a more confident and efficient reasoning process. These case studies form a closed loop with our initial motivation. They confirm that the ineffi-ciency of current reasoning models stems from the failure to foresee the appropriate reasoning direc-tion at decision points. By treating reasoning as a dynamic search for the optimal thinking mode, NCoTS actively selects the suitable reasoning di-rection and effectively prunes redundant branches. This yields a superior reasoning path that is both accurate and concise, avoiding reasoning traps such as getting stuck in redundant verification loops or excessive exploration. 33 Question : There is a unique sequence of integers a1, a 2, · · · a2023 such that
