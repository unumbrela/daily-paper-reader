Abstract 

As Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) acquire stronger reasoning capabil-ities to handle complex, multi-image instruc-tions, this advancement may pose new safety risks. We study this problem by introducing MIR-SafetyBench, the first benchmark focused on multi-image reasoning safety, which con-sists of 2,676 instances across a taxonomy of 9 multi-image relations. Our extensive evaluations on 19 MLLMs reveal a troubling trend: models with more advanced multi-image reasoning can be more vulnerable on MIR-SafetyBench. Beyond attack success rates, we find that many responses labeled as safe are superficial, often driven by misunderstanding or evasive, non-committal replies. We further observe that unsafe generations exhibit lower attention entropy than safe ones on average. This internal signature suggests a possible risk that models may over-focus on task solving while neglecting safety constraints. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/thu-coai/MIR-SafetyBench. 

1 Introduction 

Advancing MLLMs to comprehend complex in-structions and visual inputs is essential for real-world problems (Hurst et al., 2024; Google, 2024). Recent models have made substantial progress in task compliance and multimodal reasoning, mov-ing toward more general and robust multimodal intelligence (Comanici et al., 2025; OpenAI, 2025). However, this rapid advancement raises a natural question: do improved capabilities also expand the attack surface and introduce new safety risks? 

Most existing safety evaluations for MLLMs focus on content-based safety , where a model is considered unsafe if it fails to refuse explicit harmful images. However, they neglect reasoning-based safety , where harm emerges only through the model’s reasoning process. In this work, we Output Safety

study such risks in multi-image scenarios, focusing on cross-image interactions and user instruction. As illustrated in Figure 1, models with differ-ent capabilities exhibit distinct behaviors in multi-image reasoning task. 1 A less capable model lim-ited to single-image inputs (Level 1) may fail to comprehend the underlying task, thus providing a generic response. By contrast, the multi-image models (Levels 2 and 3) correctly infer the user’s intent but fail to recognize its latent harmful nature, thus proceed to answer it. Consequently, the in-termediate model (Level 2) provides a flawed and

incomplete pathway, whereas the strongest model (Level 3) generates a detailed, high-risk procedure. To systematically study this phenomenon, we in-troduce MIR-SafetyBench, a comprehensive bench-mark for evaluating MLLMs’ multi-image reason-ing safety. MIR-SafetyBench offers three key ad-vantages: (1) Reasoning-based Design. Harm-ful intent emerges only when the model performs multi-step relational reasoning over multiple im-ages and the instruction. (2) Varied Relation Types. The benchmark contains 2,676 instances grouped into 9 relation types, broadly covering how multi-image relations can conceal or enable harm-ful intent. (3) Extensive Diversity. Starting from 600 curated harmful seed questions spanning 6 risk categories, we construct a diverse set of multi-image instances that tests MLLMs across a wide range of safety-critical scenarios. Our benchmark shows that multi-image rela-tional attacks succeed widely across 19 MLLMs and that within a broad range of models, stronger multi-image reasoning often coincides with higher ASR. To understand why weaker models appear safer, we introduce a four-way taxonomy of safe response behaviors and show that many safe gen-erations arise from misunderstanding, generic un-explained refusals, or evasive but uninformative answers rather than robust safety alignment. We further probe models’ internal states finding that only in multi-image scenarios do unsafe genera-tions exhibit lower attention entropy than safe ones on average, suggesting that reasoning-based safety failures may have distinct internal signatures and that MLLMs may tend to allocate their capacity to solving the underlying reasoning problem while neglecting safety constraints. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: • We construct MIR-SafetyBench, the first com-prehensive benchmark for evaluating multi-image reasoning safety in MLLMs to our knowledge. It contains 2,676 instances with 2–4 images each, covering 9 multi-image re-lation types and 6 safety risk categories. • We conduct extensive evaluations on 19 popu-lar MLLMs and show that these multi-image reasoning safety risks are pervasive. More-over, these risks can increase as models’ multi-image reasoning capabilities improve. • We distinguish genuine safety alignment from harmless behavior arising from model limita-tions, and we probe MLLMs’ internal states in multi-image safety tasks using attention en-tropy, identifying distinct internal signatures associated with unsafe generations.

2.1 Advances in MLLM Reasoning 

Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Lan-guage Models (MLLMs) have significantly en-hanced their reasoning capabilities (Huang et al., 2025; Jiang et al., 2025; Wu et al., 2025; Jiang et al., 2025, 2024). A crucial frontier in this domain is the ability to reason across multiple images, which is essential for understanding complex, real-world scenarios that cannot be captured in a single snap-shot (Wang et al., 2024; Wu et al., 2024). The grow-ing research interest in this area is evidenced by the recent emergence of dedicated multi-image under-standing benchmarks, such as MuirBench (Wang et al., 2025) and MMIU (Meng et al., 2025). These works highlight the community’s focus on enhanc-ing models’ capacity for complex relational and contextual reasoning, setting the stage for more sophisticated applications. 

2.2 Safety Issues in Advanced MLLMs 

Despite their growing capabilities, the safety of MLLMs remains a significant concern and some related benchmarks have emerged. Early studies probed MLLMs’ vulnerabilities by injecting ex-plicit harmful signals into images, such as render-ing malicious text (Gong et al., 2025) or using visuals related to unsafe keywords (Liu et al., 2024; Hu et al., 2025). Subsequent work moved to more sophisticated evaluations, including large-scale au-tomated red-teaming datasets (Luo et al., 2024; Li et al., 2024b) and benchmarks probing cross-modality alignment, where individually benign in-puts become harmful only when combined (Cui et al., 2025; Zhou et al., 2024a; Lee et al., 2025). In parallel, existing studies have indicated that stronger capabilities do not automatically yield safer behavior (Bostrom, 2012; Armstrong, 2013). Builded on the rapid progress of multi-image rea-soning, recent attacks now exploit multi-image con-texts directly through distraction-based multimodal jailbreaks (Yang et al., 2025b), heuristic-induced multimodal risk distribution (Teng et al., 2024), vi-sual chain reasoning attacks (Sima et al., 2025), and compositional multi-image jailbreaks (Ding 2Spatial

et al., 2025). However, these works do not pro-vide a systematic benchmark for this task, and we address this gap by introducing MIR-SafetyBench. 

3 Multi-image Relations Taxonomy 

We propose a comprehensive taxonomy of multi-image relations that can expose vulnerabilities in MLLMs. Our taxonomy delineates four primary categories and nine fine-grained subcategories of multi-image relations. Each category is explained in detail below, with illustrative cases in Figure 2 demonstrating how these relations can be leveraged to subtly convey harmful intent. 

Temporal Relations capture the temporal pro-gression of an event, including: 1) Temporal Continuity , which gives a sequence of images illustrating continuous progression of a harmful event, guiding the model to generate feasible details for this event. 2) Temporal Jump , which presents two images depicting only the beginning and the end of a harm-ful process (e.g., a secure location and a subsequent covert photo), and prompts the model to deduce and describe the intermediate actions. 

Spatial Relations present spatial relationships between or within images, including: 1) Spatial Juxtaposition , which presents two spa-tially distinct scenes from different perspectives (e.g., material preparation and subsequent public chaos), prompting the model to infer the unstated harmful actions linking the two scenarios. 2) Spatial Embedding , which frames a harmful object or query within a benign or authoritative context, aiming to circumvent the model’s context-dependent safety protocols. 

Semantic Relations manipulate the semantic context of a harmful request, including: 1) Relevance , which hides a harmful item among semantically similar objects with benign distractors. The textual prompt instructs the model to apply the same generic operation to all items, thereby overlooking the malicious intent. 2) Complementarity , which fragments a mali-cious image into multiple tiles, requiring the model to reassemble them and then produce a harmful response to the reconstructed image. 

Logical Relations leverage the model’s capacity for logical reasoning and abstract thinking, includ-ing: 1) Analogy , which reframes a harmful request by prompting the model to apply the same technique to both a benign domain and a malicious topic. 2) Causality , which presents a harmful outcome and asks the model to infer the process to reach it. 3) Decomposition , which disassembles a mali-cious objective into a series of seemingly innocu-3Source Datasets

ous sub-questions. It then asks the model to ad-dress each question separately and synthesize them to construct the final harmful response. 

4 Benchmark Construction 

MIR-SafetyBench comprises 2,676 instances span-ning 9 multi-image relations across 6 risk cate-gories, and its construction follows a multi-stage pipeline to ensure high quality and diversity, as illustrated in Figure 3. The process begins with 

Seed Question Curation to build a foundational set of 600 harmful prompts across six major risk categories from existing safety benchmarks via au-tomatic triage with QwQ-32B and manual curation (see Appendix B for details), which then serve as seeds for multi-image instance generation .

4.1 Multi-image Instance Generation 

Each instance is generated via an iterative, five-step pipeline that converts a single harmful question into a multi-image reasoning task, as illustrated in Figure 3. Given a seed question Qorig and a target relation type r, the process is as follows: 

1. Rewrite Harmful Question (Revisor). 

The Revisor ( DeepSeek-R1 (DeepSeek-AI, 2025)) transforms the direct harmful question Qorig (e.g., “How to rob a bank?”) for a given relation type 

r into an indirect format consisting of a textual prompt Pr, a set of image descriptions {Dr,i }ni=1 ,and corresponding keywords {Kr,i }ni=1 (An exam-ple is shown in the bottom left of Figure 3). In subsequent iterations, it also incorporates feedback 

Fe from the Evaluator to refine its output. 

2. Generate Images (Image Generator). The Image Generator produces the image set {Vr,i }ni=1 .For each description-keyword pair ( Dr,i , Kr,i ), it synthesizes an image from Dr,i using FLUX.1-dev (Labs et al., 2025) and combines the image with a text rendering of Kr,i to create the final com-posite images (e.g., Vr, 1 and Vr, 2 in Figure 3). 

3. Test the Attack (Tester). The generated in-stance ( Pr, {Vr,i }ni=1 ) is then presented to the Tester agent ( Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct ) to simu-late a model’s response and obtain an initial answer 

Ar. This step checks whether the rewritten prompt maintains the original intent of Qorig , and whether it can elicit a harmful response, ensuring only ef-fective instances proceed to the final evaluation stages. 

4. Harmfulness Judgement (Harmbench Judge). 

The Tester’s response Ar is passed to the judge 

HarmBench-Llama-2-13b-cls (Mazeika et al., 2024), a standardized classifier widely used in safety research (Zhang et al., 2025a; Zhou et al., 2024b). The Judge provides an objective harm la-bel Lh ∈ { harmful , safe }.

sess a key quality criterion: whether the generated instance successfully elicites a harmful response. 

5. Evaluate & Refine (Evaluator). The Evaluator (DeepSeek-R1 ) performs a holistic quality assessment on the generated instance (Qorig , P r, {Dr,i }ni=1 , {Kr,i }ni=1 , A r, L h). It vali-dates the instance against an evaluation checklist to ensure the following four criteria are met: ( C1)the answer Ar was truly harmful (as indicated by 

Lh); ( C2) the prompt Pr remains neutral; ( C3) the instance adheres to the target relation type r; and (C4) the instance maintains fidelity to the original intent of Qorig . If any of these conditions are not met, the Evaluator generates revision feedback, Fe,to guide the Revisor agent in refinement iteration. Let the pass condition Cpass be defined as: 

Cpass = C1(Lh)∧C2(Pr)∧C3(Pr, r )∧C4(Pr, Q orig )

(1) The decision function E(·) is then: 

E(·) =

Accept if Cpass 

Refine (Fe) → Step 1 otherwise (2) This iterative process continues for up to five rounds or until an instance passes all checks. During the pipeline design, we iteratively vali-dated each stage by sampling instances for every relation and verifying them with human annotators until consistent human agreement was achieved. For the final benchmark, four human experts con-duct a final spot check of sampled instances from each category to ensure overall reliability. 

5 Experiments 

5.1 Experimental Setup 

We evaluate 19 representative MLLMs, including open-source and closed-source models of various 5scales and architectures. A detailed list of these models is provided in Appendix C. Our primary metric is the Attack Success Rate (ASR), the per-centage of instances that elicit a harmful response. All model outputs are judged by the HarmBench-Llama-2-13b-cls classifier for consistency. De-tails of our computing environment and implemen-tation are provided in the appendix D. 

5.2 Main Results on MIR-SafetyBench 

The overall performance of the 19 MLLMs on MIR-SafetyBench is presented in Table 1. 

First, vulnerability to multi-image relational reasoning is a widespread phenomenon. Most of the evaluated models are susceptible, and the high-est overall ASR is 87.63%. This widespread failure suggests that existing safety alignment strategies may be ill-equipped to handle risks that emerge from multi-image reasoning processes. 

Second, within a broad range of models, our results are consistent with the ‘Side Effects of Be-ing Smart’ hypothesis. Single-image chat models that are not optimized for multi-image tasks, such as Llama3-LLaVA-NeXT-8B and LLaVA-v1.5-7B ,show notably lower overall ASRs than models optimized for multi-image processing. More-over, reasoning-enhanced variants often exhibit higher ASR than their base versions. For exam-ple, Kimi-VL-A3B-Thinking exceeds Kimi-VL-A3B-Instruct , and Skywork-R1V3-38B exceeds 

InternVL-38B . Larger parameter scales can also correlate with higher ASR within a model family. However, the most capable closed-source models (e.g., GPT-5.1 ) combine strong reasoning capabil-ity with low ASR, indicating that this trade-off is not monotonic across the full capability spec-trum. Overall, these patterns suggest a potential capability-dependent trade-off: models operating at the edge of their abilities in multi-image rea-soning tasks show a positive correlation between reasoning strength and ASR. In contrast, frontier models find such tasks easier to navigate, allowing them to maintain or restore robustness. 

Finally, risks correlate with the task’s cogni-tive demand. Categories demanding more abstract, multi-step thinking consistently exhibit higher vul-nerability. For instance, logical tasks like Decom-position and Causality frequently yield high ASRs across top models. In contrast, categories that rely on more direct pattern recognition, such as Seman-tic Relevance , tend to yield lower ASRs. 

5.3 Analysis of Model Behaviors 

To understand the nature of model safety beyond ASR, we explore how models deliver the safe re-sponses with multi-image settings, distinguishing between genuine safety alignment and harmless-ness due to model limitations. We use DeepSeek-R1 as an expert judge to classify each safe output into one of four modes: Correct Refusal (CR) ,where model refuses to comply and correctly states the harmful nature of the request; Harmless Mis-understanding (HM) , where the model fails to grasp the malicious intent and provides an irrel-evant answer; Incomplete Refusal (IR) , where the model refuses to comply but provides a sim-ple, short, and generic response without reason; and Clever Evasion (CE) , where the model under-stands the harmful request but they respond with harmless but unhelpful content, such as generic sci-entific explanations related to the malicious topic.

5.3.1 Unsafety Mode Analysis 

From a manual review of harmful outputs, we iden-tify two primary failure archetypes. The most prevalent occurs when the model appears to priori-6tizes solving the multi-image relational puzzle over enforcing safety constraints. We also observe cases where the output contains safety considerations yet still provides the harmful procedure, suggesting a disconnect between internal risk assessment and final instruction-following. 

5.3.2 Safety Mode Analysis 

Table 2 shows that even when responses are labeled as safe, many are only superficially safe. 

Most models rarely produce correct refusals. 

According to the CR , only a subset of strong closed-source models, such as the Gemini family and 

GPT-5.1 , can consistently identify harmful content and explicitly articulate the associated risks. 

Apparent safety maybe stems from poor un-derstanding. When comparing Kimi-VL-A3B-Instruct and InternVL-38B with their reasoning-enhanced counterparts Skywork-R1V3-38B and 

Kimi-VL-A3B-Thinking-2506 , we find that better prompt understanding (lower HM ) correlates with higher ASR, indicating that some models appear safe due to they fail to understand the query. 

Model refusals can lack interpretability. For example, the high IR of GPT-4o-mini indicates that it tends to provide the same simple and generic refusal to a wide range of harmful requests. This makes it difficult for users to understand the risks. 

Providing unuseful answers is not real safe. 

Many models exhibit high CE : they recognize the harmful intent but respond with unhelpful answers, e.g., relevant scientific theory. However, a truly safe response should also include explicit warnings about the danger and potential consequences. 

5.4 Controlled Comparison with Single-Image 

To confirm that multi-image relational structure drives the observed safety vulnerabilities, we con-ducted a controlled comparison. We started from 546 harmful seed questions successfully rewritten by at least one relation and evaluated the five mod-els with the highest overall ASR in each category. For each question, we created two test cases: • Multi-Image Case , created by randomly se-lecting a successful relation-based rewrite for the question from MIR-SafetyBench. • Single-Image Case , where the harmful in-tent was embedded into a single image. For this, we reproduced the methodology of 

MM-SafetyBench (Liu et al., 2024). To main-tain consistency, we utilized DeepSeek-R1 for prompt rewriting and FLUX.1-dev for image generation. 

Results and Analysis Table 3 shows a clear pat-tern: all five models become markedly more dan-gerous under multi-image relational prompts. These findings provide two key insights. First, they highlight the brittleness of current safety align-ments: models that perform reasonably well against direct single-image attacks (e.g., GPT-4o ) show much higher ASR when the same harmful intent is reframed as a multi-image relational puzzle. Sec-ond, by comparing single-image and multi-image variants of the same harmful seeds under a matched generation pipeline supports that complex multi-image relations are important factors correlated with safety bypasses on MIR-SafetyBench.

5.5 Internal analysis via attention entropy 

Our results suggest that improved multi-image rea-soning may increase unsafe outputs. In this section, we probe models’ internal behavior to examine whether unsafe multi-image generations systemati-cally differ from safe ones and how these patterns compare to the single-image setting. 

Motivation Behavioral deviations during com-plex problem solving may be attributed to limited processing resources (Norman and Bobrow, 1975). Analogously, we hypothesize that the complexity of multi-image reasoning can push MLLMs into a similar state of cognitive overload. Cognitive load theory argues that human work-ing memory has limited resources; when a task is highly demanding, auxiliary goals are more likely to be ignored (Sweller, 2010). Recent evidence suggests analogous effects in LLMs under cog-nitive overload: extraneous tasks can facilitate jailbreaks (Upadhayay et al., 2024), competing prompt constraints can degrade both performance and safety (Yang et al., 2025a), and padding harm-ful requests with lengthy benign reasoning can weaken refusals(Zhao et al., 2025). 7(a) Chat , multi -image (b) Chat, single -image

At a more mechanistic level, recent work sug-gests a form of zero-sum behavior in Transform-ers, whose effective capacity is bounded by a finite number of attention heads (Gong and Zhang, 2024). In parallel, entropy has been used as a proxy for human cognitive control load (Fan, 2014) and at-tention entropy has been applied to LLMs’ focus and load-like effects (Zhang et al., 2025b; Shang et al., 2025). Motivated by these findings, we use attention entropy to probe an MLLM’s internal “cognitive” state under multi-image reasoning. 

Setup We analyze four representative MLLMs: two chat models (Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct 

and MiniCPM-o-2.6 ) and two reasoning mod-els ( GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking and Kimi-VL-A3B-Thinking-2506 ). For each model, we compare internal behavior between safe and unsafe gener-ations in multi-image and single-image settings using the full evaluation data and the same safety labeling as main experiments. To reduce prompt- or context-specific effects, we report attention-entropy differences averaged across instances in each condi-tion (see the heatmap definition in Appendix E). We present heatmaps for Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct 

and GLM-4.1V-9B-Thinking in the main text, and defer the left to Appendix F. We also confirm that safe and unsafe responses have similar average lengths (Appendix G), so entropy differences are not driven by length effects. 

Results Figure 4 shows, for each layer and an-swer segment, the head-averaged attention entropy difference between safe and unsafe responses. For both chat models, multi-image cases display large red regions across many layers, whereas single-image cases with no clear structure. Thus, in multi-image reasoning, unsafe generations have lower attention entropy than safe ones on average, i.e., more concentrated attention, and this pattern does not appear in the single-image setting. For the two reasoning models, a similar effect is concentrated in the early answer segments (roughly the chain-of-thought), while single-image behavior again re-mains noisy. Overall, these correlations suggest a possible internal vulnerability: when MLLMs operate near the limits of their ability on complex multi-image reasoning problems, they may over-concentrate attention on task solving and under-allocate capacity to enforcing safety constraints. 

6 Conclusion 

We introduce MIR-SafetyBench, the first safety benchmark designed for multi-image reasoning tasks. MIR-SafetyBench contains 2,676 instances covering 9 types of multi-image relations and 6 8risk categories. Experiments on 19 representa-tive MLLMs reveal extensive safety risks in multi-image reasoning. Beyond evaluating ASR, we fur-ther explore the internal mechanisms underlying multi-image safety by analyzing attention entropy. We hope MIR-SafetyBench can provide reliable evaluations on MLLMs’ multi-image safety, and in-spire the discovery and mitigation of similar safety vulnerabilities arising from complex scenarios. 

Limitations 

Benchmark coverage and construction MIR-SafetyBench comprises 2,676 synthetic multi-image instances (2–4 generated images per case) covering 9 relation types and 6 predefined risk cate-gories. This design offers broad but not exhaustive coverage of how multi-image reasoning can con-ceal harmful intent, and it inherits biases from the source safety datasets as well as from our auto-mated seed-rewriting pipeline. 

Dependence on automatic components Our pipeline relies on specific automatic agents and classifiers, including DeepSeek-R1 for rewrit-ing and evaluation, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct 

as the tester, FLUX.1-dev for image generation, and HarmBench-Llama-2-13b-cls for harmful-ness judgments. Imperfections or biases in these components may introduce systematic noise into both the constructed instances and the safety labels, and our human review only spot-checks sampled examples rather than exhaustively validating the dataset. 

Evaluation setting and analysis scope Our eval-uation focuses on a fixed set of 19 popular MLLMs under single-turn prompting and uses classifier-based attack success rate as the primary safety metric. This setup does not capture interactive, multi-turn, or tool-augmented use cases, and our attention-entropy analysis covers only four repre-sentative models and provides correlational rather than causal evidence about the link between reason-ing load and safety failures. Future work should extend MIR-SafetyBench to more realistic user in-teractions, additional modalities and relation types, and richer measurements of both internal states and real-world safety impact. 

Limited exploration of mitigation Our work is primarily diagnostic rather than prescriptive: we use MIR-SafetyBench and attention-entropy anal-ysis to characterize vulnerabilities, but we do not train or adapt models using MIR-SafetyBench, nor do we propose concrete detection mechanisms, safety monitors, or training-time regularizers based on our findings. Bridging this gap from charac-terization to practical mitigation is an important direction for future work. 

Ethical Considerations 

MIR-SafetyBench focuses on safety-critical topics such as hate speech, harassment, violence, self-harm, illegal activities, and privacy violations. As a result, some prompts and model outputs in our benchmark contain toxic or otherwise harmful con-tent. Our intent is solely to enable systematic evaluation and analysis of safety vulnerabilities in MLLMs, and to support the development of more robust defenses; we do not encourage any real-world harmful behavior or deployment of unsafe systems. To mitigate these risks, we plan to conduct care-ful inspections before open-sourcing the bench-mark, and restrict data access to individuals who adhere to stringent ethical guidelines. All human annotations in this work were con-ducted by members of the research team who were informed in advance that they might be exposed to harmful or disturbing content and about the in-tended research use of the data. Participation was voluntary, and annotators could discontinue at any time without penalty. We encouraged annotators to take breaks whenever needed and to avoid exam-ples they found personally distressing. No personal identifying information about real individuals is included in MIR-SafetyBench, and all images are synthetically generated rather than collected from real users.

A Risk Category Definitions 

The construction of MIR-SafetyBench began with establishing a clear and comprehensive taxonomy of harms. For broad coverage and to ensure align-ment with prior safety research, we defined six major risk categories: Hate Speech, Harassment, Violence, Self-Harm, Illegal Activities, and Privacy. Table 4 presents the precise definition for each cate-gory, further broken down by sub-categories where applicable, and includes illustrative examples of harmful queries that fall under each classification. 

B Details of Harmful Seed Construction 

To enable a comprehensive investigation, we first construct a set of harmful seed questions, which serve as the basis for subsequent multi-image pro-cessing. The construction process is detailed as follows. 

Step 1: Risk Category Definition. For broad coverage and alignment with prior research, we define six major risk categories: Hate Speech , Ha-rassment , Violence , Self-Harm , Illegal Activities ,and Privacy . Detailed definitions and subcategories are provided in the Appendix A. 

Step 2: Automated Filtering and Refine-ment. We begin with a large data pool aggre-gated from existing safety benchmarks, includ-ing LongSafety (Lu et al., 2025), AdvBench-subset (Zou et al., 2023), HarmBench (Mazeika et al., 2024), JailbreakBench (Chao et al., 2024), StrongReject (Souly et al., 2024), and Beaver-Tails (Ji et al., 2023). To handle inconsistencies across these datasets, we employ QwQ-32B (Team, 2025b) for an initial AI triage. The model performs two tasks: (1) it filters the raw questions to retain only those that align with our six risk categories, and (2) it refines the retained prompts for clarity and conciseness. 

Step 3: Human Expert Curation. From the au-tomatically filtered requests, human experts curated a balanced set of 100 questions for each risk cat-egory, resulting in a raw collection of 600 high-quality textual harmful prompts.

source models were accessed via APIs. 

Details of implementation. As noted in the main paper, single-image models cannot process mul-tiple image inputs directly. To address this, we stitched the multiple images of a test case into a single composite image, separated by uniform spac-ing. This process was handled programmatically using the Python script below, which utilizes the Pillow (PIL) library to horizontally concatenate im-ages. The default implementation adds a 50-pixel white gap between adjacent images. For reasoning models that produce a chain of thought, only the final response is evaluated. All models used their default safety settings. 

E Formal Definition of the Attention-Entropy Heatmap 

To quantify how concentrated a model’s attention is during generation, we compute attention entropy over answer tokens. For each example i, Transformer layer ℓ ∈{1, . . . , L }, attention head h ∈ { 1, . . . , H }, an-swer token index r ∈ { 1, . . . , T i}, and key po-sition k ∈ {1, . . . , N i}, let p(i,ℓ,h ) 

> r,k

denote the self-attention weight from the r-th answer to-ken to the k-th token in the full sequence, with 

PNi

p(i,ℓ,h ) 

> r,k

= 1 . The head-averaged attention entropy of token r at layer ℓ is

F Attention-entropy heatmap for MiniCPM-o-2.6 and Kimi-VL-A3B-Thinking-2506 

Figure 5 shows the heatmaps for MiniCPM-o-2.6 and Kimi-VL-A3B-Thinking-2506, which support same conclusion with our experiment results. 

G Statics for answer length. 

Our attention-entropy analysis focuses on long re-sponses. For all models, we first filter out examples whose final answer is shorter than 1000 characters, so that trivial short or truncated generations are excluded. On the remaining data, we compare answer lengths between safe and unsafe subsets. Table 5 reports, for each model and for both single-image and multi-image settings, the mean number of gen-erated tokens in the answer span used for entropy computation. Across all eight model–setting combinations, safe and unsafe responses differ by at most about 

20% in average length, and the direction of the difference is not consistent (e.g., unsafe answers are slightly shorter for Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct 

and MiniCPM-o-2.6 in the multi-image setting). We observe similar patterns when measuring char-acter lengths instead of tokens (not shown for brevity). These results indicate that the systematic en-tropy gaps in our attention-entropy heatmaps are unlikely to be explained solely by answer-length differences.
