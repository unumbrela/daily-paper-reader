tldr: 本研究针对遗传算法（GA）在宇宙学非参数化重建中易陷入局部最优且对导数敏感的局限性，提出了 GAME 方法。该方法通过对 GA 配置集成进行加权平均（权衡拟合度与平滑度），并结合路径积分与集成方差来精确估计误差。通过对哈勃常数 H(z) 和暗能量状态方程 w(z) 的重建，证明了该方法在处理观测数据时的稳健性，为未来区分宇宙学模型提供了更具竞争力的工具。
motivation: 传统的遗传算法在处理涉及导数的非观测物理量时，容易受到随机性、超参数选择及局部最小值的影响。
method: 提出 GAME 框架，利用集成配置的加权平均值进行函数重建，并引入路径积分方法来修正和估计解析误差。
result: 在通用测试函数和宇宙年代学数据上的应用显示，该方法能有效重建 H(z)，且结果与 ΛCDM 模型保持一致。
conclusion: GAME 方法显著增强了遗传算法的可靠性与稳健性，使其成为未来第四阶段宇宙学巡天中模型判别的强有力工具。

## Abstract
Genetic Algorithms (GA) are a powerful tool for stochastic optimisation and non-parametric symbolic regression, already widely used in cosmology. They are capable of reconstructing analytical functions directly from data points without introducing new physical models. A limitation of this approach is that while the reconstructed function is very efficient at reproducing the behaviour of the data points, non-observable quantities involving derivatives are particularly sensitive to stochasticity, hyperparameters, and to the choice of the best-fit function obtained by the GA, which implies the risk of the algorithm getting stuck in a local minimum. In this work we propose an update to the GA methodology for the reconstruction of analytical functions that involves computing a weighted average of an ensemble of GA configurations (\texttt{GAME}). We define the weights via a quantity that accounts for both the goodness-of-fit of the points and the smoothness of the resulting function. We also present a practical method to analytically estimate and correct the errors on the averaged function by combining a path-integral approach with an ensemble variance. We demonstrate the improvement offered by \texttt{GAME} methodology on a generic test function. We then apply the new methodology to a non-parametric reconstruction of the Hubble rate $H(z)$ using Cosmic Chronometers data and, assuming a flat Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker background and General Relativity, we infer the corresponding dark energy equation of state $w(z)$. Through consistency tests, we show that current data produces results compatible with $Λ$CDM, and that Stage IV cosmology surveys will allow GA reinforced with \texttt{GAME} methodology to become an even more competitive tool for discriminating between different models.
