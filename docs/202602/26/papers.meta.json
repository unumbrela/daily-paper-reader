      "abstract_en": "Symbolic Regression (SR) tries to reveal the hidden equations behind observed data. However, most methods search within a discrete equation space, where the structural modifications of equations rarely align with their numerical behavior, leaving fitting error feedback too noisy to guide exploration. To address this challenge, we propose GenSR, a generative latent space-based SR framework following the `map construction -> coarse localization -> fine search'' paradigm. Specifically, GenSR first pretrains a dual-branch Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) to reparameterize symbolic equations into a generative latent space with symbolic continuity and local numerical smoothness. This space can be regarded as a well-structured `map'' of the equation space, providing directional signals for search. At inference, the CVAE coarsely localizes the input data to promising regions in the latent space. Then, a modified CMA-ES refines the candidate region, leveraging smooth latent gradients. From a Bayesian perspective, GenSR reframes the SR task as maximizing the conditional distribution $p(\\mathrm{Equ.} \\mid \\mathrm{Num.})$, with CVAE training achieving this objective through the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO). This new perspective provides a theoretical guarantee for the effectiveness of GenSR. Extensive experiments show that GenSR jointly optimizes predictive accuracy, expression simplicity, and computational efficiency, while remaining robust under noise.\n\n---"

      "abstract_en": "Symbolic distillation replaces neural networks, or components thereof, with interpretable, closed-form mathematical expressions. This approach has shown promise in discovering physical laws and mathematical relationships directly from trained deep learning models, yet adoption remains limited due to the engineering barrier of integrating symbolic regression into deep learning workflows. We introduce SymTorch, a library that automates this distillation by wrapping neural network components, collecting their input-output behavior, and approximating them with human-readable equations via PySR. SymTorch handles the engineering challenges that have hindered adoption: GPU-CPU data transfer, input-output caching, model serialization, and seamless switching between neural and symbolic forward passes. We demonstrate SymTorch across diverse architectures including GNNs, PINNs and transformer models. Finally, we present a proof-of-concept for accelerating LLM inference by replacing MLP layers with symbolic surrogates, achieving an 8.3\\% throughput improvement with moderate performance degradation.\n\n---"

      "abstract_en": "Discovering physical laws directly from high-dimensional visual data is a long-standing human pursuit but remains a formidable challenge for machines, representing a fundamental goal of scientific intelligence. This task is inherently difficult because physical knowledge is low-dimensional and structured, whereas raw video observations are high-dimensional and redundant, with most pixels carrying little or no physical meaning. Extracting concise, physically relevant variables from such noisy data remains a key obstacle. To address this, we propose Pixel2Phys, a collaborative multi-agent framework adaptable to any Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). It emulates human scientific reasoning by employing a structured workflow to extract formalized physical knowledge through iterative hypothesis generation, validation, and refinement. By repeatedly formulating, and refining candidate equations on high-dimensional data, it identifies the most concise representations that best capture the underlying physical evolution. This automated exploration mimics the iterative workflow of human scientists, enabling AI to reveal interpretable governing equations directly from raw observations. Across diverse simulated and real-world physics videos, Pixel2Phys discovers accurate, interpretable governing equations and maintaining stable long-term extrapolation where baselines rapidly diverge.\n\n---"

      "abstract_en": "Inspired by behavioral science, we propose Behavior Learning (BL), a novel general-purpose machine learning framework that learns interpretable and identifiable optimization structures from data, ranging from single optimization problems to hierarchical compositions. It unifies predictive performance, intrinsic interpretability, and identifiability, with broad applicability to scientific domains involving optimization. BL parameterizes a compositional utility function built from intrinsically interpretable modular blocks, which induces a data distribution for prediction and generation. Each block represents and can be written in symbolic form as a utility maximization problem (UMP), a foundational paradigm in behavioral science and a universal framework of optimization. BL supports architectures ranging from a single UMP to hierarchical compositions, the latter modeling hierarchical optimization structures. Its smooth and monotone variant (IBL) guarantees identifiability. Theoretically, we establish the universal approximation property of BL, and analyze the M-estimation properties of IBL. Empirically, BL demonstrates strong predictive performance, intrinsic interpretability and scalability to high-dimensional data.

      "abstract_en": "Accurate prediction of shaft rotational speed, shaft power, and fuel consumption is crucial for enhancing operational efficiency and sustainability in maritime transportation. Conventional physics-based models provide interpretability but struggle with real-world variability, while purely data-driven approaches achieve accuracy at the expense of physical plausibility. This paper introduces a Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (PI-KAN), a hybrid method that integrates interpretable univariate feature transformations with a physics-informed loss function and a leakage-free chained prediction pipeline. Using operational and environmental data from five cargo vessels, PI-KAN consistently outperforms the traditional polynomial method and neural network baselines. The model achieves the lowest mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE), and the highest coefficient of determination (R^2) for shaft power and fuel consumption across all vessels, while maintaining physically consistent behavior. Interpretability analysis reveals rediscovery of domain-consistent dependencies, such as cubic-like speed-power relationships and cosine-like wave and wind effects. These results demonstrate that PI-KAN achieves both predictive accuracy and interpretability, offering a robust tool for vessel performance monitoring and decision support in operational settings.\n\n---"

      "abstract_en": "Reliable object manipulation requires understanding physical properties that vary across objects and environments. Vision-language model (VLM) planners can reason about friction and stability in general terms; however, they often cannot predict how a specific ball will roll on a particular surface or which stone will provide a stable foundation without direct experience. We present PhysMem, a memory framework that enables VLM robot planners to learn physical principles from interaction at test time, without updating model parameters. The system records experiences, generates candidate hypotheses, and verifies them through targeted interaction before promoting validated knowledge to guide future decisions. A central design choice is verification before application: the system tests hypotheses against new observations rather than applying retrieved experience directly, reducing rigid reliance on prior experience when physical conditions change. We evaluate PhysMem on three real-world manipulation tasks and simulation benchmarks across four VLM backbones. On a controlled brick insertion task, principled abstraction achieves 76% success compared to 23% for direct experience retrieval, and real-world experiments show consistent improvement over 30-minute deployment sessions."

      "abstract_en": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant potential in scientific discovery but struggle to bridge the gap between theoretical reasoning and verifiable physical simulation. Existing solutions operate in a passive \"execute-then-response\" loop and thus lacks runtime perception, obscuring agents to transient anomalies (e.g., numerical instability or diverging oscillations). To address this limitation, we propose EmbodiedAct, a framework that transforms established scientific software into active embodied agents by grounding LLMs in embodied actions with a tight perception-execution loop. We instantiate EmbodiedAct within MATLAB and evaluate it on complex engineering design and scientific modeling tasks. Extensive experiments show that EmbodiedAct significantly outperforms existing baselines, achieving SOTA performance by ensuring satisfactory reliability and stability in long-horizon simulations and enhanced accuracy in scientific modeling."

      "abstract_en": "Legal reasoning requires not only high accuracy but also the ability to justify decisions through verifiable and contestable arguments. However, existing Large Language Model (LLM) approaches, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), often produce unstructured explanations that lack a formal mechanism for verification or user intervention. To address this limitation, we propose Adaptive Collaboration of Argumentative LLMs (ACAL), a neuro-symbolic framework that integrates adaptive multi-agent collaboration with an Arena-based Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Framework (A-QBAF). ACAL dynamically deploys expert agent teams to construct arguments, employs a clash resolution mechanism to adjudicate conflicting claims, and utilizes uncertainty-aware escalation for borderline cases. Crucially, our framework supports a Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) contestability workflow, enabling users to directly audit and modify the underlying reasoning graph to influence the final judgment. Empirical evaluations on the LegalBench benchmark demonstrate that ACAL outperforms strong baselines across Gemini-2.5-Flash-Lite and Gemini-2.5-Flash architectures, effectively balancing efficient predictive performance with structured transparency and contestability.

      "abstract_en": "Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by neural networks as well as Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), including physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), physics-informed KANs (PIKANs), and neural operators, are known to exhibit spectral bias, whereby low-frequency components of the solution are learned significantly faster than high-frequency modes. While spectral bias is often treated as an intrinsic representational limitation of neural architectures, its interaction with optimization dynamics and physics-based loss formulations remains poorly understood. In this work, we provide a systematic investigation of spectral bias in physics-informed and operator learning frameworks, with emphasis on the coupled roles of network architecture, activation functions, loss design, and optimization strategy. We quantify spectral bias through frequency-resolved error metrics, Barron-norm diagnostics, and higher-order statistical moments, enabling a unified analysis across elliptic, hyperbolic, and dispersive PDEs. Through diverse benchmark problems, including the Korteweg-de Vries, wave and steady-state diffusion-reaction equations, turbulent flow reconstruction, and earthquake dynamics, we demonstrate that spectral bias is not simply representational but fundamentally dynamical. In particular, second-order optimization methods substantially alter the spectral learning order, enabling earlier and more accurate recovery of high-frequency modes for all PDE types. For neural operators, we further show that spectral bias is dependent on the neural operator architecture and can also be effectively mitigated through spectral-aware loss formulations without increasing the inference cost."

      "abstract_en": "The analysis of non-stationary time-series data requires insight into its local and global patterns with physical interpretability. However, traditional smoothing algorithms, such as B-splines, Savitzky-Golay filtering, and Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), lack the ability to perform parametric optimization with guaranteed continuity. In this paper, we propose Functional Continuous Decomposition (FCD), a JAX-accelerated framework that performs parametric, continuous optimization on a wide range of mathematical functions. By using Levenberg-Marquardt optimization to achieve up to $C^1$ continuous fitting, FCD transforms raw time-series data into $M$ modes that capture different temporal patterns from short-term to long-term trends. Applications of FCD include physics, medicine, financial analysis, and machine learning, where it is commonly used for the analysis of signal temporal patterns, optimized parameters, derivatives, and integrals of decomposition. Furthermore, FCD can be applied for physical analysis and feature extraction with an average SRMSE of 0.735 per segment and a speed of 0.47s on full decomposition of 1,000 points. Finally, we demonstrate that a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) enhanced with FCD features, such as optimized function values, parameters, and derivatives, achieved 16.8% faster convergence and 2.5% higher accuracy over a standard CNN."

      "abstract_en": "Evaluations of large language models (LLMs) primarily emphasize convergent logical reasoning, where success is defined by producing a single correct proof. However, many real-world reasoning problems admit multiple valid derivations, requiring models to explore diverse logical paths rather than committing to one route. To address this limitation, we introduce LogicGraph, the first benchmark aimed to systematically evaluate multi-path logical reasoning, constructed via a neuro-symbolic framework that leverages backward logic generation and semantic instantiation. This pipeline yields solver-verified reasoning problems formalized by high-depth multi-path reasoning and inherent logical distractions, where each instance is associated with an exhaustive set of minimal proofs. We further propose a reference-free evaluation framework to rigorously assess model performance in both convergent and divergent regimes. Experiments on state-of-the-art language models reveal a common limitation: models tend to commit early to a single route and fail to explore alternatives, and the coverage gap grows substantially with reasoning depth. LogicGraph exposes this divergence gap and provides actionable insights to motivate future improvements. Our code and data will be released at https://github.com/kkkkarry/LogicGraph."

      "abstract_en": "A key challenge in artificial intelligence and neuroscience is understanding how neural systems learn representations that capture the underlying dynamics of the world. Most world models represent the transition function with unstructured neural networks, limiting interpretability, sample efficiency, and generalization to unseen states or action compositions. We address these issues with a generalizable world model grounded in Vector Symbolic Architecture (VSA) principles as geometric priors. Our approach utilizes learnable Fourier Holographic Reduced Representation (FHRR) encoders to map states and actions into a high dimensional complex vector space with learned group structure and models transitions with element-wise complex multiplication. We formalize the framework's group theoretic foundation and show how training such structured representations to be approximately invariant enables strong multi-step composition directly in latent space and generalization performances over various experiments. On a discrete grid world environment, our model achieves 87.5% zero shot accuracy to unseen state-action pairs, obtains 53.6% higher accuracy on 20-timestep horizon rollouts, and demonstrates 4x higher robustness to noise relative to an MLP baseline. These results highlight how training to have latent group structure yields generalizable, data-efficient, and interpretable world models, providing a principled pathway toward structured models for real-world planning and reasoning."
