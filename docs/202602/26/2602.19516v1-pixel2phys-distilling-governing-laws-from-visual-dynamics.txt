Abstract 

Discovering physical laws directly from high-dimensional visual data is a long-standing human pursuit but remains a formidable challenge for machines, representing a funda-mental goal of scientific intelligence. This task is inherently difficult because physical knowledge is low-dimensional and structured, whereas raw video observations are high-dimensional and redundant, with most pixels carrying lit-tle or no physical meaning. Extracting concise, physically relevant variables from such noisy data remains a key ob-stacle. To address this, we propose Pixel2Phys, a collabo-rative multi-agent framework adaptable to any Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). It emulates human scien-tific reasoning by employing a structured workflow to ex-tract formalized physical knowledge through iterative hy-pothesis generation, validation, and refinement. By repeat-edly formulating, and refining candidate equations on high-dimensional data, it identifies the most concise represen-tations that best capture the underlying physical evolution. This automated exploration mimics the iterative workflow of human scientists, enabling AI to reveal interpretable gov-erning equations directly from raw observations. Across di-verse simulated and real-world physics videos, Pixel2Phys discovers accurate, interpretable governing equations and maintaining stable long-term extrapolation where baselines rapidly diverge. 

1. Introduction 

Discovering physical laws from observational data lies at the core of scientific understanding and has historically driven major advances across physics, astronomy, and the natural sciences [1, 7, 39, 44]. As AI systems increasingly participate in scientific workflows [28, 48], the ability to infer governing equations directly from visual observations becomes a critical step toward genuine AI for Science.

man scientists typically achieve such discoveries by dis-tilling structured, low-dimensional physical variables from complex visual phenomena and formulating compact sym-bolic laws [9, 32]. However, this manual process is slow and labor-intensive, classic examples such as translating Tycho Brahe’s astronomical measurements into Kepler’s laws re-quired decades of expert reasoning. Automating this capa-bility, visual equation discovery , would therefore accelerate scientific progress. However, visual equation discovery is extremely chal-lenging because the true physical signals in a video are low-dimensional and concise, yet they are submerged within a large amount of visually irrelevant content such as textures, lighting variations, and background motion []. These redun-dant components dominate the pixel space and obscure the compact physical structure that scientific laws depend on. Prior approaches have attempted to address this difficulty in several ways, but each faces fundamental limitations. (1) Supervised equation–prediction models [2, 24, 35, 48]: learn to directly predict equation from videos, but they require manually organzied equation–video data pairs for training, which are extremely scarce, causing the models to generalize poorly beyond the specific systems they were trained on. (2) Unsupervised latent-coding methods: first learn latent representations from videos using autoencod-ing or predictive objectives [5, 15–17, 25, 46], and then ap-ply symbolic regression on these latents. However, because the latent spaces are determined by reconstruction or next-frame prediction optimization process rather than physical structure, they are often non-unique and easily entangle visually salient but physically irrelevant factors. (3) Re-cent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) com-bine visual understanding with strong symbolic reasoning, suggesting potential for equation discovery [3, 4, 26]. Yet directly prompting an MLLM mainly retrieves and recom-bines prior knowledge from its training corpus; without a structured workflow, it struggles to infer new physical vari-ables or derive laws purely from raw visual data. These challenges highlight the need for a method that can reli-ably extract the physically meaningful structure hidden in-

side high-dimensional videos and support the discovery of new equations. To address these challenges, we propose Pixel2Phys, a collaborative multi-agent framework that can be paired with any MLLM and organizes visual equation discovery into a structured, iterative scientific workflow (Figure 2a). At the center of the framework is the Plan Agent, which coordinates three specialized agents, the Variable Agent, the Equation Agent, and the Experiment Agent, and deter-mines the refinement strategy across iterations. The Vari-able Agent extracts physical quantities from videos through several complementary defined tools that correspond to different classes of physical systems, enabling it to re-cover object-level motion, field-level evolution, and other low-dimensional structures that often underlie governing equations. The Equation Agent forms equation candidates by dynamically utilizing symbolic regression components, such as adjusting sparsity constraint strength or selecting different symbolic libraries. The Experiment Agent eval-uates each candidate equation by several metrics, such as simulating its predicted dynamics, measuring reconstruc-tion discrepancies, testing temporal extrapolation, and sum-marizing these results into a structured report for the Plan Agent. The Plan Agent integrates these reports and issues targeted instructions, such as enforcing stronger sparsity in the Equation Agent or requiring the Variable Agent to in-corporate dynamical constraints, for a next refinement step. Through this iterative cycle of hypothesis formation, evalu-ation, and adjustment, Pixel2Phys progressively filters away visually irrelevant factors and converges toward variables and equations that best describe the true underlying dynam-ics. Crucially, each step in this workflow is mechanical and fully within the execution capabilities of modern MLLMs, allowing Pixel2Phys to combine the model’s strong single-step reasoning with structured multi-step coordination, and thereby to discover new variables and governing equa-tions beyond what is present in the model’s training data. We evaluate our framework on three categories of physics videos with increasing difficulty. The results demonstrate that by distilling accurate and interpretable governing equa-tions, our proposed framework improves extrapolation ac-curacy (RMSE) by 45.35% over baselines. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: • We propose a novel multi-agent framework for visual equation discovery, where an MLLM planner coordinates specialized agents to parse complex visual dynamics at multiple granularities. • We design an iterative, co-optimization reasoning process that breaks the circular dependency between visual repre-sentation learning and law discovery. • Extensive experiments on three challenging categories of physics videos demonstrate that our framework not only discovers physically interpretable governing equa-tions but also improves long-term extrapolation accuracy by 45.35%. 

2. Related Work 

2.1. Inferring Physics from Video 

Existing approaches generally tackle visual dynamics from two perspectives. The first category focuses on implicit neural dynamics , learning latent representations to per-form future prediction. Modules like Neural ODEs [10, 17] and Koopman operators [5] are often integrated to model continuous evolution. Other works decompose video into PDE dynamics [15, 46] or disentangled representations [13, 47]. While effective for prediction, these methods en-capsulate physical laws within black-box networks, lack-ing explicit interpretability. The second category, physics-informed perception , imposes strong inductive biases. Re-searchers have utilized inverse graphics [20] or enforced rigid body constraints [22] to infer specific properties like mass and friction. However, these methods rely heavily on apriori knowledge of the governing equations, limiting their ability to discover unknown laws from unfamiliar physical phenomena. 

2.2. Visual Equation Discovery 

Equation discovery from video is a nascent field that typ-ically follows two paradigms: (1) Pipeline-based ap-proaches [30, 49], which extract explicit trajectories of ob-jects and then apply symbolic regression. These methods rely on pre-trained trackers and struggle with continuous fields (e.g., fluids) where objects are undefined. (2) End-to-end approaches [8, 41], which learn a latent coordi-nate space for equation regression. However, they face a critical circular dependency : extracting a good variable space requires knowledge of the dynamics, while finding the dynamics requires a clean variable space. Consequently, they often settle for sub-optimal solutions in complex vi-sual scenarios. Our work introduces a third paradigm: 

a collaborative, multi-agent framework. By establishing a reasoning-driven feedback loop, we enable variable extrac-tion and equation discovery to mutually refine each other, effectively breaking the circular dependency and extending discovery to diverse visual dynamics. 

3. Problem Fomulation 

In the task of inferring governing laws from high-dimensional data, the goal is to find a compact and accu-rate symbolic expression. We are given a sequence of high-dimensional visual observations (i.e., a video), {X(t)}Nt=1 ,where each frame X(t) ∈ RD (D is the pixel space, e.g., 

C × H × W ). We assume this video observes an underly-ing, unknown, low-dimensional dynamical system evolving on an intrinsic manifold [8], Z ⊆ Rd, where d ≪ D. Our goal is to simultaneously discover both the intrinsic phys-ical variables z(t) ∈ Z and their symbolic governing law 

f , which defines the system’s evolution, dz dt = f (z(t)) .This presents a challenging dual discovery problem, as both the coordinate system z and the function f are unknown. This problem can be decomposed into two coupled sub-problems: • Physical Variable Extraction. Learning an encoder 

ϕ : RD → Rd that maps the high-dimensional visual observation X(t) to its corresponding intrinsic physical state z(t) = ϕ(X(t)) . To ensure z(t) is an informative representation, this component often includes a decoder 

ψ : Rd → RD , used to enforce a reconstruction con-straint X(t) ≈ ψ(z(t)) .• Governing Law Distillation. Identifying an inter-pretable, symbolic expression for the dynamics function 

f from a library of candidate functions Θ (e.g., polynomi-als, trigonometric terms). This function must accurately model the evolution of the extracted variables z(t).The synergy between these components is the central chal-lenge. The quality of the extracted variables z = ϕ(X) di-rectly dictates the simplicity and accuracy of the distilled law f . Conversely, a simple and sparse law f provides a powerful signal to guide the variable extraction process 

ϕ, compelling it to filter out dynamically irrelevant visual components. Our framework is designed to solve this co-optimization problem, seeking a self-consistent pair of an intrinsic variable space Z and its symbolic law f that fit the observed data and generalize for long-term prediction. 

4. Method 

4.1. Pixel2Phys Method Overview 

The Pixel2Phys framework mimics the collaborative work-flow of a human scientific team to solve the dual discov-ery problem defined in Section 3, involving observing, hy-pothesizing, experimenting, and refining. As illustrated in Figure 2, Pixel2Phys consists of four agents with distinct roles: The Plan Agent acts as the team’s central coordi-nator, responsible for setting goals, analyzing reports, di-agnosing bottlenecks, and providing instructional prompts 

Iplan to other agents to guide the next iteration. The Vari-able Agent executes visual parsing tasks, i.e., parsing and extracting low-dimensional physical variables z(t) from the high-dimensional observations X(t). The Equation Agent is responsible for distilling the symbolic governing equa-tion f from z(t). Finally, the Experiment Agent validates the quality of the current (Z, f ) pair. In each iteration, the Variable, Equation, and Experiment Agent are required to return a report (denoted as Rvar , Requ , and Rexp ) to the Plan Agent, respectively, containing both quantitative per-formance metrics and qualitative visual diagnostics for the next decision-making step. These agents are instantiated as MLLMs and operate under a unified protocol where they process visual data X and textual prompts P to generate textual responses MLLM (X, P). Algorithm ?? outlines the pseudocode of Pixel2Phys’s execution process. 

4.2. Plan Agent: Global Planning in Iterative Rea-soning 

Our framework replaces a simple pipeline with an iterative reasoning loop driven by the Plan Agent. This agent is the central coordinator that orchestrates the co-optimization of the variable space Z and the governing law f .The reasoning loop commences with an initialization step ( k = 0 ). The Plan Agent interprets the user’s task and activates the initial iteration, yielding the candidate pair

• Equation Refinement. When Z is deemed high-quality but fk−1 is inaccurate or overly complex, the Plan Agent instructs the Equation Agent to modify its equation search by adjusting the configuration hyperparameters. This iterative refinement loop continues until the Plan Agent determines that Rk

exp satisfies the success criteria (Ap-pendix ?? ). The final (Zk, f k) pair is then returned as the solution. 

4.3. Variable Agent: Variable Extraction from Vi-sual Data 

Given a video sequence X(t), the Variable Agent extracts physical variables z(t) by deploying specific parsing tools. We provide multi-granularity tools for flexible usage to ac-commodate physical information presented at object, pixel, and representation levels. The agent dynamically selects the corresponding tool based on both the video’s visual prop-erties and the explicit instructional prompt Iplan issued by the Plan Agent. Specifically, we provide object-level tools for videos of moving objects, pixel-level tools for physical fields, and autoencoder-based tools for complex scientific phenomena. 

Object-level Tool. For moving objects, such as celes-tial revolution, the Variable Agent extracts the trajectory 

z(t) = [ x(t), y (t)] . We employ visual foundation mod-els for zero-shot object segmentation and tracking to avoid training on specific shapes of objects. Specifically, we uti-lize Segment Anything [23] to segment potential objects in every frame. The agent then filters out static targets, as de-tailed in Appendix ?? , and records the centroid coordinates of moving objects as z(t).

Pixel-level Tool. For physical fields governed by PDEs (Figure 1b), video frames X(t) are treated as samples of a continuous field u(x, t ) discretized at pixels x [7, 45]. Phys-ical dynamics emerge from local spatial interactions. We equip the Variable Agent with the fixed convolutional ker-nels to compute spatial derivatives directly from the pixel grid, yielding operators such as the Laplacian ∆ and bi-harmonic ∆2. Since the governing equation is valid at any pixel, the agent randomly samples a sparse subset of pixels to efficiently collect the spatial operators as physical vari-ables z(t) = [ u(t), ∆u(t), ∆2u(t), . . . ].

Representation-level Tool. For complex scientific phe-nomena, underlying dynamics are often obscured by de-vice noise and lighting fluctuations (Figure 1c). We adapt a novel physics-informed autoencoder to compress X(t)

into a latent representation z(t) = ϕ(X(t)) , ensuring the underlying variables remain as simple as possible. This tool operates in two modes depending on the availability of physical priors. First, when the instructional prompt Iplan contains a governing equation f discovered in the previous iteration, the loss function comprises two com-ponents L = Lrecon + λeq Leq . The first term is the self-supervised reconstruction error ensuring z retains sufficient observational information. The second term represents the physics consistency loss with coefficient λeq defined as 

Leq = ∥F (z) − f (z)∥2, where F(z) denotes the numer-ical derivative via central differences and f (z) represents the symbolic derivative derived from equation f . This con-straint forces the latent space to adhere to the governing equation f , guiding the encoder to focus on physical dy-namics while filtering out textural details and noise. Sec-ond, in the absence of physical information, such as during the cold-start phase, the autoencoder performs only self-supervised reconstruction and functions as a standard au-toencoder. This approach ensures the Variable Agent iden-tifies a latent space Z that balances visual reconstruction with dynamic simplicity. Crucially, it enables the output from the downstream Equation Agent to iteratively refine the extraction of physical variables. Finally, the process concludes by returning the extracted variables z(t) alongside a report Rvar . This report encapsu-lates the specific tools employed and their hyperparameter configurations, such as the model size of SAM and its mask size. 

4.4. Equation Agent: Dynamic Symbolic Regres-sion 

Considering that most true equations dz dt = f (z(t)) exhibit sparsity within a high-dimensional space of candidate func-tions [6, 8], the agent identifies the sparse active terms in this function space through a three-step process. 

Data and Derivative Estimation. Given the discrete time series z(t) organized into a state matrix Z, the agent first es-timates the time derivative ˙Z numerically. This step utilizes the central difference method [36] F(z) to ensure method-ological consistency, thereby establishing the left-hand side (LHS) of the target equation. 

Candidate Library Construction. Subsequently, the agent constructs a candidate library matrix Θ( Z), wherein each column represents a potential nonlinear function of the state z(t) that constitutes the right-hand side (RHS) of the governing equation. The candidate library incorporates the following component terms • Polynomial terms including 1, z, z 2, z 1z2, . . . 

• Transcendental terms sin( z), cos( z), exp (z), . . . .The equation agent iteratively optimizes the candidate li-brary in the following process. 

Sparse Regression and Law Distillation. The discov-ery task is formulated as solving the overdetermined lin-ear system ˙Z ≈ Θ( Z)Ξ , where ˙Z denotes the deriva-tive matrix, Θ( Z) represents the candidate library, and Ξ

is the unknown sparse coefficient matrix. The optimiza-tion objective is formulated as ∥ ˙Z − Θ( Z)Ξ ∥22 + λsp ∥Ξ∥1,wherein the second term enforces the sparsity of active terms. To solve for Ξ, the agent employs the Sequen-tial Thresholded Least-Squares (STLSQ) algorithm [6] (de-tailed in Appendix ?? ). The sparsity threshold λsp is deter-mined via the Plan Agent’s instruction Iplan , enabling active guidance over the parsimony of the discovered law. Ulti-mately, the non-zero entries in Ξ = [ ξ1, ξ 2, . . . , ξ d] are re-constructed into symbolic equations f .Finally, the process concludes by returning the discov-ered equation f and a report Requ , containing the candidate library and sparsity threshold λsp for the decision of the Plan Agent. 

4.5. Experiment Agent: Equation Evaluation and Feedback 

The Experiment Agent’s role is to rigorously validate the quality and consistency of the (Z, f ) pair discovered in the current iteration. It receives the variable time series z(t)

and the symbolic law f and generates a multi-dimensional evaluation report, Rexp , for the Plan Agent. This validation protocol assesses three key aspects. 

Equation Quality. To assess the governing law f , Ex-periment Agent computes two quantitative metrics: (1) R2

score by comparing the numerical derivative F(z) with the symbolic derivative f (z); and (2) Complexity, measured by the number of terms, L0, of the coefficient matrix Ξ.

Variable Quality. The Experiment Agent generates phase portraits of the trajectory z(t) to visually characterize the variable space. Concise governing laws typically mani-fest as structured chaotic attractors, whereas noisy or tan-gled trajectories suggest the presence of significant interfer-ence. This image is passed to the Plan Agent, which vi-sually assesses whether the trajectory exhibits a clear, low-dimensional dynamical structure. 

Extrapolation Fidelity. The agent performs a long-term numerical simulation zpred (t) by integrating the discovered law f from an initial condition z(0) . It then (1) computes the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) between the predicted 

zpred (t) and the extracted variables from held-out future frames zgt (t) over an unseen time horizon; and (2) visual-izes the plots of the predicted and ground-truth trajectories. A self-consistent pair (Z, f ) yields reliable long-term pre-dictions. Finally, the Experiment Agent aggregates all these quan-titative metrics ( R2, L0, RMSE) and plotted figures into the structured report Rexp (see Appendix ?? for structure), a b c dPhysical Trajectories Governing Equations e fLinear Cubic Circular VDP Glider Exp Figure 3.

5. Experiments 

We validate Pixel2Phys on three categories of interdisci-plinary videos: object motion (object-level), physical fields (pixel-level), and real-world recordings of scientific phe-nomena (representation-level). We employ GPT-4o as LLM backbone by default. All configurations for Pixel2Phys across experiments are provided in Appendix ?? .

5.1. Discovery of Object-level Dynamics 

Consistent with prior works [19, 30, 41], we utilize videos of object motion to assess the model’s ability to accurately derive symbolic motion equations from high-dimensional observations. 

5.1.1. Datasets 

We validate on five dynamical systems (Figure 3): Lin-ear , Cubic , Circular , Van Der Pol (VDP) , and Glider .These equations include various characteristics such as lin-ear terms, nonlinear terms, and significant differences in time scales [14], which together form an evaluation bench-mark across different levels of difficulty. Video generation details are provided in Appendix ?? .

5.1.2. Setups 

We categorize the baselines into two classes based on inter-pretability. The first class encodes latent vectors and learns the implicit dynamics, including AE-SINDy [8] and Latent-ODE [10]. The second class explicitly predicts object coor-dinates to infer their governing equations, represented by Coord-Equ [30]. We train on the initial 200 steps and eval-uate using the R2 score on 1,000-step extrapolated coordi-nate trajectories. For AE-SINDy and Latent-ODE, we align their latent predictions to the ground-truth coordinates via Procrustes analysis before evaluation (Appendix ?? ). Addi-tionally, for methods capable of inferring symbolic expres-sions, we evaluate two equation-related metrics: 1) Terms Found: A binary score (Yes/No) indicating if all true terms are correctly identified. 2) False Positives: The number of incorrect terms included in the final equation, measuring parsimony. 

5.1.3. Main Results 

Table 1 and Figure 3 reveal three key insights. First, im-plicit methods (Latent-ODE and AE-SINDy) suffer from extrapolation collapse ( R2 ≈ 0). This empirically vali-dates the necessity of our multi-granularity design, demon-strating that generic representations fail to capture rigid-body physics without explicit object-level parsing. Second, Pixel2Phys demonstrates superior parsimony and robust-ness. Compared to Coord-Equ, our framework significantly reduces false positives and achieves near-perfect long-term prediction, with all discovered symbolic expressions de-Table 2.

tailed in Appendix ?? . Finally, the Glider case high-lights Pixel2Phys’s practicality: although the exact sym-bolic matching is not achieved due to complex trigonomet-ric terms, the near-perfect extrapolation ( R2 = 0 .9995 ) and visual overlap in Figure 3e confirm that Pixel2Phys success-fully captured the underlying physical attractor. Further-more, Pixel2Phys transcends simulated settings, success-fully recovering gravitational laws from real-world videos, despite complex backgrounds and noisy tracking (see Ap-pendix ?? ). 

5.2. Discovery of Pixel-level Dynamics 

In these scenarios, videos represent discrete grid samplings of time-varying fields driven by PDEs [8, 34]. The objec-tive is to capture these pixel-level interactions to derive the underlying PDE equations. 

5.2.1. Datasets 

We conduct experiments on four representative reaction-diffusion equations: Lambda–Omega (LO) [8], Brusse-lator (Bruss) [29], FitzHugh–Nagumo (FHN) [42] and Swift–Hohenberg (SH) [37]. We solve the differential equa-tions numerically as datasets. The details of the data gener-ation are provided in Appendix ?? .

5.2.2. Setups 

Baselines are categorized into black-box neural operators and symbolic regression methods. Models predict evo-lution over 1,000 steps (200 for SH system) from initial frames. We evaluate performance using root mean square error (RMSE) and valid prediction steps (VPS), defined as the duration where prediction error remains below a specific threshold (details in Appendix ?? ). 

5.2.3. Main Results 

Table 2 reveals that black-box neural operators suffer from severe error accumulation in long-term rollout and result in extremely low valid prediction steps, confirming that im-plicit approximations fail to maintain dynamical stability without physical constraints. Existing symbolic baselines also show significant fragility as SGA-PDE and LLM-PDE frequently fail to converge or yield suboptimal fits marked as NaN. SGA tends to overfit due to the unconstrained search space of genetic algorithms while LLM-PDE lacks visual perception and biases towards over-simplified ex-pressions that miss accurate terms as detailed in the full equation list in Appendix ?? . In contrast, Pixel2Phys con-sistently achieves the lowest RMSE and near-perfect sta-bility across all datasets by integrating precise numerical tools within a reasoning loop. Figure 4 further demonstrates that our framework correctly identifies complex high-order operators like the bi-harmonic term to capture the exact governing mechanism. Moreover, our framework scales to complex real-world PIV datasets, accurately recovering 2D Navier-Stokes components (detailed in Appendix ?? ). 

5.3. Discovery of Representation-level Dynamics 

This category involves real-world scientific recordings, which suffer from low signal-to-noise ratios due to uncon-trolled lighting and sensor noise. Consequently, effective physical components are embedded implicitly. The goal is to discover a compact representation space that filters visual noise to capture these implicit evolution mechanisms. 

5.3.1. Datasets 

We collect six videos: four visualizing K´ arm´ an vor-tex streets (fluid dynamics) [31, 38] and two record-ing Belousov-Zhabotinsky reactions (chemical oscilla-tors) [18]. Both represent canonical complex systems governed by low-dimensional attractors but manifested through high-dimensional, noisy visual patterns. All videos are cropped and converted to grayscale (details in Ap-pendix ?? ). 

5.3.2. Setups 

We benchmark against FNO, Latent-ODE, and the ad-vanced video generation model Wan2.2 [43]. Given the limited sequence length (fewer than 300 frames), models are trained on the full sequence and evaluated on their abil-ity to autoregressively reconstruct the entire video from the first frame. For Wan2.2, we freeze pretrained weights and use GPT-4o to generate descriptive text prompts for con-ditioning. In addition to RMSE, we also used vorticity er-ror [21] to evaluate the accuracy of vorticity, whose formula is shown in Appendix ?? .

5.3.3. Main Results 

Figure 6 presents a compelling comparison where the 14B-parameter Wan2.2 generates visually realistic textures, it fails to maintain dynamical consistency, evidenced by the spatial drift of vortices at 1.5s and 2.0s relative to the ground truth. This stems from the qualitative nature of gen-erative prompts (see Appendix ?? ), whereas Pixel2Phys dis-tills quantitative governing laws (e.g., eigenvalues λ2,3 ≈±2.136 i in Figure 1c) that dictate a strict oscillation pe-riod ( T ≈ 0.294 ) to ensure precise alignment. Visually, our predictions appear less textured, which is attributed to the selective filtering of the co-optimization mechanism. Ir-relevant components like uneven lighting are discarded to extract pure dynamics on the intrinsic manifold. This phys-ical fidelity is further corroborated by the quantitative re-sults in Figure 5, where Pixel2Phys consistently achieves the lowest prediction error, confirming that the discovered parsimonious law successfully captures the dominant high-dimensional behavior despite the filtration of visual noise.

5.4. Ablation Study and Robustness 

To verify the necessity of co-optimization, we replace the Plan Agent with a static serial workflow. As detailed in Appendix ?? , the absence of the equation feedback loop results in a highly rugged variable space, failing to distill parsimonious laws. We further test robustness by substitut-ing the LLM backbone with smaller-scale models. Results in Appendix ?? show that Pixel2Phys maintains superior accuracy even with limited reasoning capacity, demonstrat-ing that our collaborative agentic architecture effectively re-duces the dependence on raw model scale. Finally, detailed case studies visualizing the step-by-step reasoning process for each video category are provided in Appendix ?? .

6. Conclusion 

In this work, we present Pixel2Phys, a framework that au-tomates the discovery of governing laws from visual dy-namics. By coordinating specialized agents, our approach replaces static pipelines with an iterative co-optimization process. Crucially, it utilizes preliminary symbolic laws to reversely guide visual variable extraction, effectively re-solving the coupling between variable extraction and law discovery. Experiments show that Pixel2Phys recovers par-simonious equations and achieves robust long-term extrap-olation, marking a solid step towards interpretable visual models. References
