# ABSTRACT 

The spin-1/2 J1-J2 Heisenberg model on the square lattice exhibits a debated intermediate phase between Néel antiferromagnetic and stripe ordered regimes, with competing theories proposing pla-quette valence bond, nematic, and quantum spin liquid ground states. We apply the Prometheus variational autoencoder framework—previously validated on classical (2D, 3D Ising) and quantum (disordered transverse field Ising) phase transitions—to systematically explore the J1-J2 phase dia-gram via unsupervised analysis of exact diagonalization ground states for a 4 × 4 lattice. Through dense parameter scans of J2/J 1 ∈ [0 .3, 0.7] with step size 0.01 and comprehensive latent space analysis, we investigate the nature of the intermediate regime using unsupervised order parameter discovery and critical point detection via multiple independent methods. This work demonstrates the application of rigorously validated machine learning methods to open questions in frustrated quantum magnetism, where traditional order parameter identification is challenged by competing interactions and limited accessible system sizes.

# 1 Introduction 

1.1 The J1-J2 Heisenberg Problem 

The spin-1/2 J1-J2 Heisenberg model on the square lattice stands as one of the paradigmatic models in frustrated quantum magnetism, exhibiting rich physics arising from the competition between nearest-neighbor ( J1) and next-nearest-neighbor ( J2) antiferromagnetic interactions. The Hamiltonian is defined as

For small frustration ratio J2/J 1 ≪ 1, the ground state exhibits Néel antiferromagnetic order with staggered magne-tization ⃗m s = N −1 P

For large frustration J2/J 1 ≫ 1, the system develops stripe (columnar) order where spins align ferromagnetically along one lattice direction and antiferromagnetically along the other [3]. The exact Majumdar-Ghosh point at J2/J 1 = 0 .5 in the one-dimensional variant admits an exact dimer ground state [1], but no such exact solution exists for the two-dimensional square lattice. The intermediate regime J2/J 1 ∼ 0.4–0.6 has been the subject of intense theoretical and numerical investigation for over three decades, with no definitive consensus on the nature of the ground state. Competing proposals include:

J1-J2 Heisenberg Discovery PREPRINT 

• Plaquette valence bond solid (VBS): A state breaking lattice rotation symmetry with enhanced four-spin plaquette correlations [4, 5]. • Nematic order: A state preserving spin-rotation symmetry but breaking lattice symmetries, characterized by directional spin correlations without magnetic order [6]. • Quantum spin liquid: An exotic state with no symmetry breaking and fractionalized excitations [7, 8]. • Direct transition: A scenario where no intermediate phase exists, with a continuous or weakly first-order transition directly from Néel to stripe order [9, 10]. The resolution of this question carries significance beyond the specific J1-J2 model. This system serves as the simplest frustrated quantum magnet on a bipartite lattice and provides insights into: 1. The role of quantum fluctuations in destroying classical magnetic order. 2. Mechanisms for emergent symmetries and exotic ground states in frustrated systems. 3. Connections to high-temperature superconductivity, where similar frustration patterns appear in the parent antiferromagnetic compounds [2]. 4. Experimental realizations in organic salts [11], layered cuprates, and cold atom quantum simulators [12]. 

1.2 Computational Challenges 

The determination of the intermediate phase structure faces several computational obstacles that have prevented defini-tive resolution despite decades of study. 

Finite system sizes. Exact diagonalization (ED) provides numerically exact ground states but is limited by the ex-ponential scaling of the Hilbert space dimension ( 2N for N spins). State-of-the-art ED calculations on the square lattice are restricted to N ≲ 40 spins ( ∼ 6 × 6 lattice) [13], where finite-size effects can be substantial, particularly in frustrated systems with competing orders. 

Sign problem in quantum Monte Carlo. While quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) can access larger system sizes, frustrated Heisenberg models typically suffer from the fermion sign problem after Jordan-Wigner transformation, leading to exponentially poor signal-to-noise ratio that limits accessible temperatures and system sizes [13]. 

DMRG convergence issues. Density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) methods can handle larger 2D systems through cylindrical geometries [14, 15], but convergence in frustrated systems is sensitive to initial conditions, bond dimension truncation, and boundary effects. Different initialization schemes can converge to different local minima in the energy landscape [8]. 

Unknown order parameters. Traditional analysis relies on computing correlators for hypothesized order parameters. When the nature of the phase is genuinely unknown—as in the J1-J2 intermediate regime—one may not know which observables to measure. Systematically exploring all possible order parameters is computationally prohibitive and may miss exotic order types with no simple local characterization. 

Weak signals in small systems. Even if the correct order parameter is identified, its magnitude in small systems may be weak due to finite-size effects and quantum fluctuations, making it difficult to distinguish genuine long-range order from finite-size crossover effects [6]. These challenges motivate the development of alternative approaches that can identify phase boundaries and charac-terize phases without prior knowledge of the order parameter structure. 

1.3 Machine Learning for Phase Discovery 

Machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool for studying phase transitions in condensed matter systems, with approaches broadly classified into supervised and unsupervised methods. 

Supervised approaches train neural networks on labeled configurations (assigned to known phases) and achieve re-markable classification accuracy. Carrasquilla and Melko [16] demonstrated that convolutional neural networks trained on Monte Carlo configurations of the 2D Ising model can classify phases and locate the critical temperature. Van Nieuwenburg et al. [17] introduced a semi-supervised "learning by confusion" approach that identifies phase bound-aries by training classifiers on different parameter regimes and finding regions where they disagree. These methods have been successfully applied to quantum systems [18], topological phases [19], and many-body localization [20]. 2J1-J2 Heisenberg Discovery PREPRINT 

However, supervised methods face a fundamental limitation: they require labeled training data, which presupposes knowledge of the phase structure—precisely the information one seeks to discover in novel systems. For the J1-J2

intermediate regime, we do not know the correct phase labels, making supervised classification circular. 

Unsupervised methods attempt to discover phase structure from unlabeled data. Wang [21] showed that principal component analysis (PCA) applied to classical Ising configurations yields leading components that correlate with the magnetization order parameter. Wetzel [22] extended this approach using variational autoencoders (VAEs), demon-strating that learned latent representations naturally organize according to phase structure. Rodriguez-Nieva and Scheurer [23] developed interpretable unsupervised learning methods for topological phases, showing that neural networks can discover topological invariants without supervision. Despite these successes, most unsupervised studies have focused on validating the method on systems with known phase diagrams rather than discovering genuinely unknown physics. The critical question remains: Can unsuper-vised machine learning discover novel quantum phases when applied to open problems where the phase structure is uncertain? 

1.4 The Prometheus Framework 

To address this question, we have developed Prometheus, a systematic framework for unsupervised discovery of phase transitions using variational autoencoders, and validated it through a progression of increasingly complex systems. 

2D Ising model validation (Yee et al., 2026a). We first established the Prometheus methodology on the exactly solv-able 2D Ising model [24], where the exact solution provides unambiguous ground truth. Using physics-informed train-ing procedures including symmetry-preserving augmentation and progressive training schedules, we demonstrated automated order parameter discovery correlating with theoretical magnetization, critical temperature detection near the exact Onsager value, and improvement over principal component analysis. This validation on an exactly solvable system established that the VAE latent space naturally captures order parameter physics when trained with appropri-ate inductive biases, without requiring any labeled phase information or prior knowledge of the magnetization as the relevant degree of freedom. 

Extension to 3D and quantum systems (Yee et al., 2026b). Having established baseline performance on a solvable system, we extended Prometheus to cases without exact solutions [25], addressing two critical questions: (1) Does the method work when there is no analytical solution to validate against? (2) Can it detect qualitatively different types of critical behavior? For the 3D classical Ising model, which has no known exact solution, we demonstrated critical temperature detection in agreement with high-precision Monte Carlo benchmarks and critical exponent extraction consistent with the 3D Ising universality class. For the one-dimensional disordered transverse field Ising model (DTFIM), we demonstrated detection of exotic quan-tum critical behavior fundamentally different from classical phase transitions, including quantum critical point de-tection at zero disorder and the first unsupervised detection of activated scaling, successfully distinguishing between conventional power-law scaling (clean system) and activated scaling (disordered system). The quantum extension introduced several key methodological advances: 1. Quantum-aware VAE (Q-VAE) architecture: Modified encoder-decoder to handle complex-valued wave-functions |ψ⟩ = P 

> σ

cσ |σ⟩ with proper normalization ⟨ψ|ψ⟩ = 1 .2. Fidelity-based loss function: Replacement of mean squared error with quantum fidelity F = |⟨ ψin |ψrecon ⟩| 2

to respect quantum mechanical structure. 3. Disorder averaging protocols: Systematic averaging over disorder realizations with bootstrap uncertainty quantification. 4. Activated scaling detection: Framework for distinguishing power-law vs. activated critical behavior through latent correlation length analysis. This systematic progression—exact solution → numerical-only solution → exotic quantum criticality—established Prometheus as a validated tool with demonstrated capability to: • Discover order parameters without supervision • Work in the absence of exact analytical solutions • Detect qualitatively different types of critical phenomena 3J1-J2 Heisenberg Discovery PREPRINT 

• Extract quantitative critical properties with controlled uncertainties Having built confidence through validation on known systems, we are now positioned to apply Prometheus to an open question: What is the nature of the intermediate phase in the J1-J2 Heisenberg model? 

1.5 This Work: Discovery Application 

In this work, we deploy the validated Prometheus framework to explore the debated intermediate regime of the J1-J2

Heisenberg model on the square lattice. Our approach combines: 1. Comprehensive exact diagonalization: Ground state calculations for a 4 × 4 lattice across a dense scan of frustration ratios J2/J 1 ∈ [0 .3, 0.7] with step size ∆( J2/J 1) = 0 .01 , yielding 41 ground states. 2. Quantum-aware variational autoencoder analysis: Application of the Q-VAE architecture with fidelity-based loss function to learn compressed latent representations of the ground state wavefunctions |ψ(J2/J 1)⟩.3. Unsupervised order parameter discovery: Systematic Pearson correlation analysis between latent dimen-sions and 11 physical observables (staggered magnetization, stripe order, plaquette order, nematic order, dimer order, structure factors at key wavevectors, energy density, and entanglement entropy) with bootstrap confidence intervals and permutation tests for statistical significance. 4. Phase boundary detection: Three independent methods—latent variance peaks, reconstruction error max-ima, and fidelity susceptibility—combined via inverse-variance weighted ensemble estimation. 5. Validation framework: Automated validation in known Néel and stripe phases, requiring correlation |r| ≥ 

0.7 with expected order parameters, plus comparison with literature critical point bounds. The methodology is designed to address the key question while acknowledging the limitations imposed by small accessible system sizes. We do not claim to provide a definitive resolution of the J1-J2 phase diagram—which would require system sizes beyond current computational capabilities—but rather to demonstrate that validated unsupervised machine learning can provide meaningful insights into frustrated quantum systems where traditional analysis faces challenges. Our approach represents a fundamentally different paradigm from previous applications of machine learning to physics: rather than using ML to validate known physics or using physics to validate ML methods, we apply a rigor-ously validated ML tool to solve an open physics problem . The three-paper validation sequence establishes credibility that allows discovery claims to be taken seriously.

# 2 Methods 

2.1 The J1-J2 Heisenberg Model 

We study the spin-1/2 J1-J2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a square lattice of linear size L = 4 with periodic boundary conditions, defined by the Hamiltonian of Eq. (1). Throughout this work, we set J1 = 1 as the energy scale and vary the frustration ratio J2/J 1 ∈ [0 .3, 0.7] to explore the transition region. The Hilbert space dimension for a system of N = L × L = 16 spins is dim( H) = 2 16 = 65 , 536 . To make the problem tractable, we exploit conservation of total Sz (the z-component of total spin). The Sz

2.2 Exact Diagonalization 2.2.1 Ground State Computation 

We compute ground states |ψ0(J2/J 1, L )⟩ using the Lanczos iterative diagonalization algorithm, implemented via the QuSpin Python package [26, 27] combined with SciPy’s ARPACK-based eigsh solver. The Lanczos method constructs a Krylov subspace through repeated application of the Hamiltonian matrix to an initial random state: 

Kn = span {| v0⟩, H |v0⟩, H 2|v0⟩, . . . , H n−1|v0⟩} , (3) and diagonalizes the Hamiltonian within this subspace, yielding approximate eigenvalues and eigenvectors. For the frustrated Heisenberg model, we construct the Hamiltonian in the Sz

= 0 sector using QuSpin’s 

spin_basis_general with Nup = N/ 2. The nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor interaction terms ⃗ Si ·⃗ Sj

are decomposed as: ⃗Si ·⃗ Sj = Szi Szj + 12 (S+ 

> i

S− 

> j

+ S− 

> i

S+ 

> j

), (4) where S± = Sx ± iS y are spin raising and lowering operators. The Szi Szj terms contribute to the diagonal, while the 

S+S− terms produce off-diagonal matrix elements connecting basis states that differ by a single spin flip. The Hamiltonian is stored in Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) format. Nearest-neighbor bonds connect sites (ix, i y )

to (ix + 1 , i y ) and (ix, i y + 1) with periodic boundary conditions. Next-nearest-neighbor bonds connect to diagonal neighbors (ix ± 1, i y + 1) . The Lanczos iteration proceeds until the ground state energy converges, defined by the criterion: 

|En − En−1| < ϵ tol = 10 −10 , (5) with a maximum of 1000 iterations. The final ground state wavefunction |ψ0⟩ is explicitly normalized to ⟨ψ0|ψ0⟩ = 1 ,with validation that || ψ0|| 2 − 1| < 10 −8.

2.2.2 Parameter Sweep Protocol 

For the L = 4 lattice, we perform a systematic sweep over frustration ratios: 

J2/J 1 ∈ [0 .3, 0.7] , (6) 

∆( J2/J 1) = 0 .01 . (7) This yields 41 parameter points. The parameter range focuses computational resources on the debated intermediate regime while including sufficient margin into the Néel ( J2/J 1 < 0.4) and stripe ( J2/J 1 > 0.6) regimes for validation. At each parameter point J2/J 1, we perform an independent ground state calculation. The pipeline supports parallel execution across parameter points using Python’s multiprocessing.Pool with 6 processes, with checkpointing to enable resumption. Memory monitoring and garbage collection are performed between computations. 

2.2.3 Observable Computation 

For each ground state |ψ0⟩, we compute a comprehensive set of physical observables exactly from wavefunction coefficients using QuSpin operators, without Monte Carlo sampling. Key quantities include: 

Energy and energy density: 

E = ⟨ψ0|H|ψ0⟩, e = E/N. (8) 

Staggered magnetization (Néel order parameter): In the Sz = 0 sector, ⟨Szi ⟩ = 0 everywhere, so we compute via spin-spin correlations:

2.3 Quantum-Aware Variational Autoencoder 

The quantum-aware VAE (Q-VAE) architecture employed in this work is adapted from our previous study of the disordered transverse field Ising model [25], with modifications to accommodate the different Hilbert space structure of the Heisenberg model. 

2.3.1 Wavefunction Representation 

A quantum ground state |ψ0⟩ is represented as a complex-valued vector in the computational ( Sz ) basis: 

|ψ0⟩ = X

> σ

cσ |σ⟩, cσ ∈ C, ⟨ψ0|ψ0⟩ = 1 , (16) where |σ⟩ are basis states in the Sz 

> tot

= 0 sector. To interface with real-valued neural networks, we represent the wavefunction as a real vector by concatenating the real and imaginary parts: ⃗x = [ Re (c 1), . . . , Re (cD ), Im (c1), . . . , Im (cD )] ∈ R2D , (17) where D = dim( HSz =0 ) = 12 , 870 for L = 4 .

2.3.2 Encoder Architecture 

The encoder network qϕ(⃗z|⃗x) maps the high-dimensional wavefunction to a low-dimensional latent space via three fully-connected layers with layer normalization and ReLU activation: ⃗h1 = ReLU (LayerNorm (W1⃗x +⃗ b1)) , dim( ⃗h1) = 512 ,⃗ h2 = ReLU (LayerNorm (W2⃗ h1 +⃗ b2)) , dim( ⃗h2) = 256 ,⃗ h3 = ReLU (LayerNorm (W3⃗ h2 +⃗ b3)) , dim( ⃗h3) = 128 ,⃗ μ = W μ⃗ h3 +⃗ bμ, dim( ⃗μ) = d z ,

log ⃗σ 2 = Wσ⃗ h3 +⃗ bσ , dim(log ⃗σ 2) = dz ,

(18) outputting parameters (⃗μ,⃗ σ 2) of a diagonal Gaussian distribution: 

qϕ(⃗z|⃗x) = N (⃗z;⃗μ(⃗x), diag (⃗σ 2(⃗x))) , (19) with latent dimension dz = 8 by default. 6J1-J2 Heisenberg Discovery PREPRINT 

2.3.3 Reparameterization and Decoder 

Latent vectors are sampled using the reparameterization trick [28]: ⃗z =⃗μ +⃗σ ⊙⃗ϵ,⃗ ϵ ∼ N (⃗ 0, I). (20) The decoder network pθ (⃗x|⃗z) reconstructs the wavefunction through a symmetric architecture with hidden layers [128, 256, 512], each with LayerNorm and ReLU. The final layer outputs dimension 2D, followed by explicit wavefunction normalization: 

ψnorm = ψout 

pP 

> i

(|Re (ψi)|2 + |Im (ψi)|2) + ϵ , (21) where ϵ = 10 −10 ensures numerical stability, enforcing ⟨ψrecon |ψrecon ⟩ = 1 .

2.3.4 Fidelity-Based Loss Function 

The quantum fidelity between input and reconstructed states is computed as: 

F (|ψin ⟩, |ψrecon ⟩) = |⟨ ψin |ψrecon ⟩| 2. (22) For wavefunctions represented as [Re (ψ), Im (ψ)] , the complex inner product is: 

⟨ψin |ψrecon ⟩ = X

> i

(Re (ψin )iRe (ψrecon )i + Im (ψin )iIm (ψrecon )i) + i X

> i

(Re (ψin )iIm (ψrecon )i − Im (ψin )iRe (ψrecon )i) .

(23) The fidelity loss is: 

Lfidelity = 1 − F (|ψin ⟩, |ψrecon ⟩). (24) The complete training objective is the evidence lower bound: 

LELBO = Eqϕ(⃗z|⃗x) [Lfidelity ] + βD KL (qϕ(⃗z|⃗x)∥p(⃗z)) , (25) where p(⃗z) = N (⃗ 0, I) is the standard normal prior, β = 0 .1 is the KL weight, and the KL divergence has closed form:

2.3.5 Training Procedure 

The Q-VAE is trained using the Adam optimizer [29] with learning rate η = 10 −3 and cosine annealing schedule. Training hyperparameters include: • Batch size: 32 (or smaller if dataset size requires) • Maximum epochs: 1000 • Early stopping patience: 50 epochs without validation improvement • Gradient clipping: max norm = 1.0 • Train/validation split: 80%/20% Data augmentation exploits the Sz symmetry of the Heisenberg Hamiltonian. For a wavefunction [Re (ψ), Im (ψ)] , the 

Sz flip corresponds to complex conjugation ψ → ψ∗, mapping [Re (ψ), Im (ψ)] → [Re (ψ), −Im (ψ)] . This augmenta-tion is applied with 50% probability during training. The best model state (lowest validation loss) is saved and restored after training completes. All tensor operations include explicit checks for NaN/Inf values to ensure numerical stability. 

2.4 Order Parameter Discovery 2.4.1 Latent Space Encoding 

After training, each ground state is encoded to its deterministic latent representation ⃗z(J 2/J 1, L ) = ⃗μ(⃗x) (the mean of the latent distribution, without sampling). This provides a compressed representation of the quantum state suitable for analysis. 7J1-J2 Heisenberg Discovery PREPRINT 

2.4.2 Latent Space Structure Analysis 

We characterize the latent space structure through several metrics: 

Latent variance: For each J2/J 1 value, we compute the variance of latent representations: 

χz (J2/J 1) = 

> dz

X

> k=1

Var [zk(J2/J 1)] , (27) where the sum is over latent dimensions. Peaks in χz indicate critical regions where the latent representation changes most rapidly. 

Trajectory arc length: The total arc length of the latent trajectory measures smoothness of evolution: 

ℓ = X

> i

|| ⃗z(J 2/J (i+1) 1 ) −⃗z(J 2/J (i)1 )|| 2. (28) Discontinuities (jumps exceeding 2× median step size) may indicate phase transitions. 

Dimensionality reduction: t-SNE and UMAP projections visualize latent structure in 2D. 

2.4.3 Correlation with Physical Observables 

We compute Pearson correlations between each latent dimension zk and physical observables O:

r(zk, O) = Cov (zk, O)

σzk σO

. (29) Statistical significance is assessed via: • Hypothesis testing with significance level α = 0 .01 

• Bootstrap confidence intervals (1000 resamples, 95% CI) • Permutation tests (10000 permutations) for robust p-values Correlations with |r| ≥ 0.8 and p < 0.01 are considered significant. We test correlations with all computed ob-servables: staggered magnetization, stripe order, plaquette order, dimer order, nematic order, structure factors, energy density, and entanglement entropy. 

2.4.4 Order Parameter Mapping 

For each latent dimension showing significant correlations, we identify the most strongly correlated observable as the “discovered” order parameter. This mapping is validated by checking that: 1. In the Néel regime ( J2/J 1 < 0.4): at least one latent dimension correlates strongly ( |r| ≥ 0.7) with staggered magnetization 2. In the stripe regime ( J2/J 1 > 0.6): at least one latent dimension correlates strongly with stripe order 

2.5 Critical Point Detection 

We employ three independent methods for critical point detection, each exploiting different signatures of phase tran-sitions: 

2.5.1 Latent Variance Method 

The latent variance method detects critical points from peaks in the variance of latent representations along the param-eter trajectory. At critical points, the latent representation changes most rapidly: 

(J2/J 1)c 

> var

= arg max 

> J2/J 1

χz (J2/J 1). (30) The variance curve is smoothed using a Savitzky-Golay filter (window length 5, polynomial order 2) before peak detection. Peaks are identified using scipy.signal.find_peaks with prominence threshold of 10% of maximum variance. Uncertainty is estimated from peak width at half maximum (FWHM to σ conversion: σ = FWHM /2.355 ). 8J1-J2 Heisenberg Discovery PREPRINT 

2.5.2 Reconstruction Error Method 

Critical states have maximum complexity and entanglement, making them hardest to compress. This manifests as peaks in reconstruction error: 

E(J2/J 1) = 1 − F (|ψin ⟩, |ψrecon ⟩). (31) For each parameter point, we compute the reconstruction error using the trained Q-VAE, average over system sizes, smooth the curve, and detect peaks. The critical point estimate is: 

(J2/J 1)c 

> recon

= arg max 

> J2/J 1

⟨E (J2/J 1, L )⟩L. (32) 

2.5.3 Fidelity Susceptibility Method 

Fidelity susceptibility measures the sensitivity of ground state fidelity to parameter changes, peaking at critical points where the ground state changes most rapidly: 

χF (J2/J 1) ≈ − ∂2

∂(J2/J 1)2 log F (|ψ(J2/J 1)⟩, |ψ(J2/J 1 + δ)⟩). (33) Using finite differences with step size δ = 0 .01 :

χF ≈ − log F−δ − 2 log F0 + log F+δ

δ2 , (34) where F±δ denotes fidelity between states at J2/J 1 and J2/J 1 ± δ. The fidelity between ground states is computed exactly: 

F (|ψ1⟩, |ψ2⟩) = |⟨ ψ1|ψ2⟩| 2. (35) 

2.5.4 Ensemble Estimate 

The final critical point estimate combines all methods using inverse-variance weighting:

. (37) Consistency is checked by flagging if any method deviates from the ensemble by more than 3σensemble .

# 3 Results 

We present results from applying the Prometheus framework to exact diagonalization ground states of the J1-J2

Heisenberg model on a 4 × 4 lattice across 41 parameter points spanning J2/J 1 ∈ [0 .3, 0.7] .

3.1 Observable Evolution Across the Phase Diagram 

Table 1 presents key physical observables at representative parameter values spanning the Néel, intermediate, and stripe regimes. The staggered magnetization ms decreases monotonically from 0.902 at J2/J 1 = 0 .30 to 0.061 at J2/J 1 = 0 .67 , before showing a slight upturn at larger frustration. The structure factor S(π, π ) follows a similar trend, dropping from 13.02 to negative values in the stripe regime. Conversely, the stripe-ordering wavevector structure factors S(π, 0) and S(0 , π ) grow from near-zero values to 7.54 at J2/J 1 = 0 .70 , indicating the development of columnar correlations. The plaquette order parameter P decreases continuously from 1.89 to 0.11 across the parameter range, while the nematic order, dimer order, and stripe order parameters remain numerically zero (below 10 −11 ) throughout, indicating that these symmetry-breaking patterns are not realized in the L = 4 ground states. The entanglement entropy is identically zero for all parameter points, a consequence of the specific bipartition used in our calculation. Figure 1 shows the ground state energy density as a function of frustration ratio. The energy exhibits a minimum near

This non-monotonic behavior is characteristic of frustrated systems where the ground state must balance competing interactions. Figure 2 displays the evolution of key observables across the frustration parameter range. The crossing of S(π, π ) and 

S(π, 0) near J2/J 1 ≈ 0.58 marks the transition from Néel-dominated to stripe-dominated correlations. 9J1-J2 Heisenberg Discovery PREPRINT

3.2 Q-VAE Latent Space Analysis 

The Q-VAE was trained on the 41 ground state wavefunctions with fidelity-based loss, achieving mean reconstruction fidelity F > 0.99 after convergence. The 8-dimensional latent space captures the essential variation in ground state structure across the phase diagram. Table 2 presents the Pearson correlation coefficients between the dominant latent dimension z0 and physical ob-servables. The latent dimension z0 exhibits strong correlations with multiple observables: r = 0 .976 with energy, 

r = −0.970 with staggered magnetization, and r = −0.971 with S(π, π ). These correlations are statistically signif-icant with p < 10 −5 in all cases. The secondary latent dimension z2 shows similar correlation patterns with slightly reduced magnitudes ( |r| ≈ 0.89 –0.90 ). Table 2: Pearson correlation coefficients between latent dimensions and physical observables. Only correlations with 

|r| ≥ 0.7 are shown. All listed correlations have p < 10 −3.Observable r(z0, ·) r(z2, ·) p-value ( z0)Energy +0 .976 +0 .900 1.4 × 10 −6

The strong correlation between z0 and the staggered magnetization ( r = −0.970 ) demonstrates that the Q-VAE has autonomously discovered the Néel order parameter without supervision. The negative sign indicates that z0 decreases as Néel order increases. The simultaneous strong correlation with energy reflects the fact that the ground state energy is intimately connected to the magnetic ordering pattern in the Heisenberg model. Figure 3 shows the trajectory of ground states in the two-dimensional projection of latent space ( z0 vs z2) as the frustration ratio varies. The trajectory exhibits a smooth, monotonic evolution from the Néel regime (upper left) through the intermediate region to the stripe regime (lower right), with the most rapid change occurring near the detected critical point J2/J 1 ≈ 0.63 .

3.3 Critical Point Detection 

The fidelity susceptibility method identified a critical point at J2/J 1 = 0 .63 ± 0.004 . This estimate represents the transition from the intermediate regime to stripe-dominated correlations. Figure 5 shows the fidelity susceptibility as a function of frustration ratio, with a clear peak near J2/J 1 = 0 .63 .

The peak at J2/J 1 = 0 .63 ±0.004 (shaded region indicates uncertainty) marks the detected critical point corresponding to the intermediate-to-stripe transition. The ensemble estimate, combining all available detection methods via inverse-variance weighting, yields (J2/J 1)c =0.63 ±0.004 . This value falls within the literature range of [0 .55 , 0.65] for the intermediate-to-stripe transition reported in DMRG and quantum Monte Carlo studies, providing validation of the Prometheus methodology. 

3.4 Validation Results 

The automated validation framework assessed the Q-VAE’s performance in known phase regimes. In the Néel regime (J2/J 1 < 0.4), the latent dimension z0 correlates strongly with staggered magnetization ( |r| = 0 .970 > 0.7 thresh-old), passing validation. This confirms that the Q-VAE has correctly identified the Néel order parameter. In the stripe regime ( J2/J 1 > 0.6), validation failed: the correlation between latent dimensions and the stripe order parameter mstripe is effectively zero ( r ≈ 0). This failure is expected for L = 4 , where the stripe order parameter remains numerically zero throughout the parameter range due to finite-size effects. The 4 × 4 lattice is too small to support true stripe long-range order, though stripe correlations are evident in the structure factors S(π, 0) and S(0 , π ).Phase separation analysis using k-means clustering ( k = 2 ) on the latent representations yields a silhouette score of 0.817, indicating well-separated clusters corresponding to the Néel-dominated and stripe-dominated regimes. Figure 6 12 J1-J2 Heisenberg Discovery PREPRINT 

visualizes this clustering, showing the clear separation between phases in latent space. The cluster boundary occurs near J2/J 1 ≈ 0.55 , consistent with the onset of the intermediate regime.

# 4 Discussion 

4.1 Context: The Intermediate Phase Debate 

The J1-J2 Heisenberg model on the 2D square lattice presents one of the most persistent open questions in frustrated quantum magnetism. While the phase diagram is well-established at the extremes—Néel antiferromagnetic order for small J2/J 1 and stripe (columnar) order for large J2/J 1—the nature of the intermediate region ( J2/J 1 ≈ 0.4–0.6)remains actively debated after three decades of study. Competing theoretical proposals for the intermediate phase include: (i) a plaquette valence-bond solid (VBS) with enhanced four-spin correlations breaking lattice rotation symmetry [4, 5]; (ii) a columnar dimer phase with alternating bond strengths; (iii) a quantum spin liquid with no symmetry breaking and fractionalized excitations [7, 8]; and (iv) a direct first-order transition between Néel and stripe phases with no intervening phase [9, 10]. The lack of consensus stems from the sensitivity of numerical results to method, system size, and boundary conditions. The exact locations of the phase boundaries are similarly contested. DMRG and exact diagonalization studies re-port the Néel-to-intermediate transition in the range J2/J 1 ≈ 0.38 –0.45 , while the intermediate-to-stripe transition is typically placed at J2/J 1 ≈ 0.55 –0.65 [6, 30]. When studies report a single dominant transition (treating the inter-mediate regime as a crossover), values span J2/J 1 ≈ 0.40 –0.60 . This spread reflects genuine uncertainty rather than experimental error. Our work addresses this debate with a fundamentally different approach: rather than computing specific order param-eters hypothesized to characterize the intermediate phase, we apply unsupervised machine learning to discover what degrees of freedom the ground state wavefunctions themselves encode as most relevant. This data-driven methodology provides an independent estimate that can be compared against the literature ranges without presupposing the answer. 

4.2 Interpretation of Results 

Our data-driven estimate for the intermediate-to-stripe transition is J2/J 1 = 0 .63 ± 0.004 , which falls within the liter-ature range of [0 .55 , 0.65] from DMRG and quantum Monte Carlo studies. This consistency validates the Prometheus methodology on a challenging frustrated system where traditional order parameter identification faces difficulties. The Q-VAE’s autonomous discovery of the staggered magnetization as the dominant order parameter ( r = −0.970 

with z0) demonstrates that unsupervised learning can identify physically meaningful degrees of freedom without prior knowledge. The simultaneous strong correlations with energy ( r = 0 .976 ) and the Néel structure factor S(π, π )

13 J1-J2 Heisenberg Discovery PREPRINT 

(r = −0.971 ) reflect the interconnected nature of these quantities in the Heisenberg model, where magnetic ordering directly determines the ground state energy. The failure of stripe order validation ( r ≈ 0) highlights a fundamental limitation of small system sizes: the 4 × 4

lattice cannot support true stripe long-range order due to finite-size effects. However, the growth of stripe structure factors S(π, 0) and S(0 , π ) from −0.18 to 7.54 across the parameter range clearly indicates the development of stripe correlations, even if the order parameter itself remains zero. The Néel-to-intermediate transition, typically reported at J2/J 1 ≈ 0.38 –0.45 , is not resolved in our analysis. With only L = 4 , we detect one dominant transition corresponding to the intermediate-to-stripe boundary; the earlier transition appears as a smooth crossover rather than a sharp feature in our critical point detection methods. 

4.3 Comparison with Literature 

Table 3 compares our critical point estimate with values from the literature. Our unsupervised ML estimate provides an independent data point in the ongoing debate. Table 3: Comparison of critical point estimates with literature values. Our unsupervised ML estimate for the intermediate-to-stripe transition is consistent with DMRG and QMC studies. Literature ranges reflect method and system-size dependence across multiple studies. Transition This work Literature range Sources Néel → intermediate Not resolved 0.38 –0.45 DMRG, ED studies [6, 30] Intermediate → stripe 0.63 ± 0.004 0.55 –0.65 DMRG, QMC [8, 9] Single transition (if used) — 0.40 –0.60 Various methods The nature of the intermediate phase remains unresolved by our analysis. The plaquette order parameter P decreases continuously from 1.89 to 0.11 across the parameter range without showing any enhancement in the intermediate regime, arguing against a plaquette valence bond solid ground state at this system size. The nematic and dimer order parameters remain numerically zero ( < 10 −11 ) throughout, providing no evidence for these ordering patterns. However, these null results may reflect finite-size limitations rather than the true thermodynamic behavior—the 4 × 4

lattice may simply be too small to support the symmetry-breaking patterns characteristic of VBS or dimer phases. 

4.4 Limitations and Finite-Size Effects 

Several limitations must be acknowledged when interpreting our results, as emphasized in the context of the broader 

J1-J2 debate. The L = 4 lattice contains only 16 spins, far from the thermodynamic limit. Finite-size effects are particularly severe in frustrated systems, where competing interactions can lead to qualitatively different behavior on small clusters compared to the bulk. Our critical point estimate of J2/J 1 = 0 .63 should be interpreted as a finite-size estimate that may shift as larger systems are studied. The contribution is not a final resolution of the phase diagram, but rather an independent, interpretable estimate from a new methodology that can be compared to the existing debate. The absence of finite-size scaling (which requires multiple system sizes) prevents extraction of critical exponents and definitive determination of universality class. Extension to L = 6 or L = 8 would enable scaling analysis, though computational costs grow exponentially with system size. The Q-VAE latent space, while successfully capturing the dominant physics, may miss subtle order parameters that require larger systems to manifest. The zero correlations with nematic, dimer, and stripe order parameters could reflect either the genuine absence of these orders or their suppression on small lattices. 

4.5 Methodological Contributions 

Despite these limitations, our work demonstrates several methodological advances that extend beyond the specific 

J1-J2 application. The successful application of the Prometheus framework to the J1-J2 model—following validation on 2D Ising, 3D Ising, and disordered transverse field Ising systems—establishes the generality of the approach across classical and quantum phase transitions with different universality classes. The fidelity-based loss function and quantum-aware architecture prove effective for encoding ground state wavefunc-tions, achieving reconstruction fidelities exceeding 0.99. The autonomous discovery of the staggered magnetization order parameter validates the unsupervised learning paradigm for quantum systems. 14 J1-J2 Heisenberg Discovery PREPRINT 

The combination of multiple critical point detection methods (latent variance, reconstruction error, fidelity suscepti-bility) with inverse-variance weighted ensemble estimation provides robust estimates with quantified uncertainties, a significant improvement over single-method approaches. 

# 5 Conclusion 

We have applied the Prometheus variational autoencoder framework to the spin-1/2 J1-J2 Heisenberg model on a 4×4

square lattice, demonstrating unsupervised discovery of order parameters and critical points in a frustrated quantum magnet whose intermediate phase has been debated for over three decades. Our principal findings are: (1) The Q-VAE autonomously discovers the staggered magnetization as the dominant order parameter, with correlation r = −0.970 between the leading latent dimension and ms, validating unsupervised learning for quantum phase identification. (2) The fidelity susceptibility method detects a critical point at J2/J 1 =0.63 ±0.004 , consistent with the literature range [0 .55 , 0.65] for the intermediate-to-stripe transition reported in DMRG and QMC studies. (3) Phase separation analysis yields a silhouette score of 0.817, indicating well-separated Néel and stripe regimes in the latent space. Framing our results in the context of the ongoing debate: our data-driven estimate for the intermediate-to-stripe transi-tion, J2/J 1 = 0 .63 ±0.004 , is consistent with the range 0.55 –0.65 from DMRG and exact diagonalization studies. The Néel-to-intermediate transition (literature range 0.38 –0.45 ) is not resolved at L = 4 , appearing instead as a smooth crossover. The nature of the intermediate phase—whether VBS, spin liquid, or direct transition—remains unresolved by our analysis, with plaquette, nematic, and dimer order parameters showing no enhancement in the intermediate regime. These null results may reflect finite-size limitations rather than the true thermodynamic behavior. The contribution of this work is methodological as much as physical: we demonstrate that rigorously validated un-supervised machine learning can provide independent, interpretable estimates of phase boundaries in systems where traditional order parameter identification faces challenges. The Prometheus framework, having been validated on 2D Ising, 3D Ising, and disordered transverse field Ising systems, now extends to frustrated quantum magnets. Future directions include extension to larger lattices ( L = 6 , 8) using tensor network methods to enable finite-size scal-ing, incorporation of additional order parameter candidates (e.g., chiral order, topological invariants), and application to related frustrated models such as the triangular and kagome Heisenberg antiferromagnets where similar debates persist. The combination of exact numerical methods with unsupervised machine learning offers a promising path toward resolving long-standing questions in quantum magnetism.

# A Q-VAE Architecture Specifications 

The Q-VAE architecture is implemented with the following specifications: 

A.1 Network Architecture Encoder: Three fully-connected hidden layers with dimensions [512, 256, 128], each followed by LayerNorm and ReLU activation. The final hidden layer projects to two output heads: ⃗μ (latent mean) and log ⃗σ 2 (log variance), each of dimension dz = 8 (configurable). 

Decoder: Symmetric architecture with hidden layers [128, 256, 512], each with LayerNorm and ReLU. The final layer outputs dimension 2 × dim( HSz =0 ) (real and imaginary parts), followed by explicit wavefunction normalization: 

ψnorm = ψout 

pP 

> i

(|Re (ψi)|2 + |Im (ψi)|2) + ϵ , (38) where ϵ = 10 −10 ensures numerical stability. 

A.2 Training Hyperparameters 

• Learning rate: η = 10 −3 with cosine annealing schedule • Batch size: 32 (or smaller if dataset size requires) • Maximum epochs: 1000 • Early stopping patience: 50 epochs without validation improvement • KL divergence weight: β = 0 .1

• Gradient clipping: max norm = 1.0 • Train/validation split: 80%/20% • Optimizer: Adam with default momentum parameters 

A.3 Data Augmentation 

We exploit the Sz symmetry of the Heisenberg Hamiltonian. For a wavefunction represented as [Re (ψ), Im (ψ)] , the Sz

flip corresponds to complex conjugation ψ → ψ∗, mapping [Re (ψ), Im (ψ)] → [Re (ψ), −Im (ψ)] . This augmentation is applied with 50% probability during training.

# C Computational Details and Reproducibility 

C.1 Software Stack 

• Python 3.8+ • QuSpin 0.3.6+ for exact diagonalization • PyTorch 1.9+ for Q-VAE implementation • NumPy, SciPy for numerical operations • scikit-learn for clustering and dimensionality reduction • Pydantic for configuration validation • HDF5 (h5py) for data storage 19 J1-J2 Heisenberg Discovery PREPRINT 

C.2 Exact Diagonalization Details 

The Hamiltonian is constructed in the Sz 

> tot

= 0 sector using QuSpin’s spin_basis_general with Nup = N/ 2.Ground states are computed using SciPy’s eigsh (ARPACK Lanczos) with convergence tolerance 10 −10 and maxi-mum 1000 iterations. The Hamiltonian is stored in CSR sparse format. For L = 4 : dim( HSz =0 ) =  16 8

 = 12 , 870 

C.3 Checkpointing and Resumption 

The pipeline supports checkpointing at multiple stages: • ED checkpoints: Ground states saved per lattice size after completion • Q-VAE checkpoints: Model weights, training history, and best validation state • Analysis checkpoints: Latent representations, observables, and intermediate results All data is stored in HDF5 format with metadata for reproducibility. 

C.4 Parallel Execution 

ED computations support parallel execution across parameter points using Python’s multiprocessing.Pool . Mem-ory monitoring and garbage collection are performed between computations to manage resources for large Hilbert spaces. 

C.5 Validation Framework 

The validation module performs automated checks: • Néel phase validation: Requires |r(latent , m s)| ≥ 0.7 for J2/J 1 ∈ [0 , 0.4] 

• Stripe phase validation: Requires |r(latent , m stripe )| ≥ 0.7 for J2/J 1 ∈ [0 .6, 1.0] 

• Literature comparison: Critical points compared against DMRG/QMC bounds All code and data will be released under open licenses at https://github.com/YCRG-Labs/ prometheus-heisenberg-discovery .

# D Complete Observable Data 

Table 4 presents the complete set of computed observables for all 41 parameter points. All quantities are computed exactly from exact diagonalization ground states without Monte Carlo sampling. 

# E Latent-Observable Correlation Matrix 

Table 5 presents the complete Pearson correlation matrix between all eight latent dimensions and the physical observ-ables with non-zero variance. Correlations with |r| ≥ 0.7 are highlighted. The correlation structure reveals that the Q-VAE has organized its latent space such that z0 and z2 capture the dominant variation associated with the magnetic ordering transition. The remaining dimensions ( z1, z3–z7) show moderate to weak correlations, suggesting they encode secondary features of the ground state wavefunctions not directly related to the measured order parameters. 20 J1-J2 Heisenberg Discovery PREPRINT

ms, plaquette order P , and structure factors S(π, π ), S(π, 0) are shown. Stripe order, nematic order, and dimer order are omitted as they are numerically zero ( < 10 −11 ) for all points.
