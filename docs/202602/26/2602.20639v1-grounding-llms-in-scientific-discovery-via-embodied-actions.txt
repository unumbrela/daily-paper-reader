Abstract 

Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown sig-nificant potential in scientific discovery but strug-gle to bridge the gap between theoretical rea-soning and verifiable physical simulation. Exist-ing solutions operate in a passive “execute-then-response” loop and thus lacks runtime percep-tion, obscuring agents to transient anomalies (e.g., numerical instability or diverging oscillations). To address this limitation, we propose Embod-iedAct, a framework that transforms established scientific software into active embodied agents by grounding LLMs in embodied actions with a tight perception-execution loop. We instanti-ate EmbodiedAct within MATLAB and evalu-ate it on complex engineering design and scien-tific modeling tasks. Extensive experiments show that EmbodiedAct significantly outperforms ex-isting baselines, achieving SOTA performance by ensuring satisfactory reliability and stability in long-horizon simulations and enhanced accuracy in scientific modeling.

1. Introduction 

Large Language Models (LLMs, Yang et al. 2025a) are revo-lutionizing scientific discovery, showing remarkable capabil-ities in literature review (Agarwal et al., 2024), hypothesis generation (Yang et al., 2024b; Radensky et al., 2025), and experiment automation (Chan et al., 2024). This progress is driving a paradigm shift in AI for Science, moving from data-driven pattern recognition (Gu et al., 2024) to model-driven autonomous reasoning (Zheng et al., 2025). Yet, a critical gap remains: genuine scientific discovery, particu-larly in process-oriented scenarios (e.g., engineering design (Guo et al., 2025)), requires not just theoretical derivations, but verifiable execution within realistic environments, or via high-fidelity simulations when facing physical or other types of constraints. While LLMs excel at semantic un-

derstanding and logical deductions, their purely text-based reasoning is inherently insufficient to capture the intricate physical dynamics and real-world constraints (Lanham et al., 2023). Without the ability to ground abstract theories and reasoning with observations during executions, LLMs risk producing “hallucinated” discoveries that fail to hold up under rigorous physical verification (Li et al., 2025b; Sinha et al., 2025), leaving a divide between abstractive reasoning and verifiable scientific outcomes (Si et al., 2026). In this work, we focus on LLM-driven scientific discovery in simulated physical environments and explore solutions to bridge the gap. Prior to ours, efforts have been made in this direction via two paradigms: 1) code-as-action , where methods utilize LLMs to synthesize executable programs (Li et al., 2024) to realize scientific computation (Wang et al., 2024a; Ren et al., 2025); and 2) API encapsulation 

(e.g., Model Context Protocols), where simulation functions within scientific software are exposed as services (Jiang et al., 2025; Yang et al., 2024a). Yet, both paradigms fol-low a rigid execute-then-response loop, where feedback is accessible only after execution finishes. Consequently, they lack runtime perception necessary to actively monitor, in-terpret, and intervene during the transient development of a physical process. This disembodiment obscures solutions to 1

intermediate physical anomalies (e.g., diverging oscillations, unstable chemical reactions) that may not trigger immediate execution errors but can fundamentally invalidate scientific results and waste computational resources on doomed trials. We believe a key barrier to verifiable discovery lies in the mechanical decoupling between discrete textual reasoning and continuous physical dynamics embedded in simulations. Bridging this gap requires more than just better code genera-tion or richer API support, but a paradigm shift from passive tool use to active embodied agency .To achieve this, we propose EmbodiedAct , a framework that transforms existing scientific software into active em-bodied agents by grounding LLMs in Embodied Act ion with a tight integration of execution and perception. The comparison between EmbodiedAct and existing paradigms for scientific agents is presented in Figure 1. Specifically, drawing on human cognitive architecture to support this em-bodiment (Anderson et al., 2004), we structure the agent’s functional modules to mirror biological cognition: 1) Strate-gic Planner (as prefrontal cortex) decomposes abstract sci-entific intent into hierarchical executive steps; 2) Primi-tive Generator (as parietal cortex) translates these steps into software-specific simulation primitives (e.g., numerical solvers like ode45 or topological block manipulation in MATLAB) to execute the operations; 3) Runtime Monitor 

(as amygdala) utilizes a runtime perception engine to su-pervise the simulation lifecycle ( e.g., detecting latent risks, execution errors, and intermediate results ) and a reflective decision-maker to align simulation results with scientific in-tent for autonomous optimization. The monitor is supported by our Asynchronous State Synchronization Protocol ,which is built on real-time web sockets to maintain a persis-tent connection between the LLM and scientific software, thus enabling a tight perception-action loop. We instantiate EmbodiedAct within MATLAB, selected for its dominance in scientific modeling and graphical modeling environment of Simulink, providing an ideal testbed for this new framework. Extensive experiments confirm that equipping agents with the capacity to continuously perceive and act upon physical constraints significantly improves solution reliability, stability, and accuracy. 

2. Related Work 

LLMs are evolving from passive chatbots to autonomous agents capable of managing the entire lifecycle of research (Zheng et al., 2025), spanning literature review (Agarwal et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024c), hypothesis generation (Yang et al., 2024b; 2025b; Hu et al., 2024; Radensky et al., 2025), and experiment automation (Chan et al., 2024). To enhance the reliability and creativity of LLM-driven scien-tific discovery, recent work has advanced from controllable prompt engineering (Ciuca et al., 2023) and reinforcement learning optimization (Li et al., 2025a) to integrating knowl-edge retrieval (Xiong et al., 2024) and orchestrating multi-agent collaboration (Ghafarollahi & Buehler, 2024b). How-ever, a critical gap remains between theoretical reasoning and experimental verification (Si et al., 2026). To bridge this gap, recent work adopted the code-as-action paradigm (Gao et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024) that uses LLMs to generate executable code for verification (Jansen et al., 2025), expanding from general data science (Gu et al., 2024) to complex scientific engineering tasks (Boiko et al., 2023; Wang & Zeng, 2025). Yet, existing code-based agents fol-low a “generate-execute-observe” workflow (Wang et al., 2024a), where feedback is only accessible after execution terminates. This disembodiment, lacking runtime percep-tion, is insufficient for process-oriented scientific discovery (Liu et al., 2025; Zhu et al., 2025; Koblischke et al., 2025; Ghafarollahi & Buehler, 2024a; Sinha et al., 2025), e.g., engineering design (Guo et al., 2025) and complex system prototyping (Ren et al., 2025; Liang & Zhao, 2026), where critical failures often manifest during transient evolution (e.g., voltage instability in circuit design or intermediate convergence failure in numerical optimization) rather than at the final state. Similarly, recent autonomous “AI Scien-tist” systems (Shao et al., 2025) used API calls to facilitate discovery (Jiang et al., 2025; Qu et al., 2025). They tend to treat the experimental environment as a black box (Krishnan, 2025), rendering them inadequate for dynamic system mod-eling where continuous perception is essential (Sun et al., 2024). 

3. Methodology 

As shown in Figure 2, EmbodiedAct establishes a closed-loop control architecture designed to ground scientific intent into verifiable execution. In the following, we provide our problem formulation and architecture design in details. 

3.1. Problem Formulation 

We model autonomous scientific discovery as intent-driven problem solving, which can be formulated as a sequential decision-making process within a partially observable envi-ronment E (exemplified by MATLAB software), which is defined by the tuple ⟨S , A, O, C, I⟩ .• State Space S is the latent physical state of the simulation environment (e.g., simulation primitive scripts, variable workspaces, and dynamic model structures ). • Action Space A is the set of executable operations. An action at ∈ A is a synthesized primitive snippet (e.g., 

invoking a solver ode45(...) ) or a system control command (e.g., start simulation , stop ). • Observation Space O: Distinct from standard tool-use paradigms where observations are discrete, static text re-turns, we define observations as continuous streams. At any time step t, the agent receives a streaming observation, 2Grounding LLMs in Scientific Discovery via Embodied Actions

EmbodiedAct orchestrates a fast inner loop driven by the Runtime Perception Engine to trigger immediate Hot-Fixes, and a slow outer loop driven by the Reflective Decision Maker to guide Re-planning.

i.e., ot = {vstdout , v stderr , Ψsys , Ωsim }, comprising standard outputs vstdout , error logs vstderr , system events Ψsys (e.g., 

warnings, interrupts ), and dynamic simulation trajecto-ries Ωsim . Here, Ωsim is the time-series meta-data of the physical simulation, e.g., velocity, voltage .• Scientific Intent I: The natural language description of the high-level scientific goal (e.g., “ Design a PID con-troller yielding a phase margin > 45 ◦”). • Constraints C: A verification function set {c1, . . . , c k}

derived from I (e.g., phase margin > 45 ◦, stable con-vergence ), where ci(st) ∈ { 0, 1} is a binary indicator of whether state st meets a specific physical constraint. The objective of LLM-based scientific problem-solving is to synthesize a policy π(at|o0: t−1, I) that generates a tra-jectory τ = ( a0, o 0, . . . , a T , o T ) such that the final state sT

satisfies all constraints: ∀c ∈ C , c (sT ) = 1 .

3.2. Architecture of the Embodied Scientific Agent 

To obtain the optimal policy π under the EmbodiedAct 

framework, we instantiate the agent with a modular cog-nitive architecture, including four key functions: planning, execution, perception, and reflection. Detailed implementa-tions of these functions are provided in Appendix A. 

Strategic Planner ( Mplan ) Acting as the central planner, this module bridges the gap between abstract intent and executable procedures. It decomposes the scientific intent I

into a set of target constraints {c1, . . . , c k} and a hierarchi-cal plan: (1) Global planning: Conditioned on the intent I

and the current interaction history τ0: t, the planner prompts an LLM to generate a sequence of high-level sub-tasks (e.g., 

Modeling → Simulation → Validation ): 

Pglobal = {p1, . . . , p n} = Mplan,global (I, τ 0: t). (1) 

(2) Local planning: For each sub-task pi, the planner gen-erates a detailed sequence of atomic executive steps based on real-time observations o0: t:

Plocal = {pi, 1, . . . , p i,m } = Mplan,local (pi, o 0: t). (2) Specifically, in our MATLAB instantiation, we ground these steps in software-specific simulation primitives (e.g., 

ode45 , linprog from MATLAB Toolboxes ). By utiliz-ing toolbox documentation as an external knowledge base, we ensure that the planned steps accurately leverage the embedded capabilities of the scientific software. 

Primitive Generator ( Mcode ) This module translates a logical sub-step pi,j into a software-specific executable primitive action at within the simulation environment: 

at = Mcode (pi,j , s t). (3) The generated action utilizes software-specific simulation primitives to directly manipulate the simulation environ-ment. A critical capability of this module is topological reasoning . Unlike generic code generation (Li et al., 2024), 

Mcode is equipped to understand spatial semantics within graphical environments (e.g., Simulink). It maps logical intent (e.g., “ connect the controller output to the plant in-put ”) into executable 2D topological structures, effectively manipulating the graph-based simulation environment. 

Runtime Perception Engine ( Mperc ) To enable the “ac-tive embodiment” central to EmbodiedAct, this module provides real-time latent state inference zt by processing the continuous observation stream ot and the executing action 

at via our Embodied Interaction Protocol (§3.3): 

zt = Mperc (at, o t) ∈ { Normal , Error , Warning }, (4) This engine goes beyond simple syntax checking. Crucially, when zt is Normal , the module focuses on the constraint set 

{c1, . . . , c k}. It actively monitors and records the optimal parameters in environment state st and intermediate results during the simulation process. This is vital for long-horizon simulations (e.g., Finite Element Analysis in engineering design ), where capturing transient optimality is as important as the final result. Additionally, the module parses execu-tion streams to identify potential risks, such as numerical instability (e.g., Inf/NaN divergence ), algebraic loops, or 3Grounding LLMs in Scientific Discovery via Embodied Actions 

stiffness warnings. Upon detecting a constraint violation or an immediate execution error, it triggers a Hot-Fix Loop :

a′ 

> t

← Repair (at, o t). (5) This mechanism allows the agent to not only iteratively cor-rect syntax or runtime errors (e.g., dimension mismatches ), but also drive autonomous parameter tuning to explore for better results without altering the high-level plan, thereby ensuring atomic executability. 

Reflective Decision Maker ( Mref ) While the Perception Engine ensures runtime stability, this module evaluates goal alignment. It employs an LLM-as-a-judge mechanism (Gu et al., 2025) to verify whether the outcome ot satisfies the physical constraints C:Feedback t = Mref (ot, C). (6) Upon detecting a failure where the set of unsatisfied con-straints ∆ = {cj | cj (st) = 0 }̸ = ∅, the module creates a physics-informed update to enter a re-planning cycle: 

p′ ← M plan (p, ∆, Feedback t). (7) Depending on the nature of the error, the cycle activates one of two self-correction strategies: (1) Local Adjustment: 

If the plan is correct but performance is suboptimal (e.g., “Overshoot is 15%, but target is < 10% ”), Mref triggers a local refinement of parameters within the current sub-task 

pi. (2) Global Re-planning: If the failure indicates a basic methodological flaw (e.g., “ PID controller fails to stabilize the non-linear system ”), Mref escalates the issue to Mplan 

to alter the global strategy (e.g., “ switch to Model Predictive Control ”), generating a new task plan p′

3.3. Embodied Interaction Protocol of EmbodiedAct 

To operationalize dynamic interaction between discrete to-kens generated by the LLM ( the Brain ) and continuous runtime generated by the scientific software ( the Body ), we establish an Asynchronous State Synchronization Pro-tocol . This protocol transforms the interaction paradigm through three key mechanisms: • Asynchronous Decoupling and Stateful Sessions: The protocol defines execution as a continuous time interval 

t ∈ [tstart , t end ] within a stateful session. Upon receiv-ing an action at, the environment immediately returns a confirmation message ( operation ack , see Table 9 in Appendix for more message types), decoupling the com-mand dispatch from the execution lifecycle. This allows the session to maintain persistent variable workspaces and operation history across interactions, mirroring the continuous focus of a human researcher. • Real-time Multi-modal Streaming: During the execu-tion interval, a software-side Operation Tracker actively pushes a synchronized observation stream to the percep-tion engine. This stream encapsulates standard outputs (vstdout ), system events ( Ψsys ), and crucial dynamic simu-lation trajectories ( Ωsim ) as state update messages. This enables the agent to capture transient intermediate states 

st′ (where tstart < t ′ < t end ), allowing Mperc to inspect convergence trends or physical violations in real-time be-fore the final result is finalized. • Bi-directional Active Intervention: The full-duplex pro-tocol empowers the agent with active agency . If Mperc 

infers a critical anomaly ( zt = Warning/Error ) from the live stream, the agent is not forced to wait for the pro-cess to crash. Instead, it can asynchronously transmit a high-priority interrupt signal ( astop ) to immediately halt the simulation. This capability enables the Hot-Fix Loop 

(depicted in Figure 9 in Appendix), transforming the LLM from a passive tool caller into a responsive supervisor that prevents wasted computation or later system crashes. Technical specifications of the message schema and state transitions are provided in Appendix C. 

4. Experiments 

4.1. Experiment Setup Benchmarks We evaluate our MATLAB-instantiated Em-bodiedAct agent on two distinct benchmarks: (1) EngDe-sign (Guo et al., 2025): A simulation-centric benchmark de-signed to assess LLMs’ capabilities in performing practical engineering design tasks, spanning nine domains: Control Systems ( CS ), Structural Engineering ( SE ), Signal Process-ing ( SP ), Robotics ( ROB ), Path Planning ( PP ), Antenna Design ( AD ), Computer Vision ( CV ), Digital Design ( DD ), and Miscellaneous ( MIS ). We excluded 9 problems that require closed-source simulation software, resulting in a benchmark of 92 problems. Within this set, 45 problems specifically necessitate MATLAB simulation, while the re-maining problems utilize alternative simulation software. 

(2) SciBench-107: Derived from SciBench (Wang et al., 2024b), a benchmark of collegiate-level scientific problems across Mathematics, Chemistry, and Physics . From the original SciBench, we initially selected a pool of problems suitable for MATLAB simulations. We then conducted a rigorous manual inspection to filter out samples contain-ing annotation errors (e.g., incorrect ground-truth answers) or incomplete problem statements. This yielded a refined subset of 107 verified problems. Details about our data selection procedure are reported in Appendix B.1. 

Baselines and Evaluation Metrics We compare Embod-iedAct with two classes of baseline methods: (1) Genera-tive Models : GPT-5.2&5-mini, Claude-Opus-4.5&Sonnet-4.5 (Anthropic, 2025), Gemini-3-Pro&Flash (Team et al., 2025), Qwen3-235B-Instruct&8B-VL-Instruct (Yang et al., 2025a), which rely solely on textual reasoning to solve sci-entific problems. We employ multi-modal LMs to process visual content within the problem statements. (2) CodeAct:

ates and executes code along with multi-turn interactions and iterative self-debugging. To quantify performance, we employ benchmark-specific metrics: (1) For EngDesign: 

We utilize the Average Pass Rate , which measures the pro-portion of solutions that satisfy all minimum performance specifications and constraints defined in the task description (e.g., gain margin in control systems). Additionally, we re-port the Average Score to evaluate the quality of open-ended engineering designs, where varying design parameters (e.g., response speed, power consumption, material usage) result in different performance scores. (2) For SciBench-107: We report Accuracy , defined as the percentage of test problems where the model provides the correct final answer.

We report the results of our extensive experimentation in Table 1 and 2, and summarize our findings in the following. 

• EmbodiedAct consistently outperforms baseline meth-ods across diverse scientific disciplines. As detailed in Table 1 and 2, EmbodiedAct establishes new SOTA per-formance. Using GPT-5.2 as the backbone, EmbodiedAct achieves an Overall Score of 70.6%/65.4% (Core/Extended) on EngDesign and an accuracy of 48.60% on SciBench-107. These results significantly surpass both the Generative Models (48.0%/51.9% and 44.86%) and CodeAct baseline (55.4%/49.4% and 34.58%). Importantly, this performance gain is model-agnostic, consistently emerging across var-ious model families (e.g., Claude, Qwen3), showing the universal effectiveness of our proposed embodied paradigm. 

• Active embodiment is crucial for process-oriented dis-covery. The embodied paradigm excels in domains requir-ing dynamic verification, e.g., Control Systems ( CS ) and 

Structural Engineering ( SE ). As shown in the Core set of Table 1, with GPT-5.2, EmbodiedAct achieves a score of 68.6% in CS , outperforming the Generative baseline (40.3%) by more than 70% and surpassing CodeAct (50.3%) by more than 36%. Similar gains are observed in SE . These results validate our argument that “cognitive decoupling” is a major bottleneck for existing LLM-based scientific dis-covery methods. While CodeAct introduces code execution for verification, it remains blind to intermediate states. In contrast, EmbodiedAct allows the agent to monitor simula-tion trajectories (e.g., detecting overshoot in control loops) in real-time. This enables the agent to navigate towards op-timal parameters during the simulation process, effectively closing the loop between reasoning and execution. 

• Domain-specific primitives enhance scientific computa-tion accuracy. As shown in Table 2, the average accuracy of GPT-5.2 rises from 34.58% (CodeAct) to 48.60% (Embod-iedAct). The advantage is evident in domains where numer-ical stability is paramount, such as Mathematics (50.00% 

→ 83.33%) and Physics (28.20% → 35.90%). This can be attributed to our Primitive Generator , which translates intent into robust, software-specific primitives (e.g., MAT-LAB’s optimized solvers like ode45 or linprog ) instead of generic, error-prone programs. As a result, the agent ensures that compute is efficiently spent on high-level scien-tific reasoning rather than low-level debugging. 5Grounding LLMs in Scientific Discovery via Embodied Actions

• Robustness across diverse simulation backend. The “Extended” set in Table 1 evaluates the agent’s adaptability to execution backend beyond standard MATLAB environ-ments. Despite the shift to open-source simulation software, EmbodiedAct maintains its performance lead (65.4% vs. 49.4% for CodeAct with GPT-5.2). This shows that our EmbodiedAct generalizes effectively, capable of handling diverse tasks across different simulation environments. 

• Bridging the performance gap for open-source models. 

While proprietary models like GPT-5.2 lead in the com-petition, EmbodiedAct significantly enhances open-source models. For instance, on the EngDesign Core set (Table 1), open-source Qwen3-235B-Instruct improves from 39.6% (Generative) to 57.0% (EmbodiedAct), distinctly outper-forming GPT-5.2 (48.0%). This suggests that EmbodiedAct provides powerful scaffolding, compensating the raw rea-soning disparities of open-source models and enabling them to perform high-capability scientific discovery. 

4.3. Analysis of Reliability and Stability 

• EmbodiedAct shows strong reliability in multi-trial performance. Figure 3 reports the average pass rate on the Pass@3 setting, which evaluates the agent’s ability to yield a valid solution within three attempts. EmbodiedAct con-sistently dominates both Generative and CodeAct baselines across all model backbones. We attribute this reliability to runtime perception, which enables EmbodiedAct to detect potential errors mid-execution and triggers the Hot-Fix Loop 

to dynamically re-calibrate, thereby maximizing the success rate of each solution attempt. Crucially, the performance gap between the Core (MATLAB-centric) and Extended (open-source backend) sets is minimal in EmbodiedAct compared to the baselines. This shows EmbodiedAct can effectively generalize across different simulation engines, maintaining high reliability even in diverse execution environments. 

• EmbodiedAct significantly minimizes performance variance. Figure 4 visualizes the variance of performance by plotting the minimum ( x-axis) versus maximum ( y-axis) scores across three independent runs for each task in the Extended set. Ideally, results should cluster along the di-agonal ( y = x), indicating perfect stability. Quantitative analysis reveals that EmbodiedAct achieves the highest sta-bility: 81.5% of its tasks fall within a narrow divergence gap (gap ≤ 20 ), significantly outperforming Generative models (73.9%) and CodeAct (63.0%). Notably, there is a “Zero Zone” (pink shaded region, where M in ≈ 0 but 

M ax > 0), representing trials where models fail catastroph-ically in some attempts while succeeding in others. Baseline methods show a dense distribution in this zone. Conversely, EmbodiedAct effectively vacates this zone. By utilizing the Runtime Perception Engine and Hot-Fix Loop to mon-itor intermediate physical states, EmbodiedAct prevents divergence before it becomes irreversible, ensuring that the “worst-case” scenario (Min score) remains competitive with the “best-case” scenario.

relying solely on the local Hot-Fix Loop for execution. (2) w/o Mperc , we disable the Runtime Perception Engine :This removes the agent’s ability to monitor runtime states (e.g., streaming trajectories) and deactivates the Hot-Fix Loop, relying solely on the post-hoc outcomes for global reflection. (3) w/o Both : The agent degenerates into a one-shot generator of simulation primitives, akin to a static API call. We evaluated these variants on EngDesign (Core set) and SciBench-107 using GPT-5.2 and GPT-5-minis. The results presented in Table 3 support two conclusions. 

• Runtime perception is the primary driver of verifi-able discovery. Results show that removing the perception engine ( Mperc ) consistently causes a far more drastic per-formance drop than removing the reflective planner ( Mref ). This evidence supports our hypothesis that seeing theexe-cution process is more critical than reflecting on the result.

Without Mperc , the agent loses the ability to distinguish be-tween a theoretically correct script and a physically diverg-ing simulation, rendering high-level planning ineffective. 

• Active embodiment distinguishes EmbodiedAct from CodeAct. A vital observation is that the w/o Mperc variant performs comparably to the CodeAct (e.g., 56.5 vs. 55.4 on EngDesign, GPT-5.2). This implies that merely switching tools, i.e., from generic code (CodeAct) to domain-specific simulation primitives (EmbodiedAct), provides slight gains if the agent remains disembodied. The substantial leap is unlocked only when the tool use is coupled with active runtime perception. Moreover, the w/o Both setting (51.5) falls significantly below CodeAct (55.4), confirming that static tool invocation without iterative debugging (whether textual or physical) is insufficient for complex engineering tasks. Thus, the superiority of EmbodiedAct stems not from better tools, but from the closed-loop cognitive architecture that bridges execution and perception. 

4.5. Case Study: Magnetic Levitation Control 

We conduct a qualitative analysis on a PID controller de-sign task for a third-order magnetic levitation system (see Figure 5). The objective is to synthesize PID parameters 

(Kp, K i, K d) that satisfy five rigorous coupled constraints: settling time Ts < 5s, overshoot Mp < 20% , steady-state error ess = 0 , gain margin GM > 10 dB , and phase margin 

P M > 45 ◦.

Figure 5. Case Study: PID Controller Design for Magnetic Levitation. (Left) Traditional static methods (e.g., Ziegler-Nichols tuning on FOPDT approximation). (Right) EmbodiedAct succeeds via a dual-loop cognitive architecture : the Outer Loop (Top Right) performs structural replanning to resolve opacity, while the Inner Loop (Bottom Right) executes physics-informed parameter tuning. 

relying on static theoretical deduction fail significantly on this task (Pass Rate: 0%). As analyzed in Figure 5 (Left), the classical Ziegler-Nichols (Z-N) method approximates the high-order plant as a First-Order Plus Dead Time (FOPDT) model. This approximation compresses the system’s actual 

−270 ◦ phase lag into a simplified −90 ◦ lag plus delay, leading to severe phase mismatch at the crossover frequency. Thus, the Z-N tuned parameters yield a phase margin of only 32 ◦ (violating the > 45 ◦ constraint) and an overshoot of 35% (violating < 20% ), highlighting the inadequacy of disembodied theoretical derivation for complex dynamics. 

Dual-Loop Optimization of EmbodiedAct In contrast, EmbodiedAct achieves a 100% success rate by leveraging its dual-loop architecture to navigate the solution space dynamically. 1) Outer Loop: In the initial phase, the Re-flective Decision Maker detects a structural flaw: a simple P-controller fails to eliminate steady-state error ( ess ̸ = 0 )for this type-0 system. This triggers the outer loop, where the planner reconstructs the topology into a PID struc-ture. Crucially, to overcome the “structural opacity” of the lumped transfer function where internal states are in-accessible, the agent autonomously decomposes the plant into three cascaded first-order blocks (Figure 5, Bottom Right). This topological restructuring enables the Run-time Perception Engine to directly monitor intermediate states (x1, x 2) via scopes, granting full state observability for precise fault localization. 2) Inner Loop: With topol-ogy fixed, the agent applies physics-informed reasoning by reducing the loop gain lowers the crossover frequency, thereby recovering phase margin. In the second iteration, the agent executes a “Local Adjustment”, refining param-eters to ( Kp = 2 .818 , K i = 0 .8, K d = 1 .886 ). This fine-tuning satisfies all five constraints with comfortable margins (GM = ∞, P M = 69 .66 ◦), validating the efficacy of Em-bodiedAct’s closed-loop cognitive architecture. 

5. Conclusions 

In this paper, we introduced EmbodiedAct, a framework de-signed to bridge the gap between theoretical reasoning and verifiable execution in simulation-based scientific discovery. EmbodiedAct empowers LLMs with continuous runtime perception and the ability to intervene during transient sim-ulation states. We instantiated EmbodiedAct within MAT-LAB and showed its strong potential in handling complex engineering designs and scientific modeling tasks. Exten-sive experiments confirm that equipping agents with the capacity to continuously perceive and act upon physical con-straints significantly improves solution reliability, stability, and accuracy. We believe this work marks a pivotal step toward verifiable autonomous scientific discovery, suggest-ing that future AI scientists should not only reason about the actions but also actively navigate through the dynamic physical environments to ground their actions and plans. One immediate and important future direction to pursue is leveraging the base model’s multi-modal perception and reasoning ability during the execution of problem-solving. Currently the model’s multi-modal ability is only used to understand the scientific intent, and utilizing it to handle the environment’s multi-modal feedback should further boost the framework’s scope in addressing real-world problems. Another promising direction is to equip different modules in EmbodiedAct with different models, e.g., GPT for planning and Claude for primitive generation, which has the potential to create a synergy among different models’ strength. 8Grounding LLMs in Scientific Discovery via Embodied Actions 

Impact Statement 

This work introduces EmbodiedAct, a framework designed to transform Large Language Models (LLMs) from passive tool users into active, embodied agents capable of verifiable scientific discovery and engineering design. By grounding abstract reasoning in high-fidelity simulations (e.g., MAT-LAB/Simulink) with continuous runtime perception, our approach significantly improves the reliability and accuracy of automated scientific workflows. 

Accelerating Scientific and Engineering Progress The primary positive impact of this research is the acceleration of scientific discovery and engineering innovation. By au-tomating complex, process-oriented tasks—such as control system design or dynamic modeling—EmbodiedAct low-ers the barrier to entry for utilizing sophisticated scientific software. This democratization allows researchers and en-gineers to rapidly prototype ideas, verify hypotheses, and optimize designs without needing mastery of low-level im-plementation details. This could lead to faster breakthroughs in fields ranging from robotics to material science. 

Reliability, Safety, and the Simulation-to-Reality Gap 

While EmbodiedAct enhances reliability within simulation environments by catching transient errors (e.g., numerical instability), relying on simulation-based verification intro-duces specific risks. There is a danger of “simulation ex-ploitation,” where an agent optimizes a design to satisfy constraints within the imperfections or specific boundaries of the simulator, resulting in solutions that fail or are unsafe in the real world. Users must remain aware that verifiable ex-ecution in simulation is not equivalent to physical validation. Furthermore, as agents become more autonomous, there is a risk of automation bias, where human operators may over-trust the agent’s “verified” outputs without scrutinizing the underlying physics or modeling assumptions. 

Dual-Use and Misuse Potential As with any powerful au-tomated engineering tool, there is a potential for dual-use. The same capabilities that allow an agent to design stable magnetic levitation systems or optimize flight trajectories could theoretically be repurposed by malicious actors to design components for harmful systems (e.g., autonomous weapon) with greater ease. While our current focus is on benign scientific benchmarks, the broader deployment of such “AI Scientists” necessitates the development of safety guardrails—potentially integrated into the agent’s Strategic Planner—to detect and refuse requests that violate safety or ethical guidelines. 

Economic Considerations Automating high-level engineer-ing tasks may impact the labor market for specialized simula-tion engineers. We anticipate a shift where human expertise moves towards defining scientific intents and performing final real-world validation, while the agent handles the itera-tive computational labor.

A. Prompts for Embodied Scientific Agent 

This appendix documents the prompt design for the four-module cognitive architecture (§3.3). We present condensed templates highlighting key constraints; complete prompts are available in our repository .1

Design Principles. Our prompts adhere to three principles to ensure fair evaluation: (1) Zero task-specific knowledge :No few-shot examples, problem IDs, or ground-truth signals are embedded. (2) Generic capability declaration : Tool-box references (e.g., ode45 , fsolve ) describe general MATLAB functions, not problem-specific hints. (3) Uniform instantiation : All modules receive identical prompt templates across all benchmark tasks in our evaluation. 

A.1. Module Specifications 

Table 4 maps each module to its formal definition in §3.2 and summarizes key prompt constraints. 

Module Output Key Prompt Constraints 

Mplan Pglobal , Plocal Hierarchical decomposition; toolbox-grounded steps; first-principles derivation; validation checkpoints 

Mcode at Executable primitives only; intermediate variable logging; ASCII-only syntax; scope-safe closures 

Mperc zt ∈ { N, E, W } Tri-state classification (Normal/Error/Warning); streaming observation parsing; Hot-Fix trigger 

Mref Feedback t, p′ LLM-as-judge verification; local adjustment vs. global re-planning; physics-informed error analysis 

Table 4. Four-module prompt architecture aligned with §3.2 formalism. N/E/W denotes Normal/Error/Warning states. 

A.2. Core Prompt Directives 

Below we present the essential directives for each module (abridged for space). 

Strategic Planner ( Mplan ) Central Executive 

You are a scientific problem solver. Decompose the problem hierarchically: 

GLOBAL PLAN : High-level sub-tasks {p1, . . . , p n} (Modeling → Simulation → Validation) 

LOCAL PLAN : Atomic steps {pi, 1, . . . , p i,m } grounded in MATLAB toolbox primitives CONSTRAINTS: (1) Use toolbox functions (ode45, fsolve, linprog)---never hand-code numerical methods; (2) Derive formulas from first principles; (3) Include sanity checks for each sub-task; (4) Output structured JSON with problem type, equations, compute steps. 

Primitive Generator ( Mcode ) Code Synthesizer 

Translate plan step pi,j into executable MATLAB primitive at.CONSTRAINTS: (1) ASCII-only code; (2) Log intermediates via disp([’INTERMEDIATE:’, num2str(val,15)]); (3) Assign final answer to result; (4) Scope-safety: pass external values as function arguments. For topological operations: map logical intent to 2D block coordinates (Simulink mode). 

Runtime Perception Engine ( Mperc ) State Monitor 

Process observation stream ot = {vstdout , v stderr , Ψsys , Ωsim } and infer state: OUTPUT zt: NORMAL (execution success) | ERROR (fatal) | WARNING (recoverable risk) TASKS: (1) Parse stdout/stderr for results; (2) Detect numerical instability (Inf/NaN); (3) Extract intermediate variables; (4) On WARNING/ERROR: trigger Hot-Fix Loop a′

13 Grounding LLMs in Scientific Discovery via Embodied Actions 

Reflective Decision Maker ( Mref ) Constraint Verifier                                        

> Verify outcome otagainst constraint set C={c1, . . . , c k}.RECOVERY STRATEGIES: --Local Adjustment :Parameter tuning within current plan (e.g., refine tolerance) --Global Re-planning :Escalate to Mplan for methodology change (e.g., switch solver) OUTPUT: Feedback t with unsatisfied constraints ∆and recommended strategy.

A.3. Baseline Configuration: CodeAct 

For fair comparison, we implement CodeAct (Wang et al., 2024a) following its original Python-based paradigm while ensuring equivalent computational capabilities: • Execution backend : Python interpreter with matlab.engine integration, enabling direct calls to MATLAB toolbox functions (e.g., eng.ode45() , eng.fsolve() , eng.hinfsyn() )• Tool parity : Identical MATLAB primitives are accessible via the Python-MATLAB bridge, ensuring no computational advantage from tool availability • Prompt structure : ReAct-style with <thought> ... </thought> and <execute> ... </execute> tags • Interaction budget : Maximum 5 turns per problem (identical to EmbodiedAct) • Observation : Post-execution stdout/stderr only (no streaming, no intermediate states) The key difference is architectural: CodeAct operates as a single-prompt agent with post-hoc observation, while EmbodiedAct employs a four-module cognitive architecture with real-time streaming perception. 

A.4. Experimental Fairness 

We ensure controlled comparison through the following measures:                

> Table 5. Controlled experimental setup. Both methods access identical MATLAB capabilities; the architectural difference—streaming perception and modular cognition—is the sole variable under evaluation.
> Control Variable CodeAct EmbodiedAct

> Differentiator Single-prompt ReAct Four-module architecture Python + matlab.engine Native MATLAB runtime Post-hoc feedback Streaming observation —Hot-Fix Loop

B. Experiments 

B.1. SciBench-107 Subset Selection 

SciBench (Wang et al., 2024b) is a college-level scientific problem-solving benchmark that comprises 580 problems drawn from 10 undergraduate STEM textbooks that span physics, chemistry, mathematics, and engineering (Table 6). We selected this benchmark because its problems require multi-step numerical reasoning, iterative approximation, and differential equation solving, where closed-form pattern matching fails, and first-principles constraint modeling becomes necessary. A key challenge for method development is that frontier LLMs already achieve strong performance on the full benchmark. Our comprehensive evaluation of GPT-5.2-chat on all 580 problems using zero-shot prompting yielded 75.2% accuracy (437/580, 95% CI: [71.5%, 78.6%]), leaving limited headroom for demonstrating improvements on the overall metric. We believe that systematically analyzing, classifying and addressing persistent failures of the most capable LLMs is valuable to understanding their fundamental limitations and guiding method development. 

Human Expert Error Analysis. To characterize these persistent failures, we extracted all the problems in which GPT-5.2 produced incorrect answers and conducted an exhaustive error analysis with domain experts (graduate students in physics 14 Grounding LLMs in Scientific Discovery via Embodied Actions 50.0%

and applied mathematics). Each of the error cases was independently reviewed and annotated along two dimensions by at least two annotators, with disagreements resolved through discussion. Inter-annotator agreement was κ = 0 .78 (substantial agreement) before discussion; 12% of cases required discussion to resolve. For the computation pattern , experts categorized each problem according to its underlying mathematical structure (Figure 6): application of the direct formula (50.0%), ODE/IVP solving (17.1%), root-finding (10.0%), conservation law constraints (7.1%) and other numerical methods (8.6%). For the cause of error, we developed a four-category taxonomy based on a systematic comparison between the model predictions and the ground truth (Figure 7): • ReasoningError (52.9%): Conceptual misunderstanding, formula misapplication, or answer extraction failures. • ScaleMismatch (35.7%): Predictions differing from ground truth by more than 100 × (e.g., 2.6 × 10 −10 vs 2.6), indicating systematic unit or exponent handling errors. The 100 × threshold was chosen to distinguish unit/exponent errors from numerical precision issues. • PrecisionBias (10.0%): Near-correct responses with 5 to 20% relative error, suggesting a correct approach but accumulated numerical imprecision. • SignError (1.4%): Correct magnitude but opposite sign. The high prevalence of ScaleMismatch errors (35.7%) is particularly noteworthy. These represent cases where the LLM’s reasoning was directionally correct but failed at maintaining proper units or exponents through multi-step calculations, precisely the type of error that tool-augmented computation can address. 

Representative Case Studies. We present three representative cases illustrating our annotation methodology. 

Case B.1: Computation Pattern—ODE/IVP with Event Detection diff 2.3.35 

Problem. IVP: y′ = ty (4 − y)/3, y(0) = 0 .5. Find T such that y(T ) = 3 .98 .

Pattern Classification. This problem requires solving an initial value problem with event detection—the solver must integrate forward in time until y(t) crosses the threshold 3.98. This cannot be solved by direct formula application; it requires numerical ODE integration with root-finding at the boundary. 

Expert Annotation. Classified as ODE/IVP (16.9% of failures). The baseline model attempted symbolic integration, producing an incorrect closed-form answer instead of using numerical methods. 15 Grounding LLMs in Scientific Discovery via Embodied Actions 

Case B.2: Error Cause—ScaleMismatch (Unit Conversion Error) class 2.6B 

Problem. A ball is thrown upward with initial velocity v0 = 20 m/s. Find the time when the ball returns to the ground. 

Model Output. t = 4 .04 s

Ground Truth. t = 0 .68 s

Expert Analysis. The model’s prediction differs from ground truth by ∼6×. Inspection reveals the model used g = 1 .63 

m/s 2 (lunar gravity) instead of g = 9 .8 m/s 2 (Earth gravity), possibly confused by problem context mentioning “gravity.” Classified as ScaleMismatch —the reasoning approach was correct but the physical constant was wrong by an order of magnitude. 

Case B.3: Benchmark Quality Issue—Incorrect Ground Truth stat 1.4.5 

Problem. Given P (A) = 0 .8, P (B) = 0 .5, P (A ∪ B) = 0 .9, find P (A ∩ B).

Ground Truth. P (A ∩ B) = 0 .9

Model Output. P (A ∩ B) = 0 .4

Analysis. By the inclusion-exclusion principle: P (A ∩ B) = P (A) + P (B) − P (A ∪ B) = 0 .8 + 0 .5 − 0.9 = 0 .4

The ground truth 0.9 violates probability axioms since P (A ∩ B) ≤ min( P (A), P (B)) = 0 .5. The model’s answer is mathematically correct; the benchmark annotation is erroneous. This case was retained in our subset to preserve the natural error distribution, but we flag it as a benchmark quality issue rather than a model failure. For evaluation metrics, we report results with these 3 identified benchmark quality issues included; excluding them would increase reported accuracy by ∼2.8% .

Benchmark Quality Observations. During our expert review, we identified several quality issues in the original SciBench dataset that affect evaluation reliability: • Incomplete problem statements : Some problems reference parameters from preceding questions without including them (e.g., class 2.18B states “Include air resistance...in the previous problem” but does not provide the referenced parameters). • Missing domain constants : Certain problems require specialized constants not provided in the problem text (e.g., 

atkins p2.45(b) requires the Joule-Thomson coefficient μ which varies significantly across refrigerant types). • Ambiguous ground truth : A small number of problems have questionable reference answers (see Case B.3 above). • Unit ambiguity : Some problems do not clearly specify units (e.g., quan 17.9 where the force constant units affect whether the answer is 27 or 113 kJ/mol). These observations informed our subset construction: we retained representative failure cases to preserve the natural error distribution, while acknowledging that a portion of “failures” may reflect benchmark quality issues rather than model limitations.

Subset Construction.

C. WebSocket Communication Protocol 

This appendix provides technical details of the Asynchronous State Synchronization Protocol referenced in Section 3.3. The protocol enables the LLM agent to maintain continuous presence within the simulation environment by treating execution as a continuous time interval rather than a discrete function call. 

C.1. Protocol Overview 

The WebSocket-based communication protocol implements three key capabilities that distinguish EmbodiedAct from traditional tool-calling agents: 1. Asynchronous Acknowledgment : Operations are confirmed immediately upon receipt, decoupling request transmission from execution completion. 2. Streaming Observation : The Operation Tracker pushes intermediate states ot via persistent WebSocket channel, enabling real-time monitoring during t ∈ [tstart , t end ].3. Stateful Sessions : Each session maintains operation history, pending verifications, and connection state across multiple interactions. 

C.2. Message Format Specification 

All messages conform to the EnhancedMessage schema shown in Table 8.

C.8. Design Considerations 

The protocol addresses several challenges inherent to coupling LLM agents with long-running scientific simulations: • Timeout and Fault Tolerance : Scientific simulations (e.g., PDE solvers, antenna optimization) may execute for extended periods. The protocol employs a configurable timeout (default: 600s) with automatic state transition to FAILED , enabling the agent to detect stalled operations and invoke recovery strategies. • Concurrent Operation Multiplexing : The operation id field implements a lightweight multiplexing scheme, allowing multiple operations to share a single WebSocket channel while maintaining message-operation affinity—a design choice that reduces connection overhead in multi-step reasoning chains. • Session Persistence : To support iterative refinement workflows, the protocol maintains session state across transient disconnections. The client-side tracker preserves pending operations, enabling seamless resumption when connectivity is restored—critical for unreliable network environments. • Encoding Robustness : Legacy simulation toolboxes may emit non-UTF-8 byte sequences. Rather than failing immedi-ately, the protocol implements graceful degradation: after k consecutive decoding failures (default k=3 ), the operation is marked complete with a warning, preserving partial results for downstream analysis. • Resource Management : To prevent memory exhaustion during prolonged sessions, operation trackers are garbage-collected after Ttimeout + ∆ seconds ( ∆=60 s by default), balancing resource efficiency against the need to retain context for late-arriving messages. 19 Grounding LLMs in Scientific Discovery via Embodied Actions

D. Case Study: Closed-Loop Self-Correction in EmbodiedAct 

This appendix presents 9 representative cases demonstrating EmbodiedAct’s three self-correction mechanisms (Figure 11), each illustrated with 2 successful cases and 1 limitation case. 

D.1. Runtime Perception and Error Recovery Core Value : Detect and fix runtime errors (undefined functions, input/output mismatch) within the same problem episode, then continue solving. 

Case 1.1: Input/Output Mismatch Recovery ✓ Correct 

Problem. IVP: y′ = ty (4 − y)/3, y(0) = 0 .5. Find T when y(T ) = 3 .98 .

Trace. 

iter 0: Error: Number of inputs must match outputs. iter 1: T=3.29527274450143, yT=3.98, T closed form=3.29527274450382 abs diff T=2.39e-12 ⇒ Result: 3.29527 

Outcome. T = 3 .2953 matches GT 3.29527 . Mechanism. Mperc detects function signature error → local adjustment fixes interface → self-verification via closed-form comparison. 

Case 1.2: Undefined Function Recovery ✓ Correct 

Problem. IVP: y′ + 14 y = 3 + 2 cos 2 t, y(0) = 0 . Find t when y = 12 .

Trace. iter 0: Error: Function ‘odefun’ not recognized. iter 1: t event=10.0657784374513, y event=12 ⇒ Result: 10.0658 

Outcome. t = 10 .0658 matches GT 10 .065778 . Mechanism. Mperc captures undefined function error → local adjustment defines missing function → no replan needed. 

Case 1.3: Limitation—Error Fixed but Semantic Extraction Wrong × Wrong 

Problem. Elastic collision: find u1/u 2 such that m1 is at rest after collision. 

Trace. iter 0-1: Errors: ‘nu1’, ‘nu2’ undefined → fixed in iter 2iter 2: selected r=2.414213562, alpha=0.414... ⇒ Result: 2.4142 

Outcome. Output 1 + √2 ≈ 2.414 vs GT (1 + √2) 2 = 5 .828 . Limitation. Runtime recovery fixed execution errors but model extracted the wrong target quantity—multi-round error recovery cannot guarantee conceptual correctness. 

D.2. Local Iteration with Intermediate Variable Monitoring Core Value : Monitor intermediate variables across iterations, pass information between rounds to solve problems without closed-form solutions—enabling parameter exploration and iterative refinement. 

Case 2.1: Iterative Threshold Verification (5% Criterion) ✓ Correct 

Problem. Br 2 vibrational wavenumber 323.2 cm −1. At what T is the partition function within 5% of the approximate formula? 

Key Intermediates. theta v=465.01, T 5pct=4493.795, q exact=10.172, q approx=9.664 rel error at solution=0.05000 ⇒ Result: 4493.8 

Outcome. T = 4493 .8 (GT 4500 , within 5%). Mechanism. System explicitly computed and logged qexact , qapprox ,and rel error = 0 .05 —converting the “5% criterion” into a verifiable numerical check. 21 Grounding LLMs in Scientific Discovery via Embodied Actions 

Case 2.2: Dense Grid Search with Bracket Refinement ✓ Correct (Reflection) 

Problem. Spring-mass system: find τ after which |u(t)| < 0.1 for all t > τ .

Initial Attempt (Wrong). tau=23.3134 (found a crossing, not the last one) 

After Reflective Feedback (Correct). t grid count=200001, brackets tL=25.6772, brackets tR=25.6776 tau=25.6773, settling ok=1 ⇒ Result: 25.6773 (GT exact) 

Mechanism. Dense grid search located last threshold crossing → bracket refinement → settling ok post-hoc verification confirms |u(t)| < 0.1 for all t > τ .

Case 2.3: Limitation—Persistent Script Errors Despite Intermediate Passing × Wrong 

Problem. Rocket trajectory with variable air density: determine max height. 

Trace.                    

> iter 0: total mass, fuel mass, mdot logged; result=8865.56 (unstable) iter 1: Error: Script functions must end with ‘end’ iter 2: Error: ‘node options burn’ undefined

Limitation. Iteration 0 logged physical parameters, but subsequent iterations introduced MATLAB syntax errors. Intermediate monitoring cannot help if generated scripts are syntactically invalid—the model struggled to maintain coherence for this complex multi-stage problem. 

D.3. Answer Verification Feedback Core Value : When Mref (Reflective Decision Maker) judges that the output answer may be incorrect—despite no runtime errors—it automatically triggers a reflective re-attempt with diagnostic feedback injected into context. This mechanism addresses “no error but wrong answer” samples by prompting the model to revise its strategy or correct modeling assumptions, 

without manual intervention .

Case 3.1: Sanity Check Triggered Replan ✓ Correct 

Problem. Model rocket: speed at burnout is 131 m/s. How far has it traveled? 

Key Intermediates. v burnout calc=133.56, x burnout=112.24, velocity error pct=1.95% replan count=1, error types=[ReviewFailed] ⇒ Result: 112.24 m

Outcome. x = 112 .24 m (GT 108 , within 5%). Mechanism. Mref triggered ReviewFailed → replan → model added sanity check comparing computed vburnout with given value to increase confidence. 

Case 3.2: Concept Error Corrected via Reflective Judgment ✓ Correct (Reflection) 

Problem. Clown juggles 4 balls, 0.9 s/cycle. What is minimum throw speed? 

Initial Attempt (Wrong). T flight=3.6 (used N · tcycle ), v0=17.658 (GT: 13.2) 

After Reflective Feedback (Correct). T flight=2.7 (used (N −1) · tcycle ), v0=13.2435 

Diagnostic Context Injected by Mref . Previous Answer: 17.658 flagged as suspicious. Hint: internally consistent but likely wrong. 

Mechanism. Mref judged the initial answer suspicious and automatically triggered re-attempt with diagnostic feedback 

→ model reconsidered modeling assumption (off-by-one: ball must stay airborne for (N −1) cycles) → corrected to 

v0 = g · T / 2 = 13 .24 m/s. 

Case 3.3: Limitation—Systematic Assumption Mismatch × Wrong 

Problem. Barometric formula: pressure at 11 km altitude. 

Initial & Reflection-triggered Attempts. Both: p=0.271 atm (isothermal barometric formula) vs GT=0.72 atm 

Limitation. Both attempts used the isothermal model p = p0 exp( −M gh/RT ) with standard parameters, yielding consistent ∼0.27 atm. The GT implies a different model (non-isothermal or different parameters). When conceptual approach is fundamentally misaligned with ground truth’s unstated assumptions, even reflective re-attempts cannot help—this is a benchmark annotation ambiguity, not a framework failure. 22 Grounding LLMs in Scientific Discovery via Embodied Actions

Key Takeaways: 

• Runtime Perception enables fixing execution errors within the same episode—but cannot catch semantic/conceptual errors. • Intermediate Monitoring supports iterative solving for problems without closed-form solutions—but requires syntacti-cally valid scripts. • Answer Verification Feedback enables Mref to automatically detect “no error but suspicious answer” cases and trigger reflective re-attempts that prompt strategy revision—all within the framework’s closed loop, without manual intervention. However, it cannot overcome fundamental assumption mismatches with ground truth. 

E. Computational Resource Analysis 

This appendix provides a detailed analysis of token consumption across different methods, offering transparency about the computational overhead of the embodied cognitive architecture. 

E.1. Token Usage Comparison 

Table 11 compares token consumption across three paradigms on multi-step reasoning tasks requiring iterative refinement.                  

> Table 11. Token usage comparison on multi-step reasoning tasks. All ratios are relative to Baseline.
> Method Total Tokens Ratio Avg Score Pass Rate
> Baseline (Direct) 104,889 1.0 ×53.3 33.3% CodeAct 657,141 6.3 ×44.0 15.6%
> EmbodiedAct 1,115,740 10.6 ×61.6 51.1%

Key Observations. 

• More tokens ̸ = effective iteration : CodeAct consumes 6.3 × more tokens than Baseline but achieves lower accuracy (44.0 vs. 53.3). For multi-step reasoning tasks, CodeAct’s brief action-observation cycles lack sufficient context to form effective iterative refinement. • Justified overhead : EmbodiedAct’s 10.6 × overhead relative to Baseline yields +17.6 points in average score and +35.5 percentage points in pass rate over CodeAct. 

E.2. Token Distribution by Module 

Table 12 breaks down EmbodiedAct’s token consumption across its four cognitive modules, revealing the computational allocation of the neuro-functional architecture. 

Module-Level Insights. 

23 Grounding LLMs in Scientific Discovery via Embodied Actions 

Table 12. Token distribution by module. Mplan and Mref show similar consumption due to symmetric input contexts and comparable output schemas. 

Module Symbol Input Output Total %

Strategic Planner Mplan 124,764 9,264 134,028 12% Primitive Generator Mcode 601,858 44,778 646,636 58% Runtime Perception Mperc 187,146 13,894 201,040 18% Reflective Decision Mref 123,772 10,264 134,036 12% 

Total – 1,037,540 78,200 1,115,740 100% 

• Mcode dominance (58%) : The majority of tokens are consumed by the Primitive Generator, reflecting multi-iteration code synthesis and refinement cycles typical in engineering design tasks. • Balanced perception-reflection (30%) : The combined overhead of Mperc (18%) and Mref (12%) enables runtime state monitoring and adaptive replanning. • Efficient planning (12%) : Mplan consumes only 12% of tokens, as structured recipe generation front-loads reasoning into a compact JSON schema. 

Verifiability-Efficiency Trade-off. The token overhead represents a deliberate architectural choice: EmbodiedAct maintains rich execution context (intermediate states, error traces, constraint violations) to detect failures early and correct course mid-execution. This investment yields higher accuracy (61.6% vs. 44.0% for CodeAct) and better reliability (51.1% pass rate vs. 15.6%), demonstrating that intelligent token usage—with streaming perception and modular cognition— outperforms blind multi-turn iteration. 24
