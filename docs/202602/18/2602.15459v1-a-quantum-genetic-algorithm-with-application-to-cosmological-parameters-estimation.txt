Abstract 

An Amplitude-Encoded Quantum Genetic Algorithm (AEQGA) has been developed to minimize χ2 functions of di ff erent cosmo-logical probes (Supernovae Type Ia, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation), to find the best-fit value for two cosmological parameters, namely the Hubble Constant and the density matter content of the Universe today. Our main aim is to pave the way to testing the adoption of quantum optimization in the inference of the cosmological parameters that describe the universe evolution. AEQGA computes the merit function classically, and then uses a quantum circuit to entangle the population and perform crossover and mutation operations. The results show consistency with the isocontours of the objective functions. We then tested the general behavior of AEQGA as a function of its hyperparameters and compared it with a second quantum genetic algorithm found in the literature as well as with classical algorithms, finding consistent results.

1. Introduction 

Quantum Computing (QC) is a novel framework linking fun-damental concepts of Mathematics, Computer Science, and Quantum Mechanics (Yanofsky, 2007). The interest in QC dates back to the end of the last century (Feynman, 1982; Un-ruh, 1995; DiVincenzo, 1995; Narayanan and Moore, 1996), although first investigations were mainly devoted to theoretical foundations. In that period, the first quantum algorithms were created, enabling an impressive advantage in terms of compu-tational costs in comparison with the corresponding classical computations, at least theoretically. The Grover’s algorithm for quantum search (Grover, 1998), and Shor’s one for integer fac-torization (Shor, 1999) were some of the first examples. Nowadays, QC is a new frontier that has been rapidly evolv-ing in recent years, attracting significant interest from the sci-entific community (Steane, 1998; Aharonov, 1999; Ladd et al., 2010; Li, 2020). The key idea behind this framework is a fundamental reinterpretation of numerical computations utiliz-ing Quantum Mechanics concepts, by employing the so-called qubit as the information unit instead of the classical bit. The main di ff erence is that, unlike classical bits, which can exist in one of two states (0 or 1), qubits can exist in a linear combi-nation of basis states because of quantum superposition, which collapses once the state of the qubit is classically measured. This property, along with another key concept called Entangle-ment (for which states of di ff erent qubits are interconnected via their wave function regardless of the physical distance between them) allows, on an ideal quantum hardware and for specific tasks fully using these properties, to perform complex opera-tions significantly reducing time and /or computing resources with respect to classical frameworks. This would be partic-ularly useful in specific instances, involving some of the so-called Nondeterministic Polynomial (NP)-hard problems, i.e. operations that can be reduced to NP problems in a polynomial time, NP problems being computations whose solutions can be verified (not solved) in a polynomial time (Cook, 1971). More recently, remarkable technological improvements have enabled the creation of proper quantum computers (Massarotti et al., 2023). This allowed for quantum supremacy to be finally achieved for an “ad hoc” problem (Arute et al., 2019), which has been proven to be realistically impossible to solve via clas-sical computations in a reasonable amount of time. Specifically, from a complex quantum circuit composed of gates layered with 53 qubits, the authors sampled a probability distribution that is extremely di ffi cult to sample classically. This task would have been solved in approximately 10.000 years with a classi-cal supercomputer, while the sampling has been completed in only 200 seconds through quantum computations. These im-pressive gains, however, cannot be generalized, and each class of problems has to be studied on its own. One of the main goals for QC is to improve the underlying

hardware of quantum computers, i.e. finding new strategies to build qubits, the physical connection between them, and a proper classical interface to e ff ectively interact with other hard-ware, while also developing proper quantum algorithms using their properties, finding realistic fields of application in science where this framework can be successfully applied, reaching the so-called “quantum utility”. For a recent review of quantum algorithms, see Montanaro (2016); Dalzell et al. (2023). From a hardware point of view, two main paths (among the others) have been followed by the scientific community, one re-lated to the adiabatic quantum computations (Albash and Li-dar, 2018) based on quantum annealers, while the other on the so-called gate-based quantum computations and hardware (Hagouel and Karafyllidis, 2012). The quantum annealer is a hardware built following the idea of classical simulated annealers, where the system is cooled to adiabatically reach the minimum energy of a specific con-figuration (Somma et al., 2012; Rajak et al., 2022). It spe-cializes in combinatorial optimization problems (Djidjev et al., 2018) by evolving a quantum system toward the ground state of a problem-specific Hamiltonian typically mapped to an Ising model (Kadowaki and Nishimori, 1998). This approach has been followed for a variety of applications (Lucas, 2014; Or´ us et al., 2019), but it has also faced di ff erent challenges related to the hardware implementations of algorithms, even if po-tential improvements on the classical results have been found (Rønnow et al., 2014; Tasse ff et al., 2024). Very recently, evi-dence for quantum advantage for this kind of hardware has been reached (King et al., 2025), even if there are some discussions on these claims, especially on the advantage with respect to classical methods (Tindall et al., 2025). Gate-based QC is instead based on operations applied on qubits via unitary matrices (van de Wetering, 2021), building the so-called quantum circuits whose results can then be mea-sured classically. As this approach is followed in our analysis, more details on this are found in § Appendix A. Gate-based QC is generally more flexible, given that it can be used for a plethora of di ff erent applications (Sachdeva et al., 2024). Given the many fields in which a strong computational ef-fort is becoming mandatory, employing quantum computers to integrate classical computations is of great interest to the sci-entific community. Astrophysics and cosmology, in particular, rely more and more on massive datasets and high-dimensional parameter spaces, whereas traditional computational methods often struggle with scalability and e ffi ciency (Piras et al., 2024). In the last decades, the astronomical community has moved from an epoch of data paucity to one of data richness (Com-parato et al., 2007), thanks to both space missions like Gaia (Ripepi et al., 2023), and ground-based ones like the Very Large Telescope (VLT, Lilly et al. 2007). In this sense, a fundamen-tal observational campaign symbolizing this paradigm shift is the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS, York et al. 2000), and the impressive size of astronomical data it has gathered. To give an idea of the size of astrophysical and cosmologi-cal datasets, data release 17 of the SDSS has a volume of 245 TB, to be added to the total volume of the previous data re-leases, which is equal to 407 TB (Abdurro’uf et al., 2022). This paradigm change will be further exacerbated with the current and next generations of scientific missions, like Euclid (Lau-reijs et al., 2011; Scaramella et al., 2022; Mellier et al., 2025), and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory (LSST Science Collabora-tion et al., 2009). Thus, new strategies that can manage enor-mous databases in a limited amount of time are mandatory. In this context, classical machine learning methods are be-coming more and more common in these fields (Sen et al., 2022), for many tasks like classification (Cavuoti et al., 2014; Brescia et al., 2015; Angora et al., 2020), estimation of features associated with specific sources of a catalog (Laurino et al., 2011; Brescia et al., 2014; Delli Veneri et al., 2019; Razim et al., 2021), feature selection (D’Isanto et al., 2018). For a complete review, see Ivezi´ c et al. (2020). Another important point is the fact that astronomical data analysis benefits strongly from the rapid evolution of classical hardware, like the extensive di ff u-sion of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). From this point of view, fully exploiting these resources requires a general rework-ing of the astrophysical and cosmological codes (Ta ff oni et al., 2020). It is important to note that, related to these classical frame-works, quantum machine learning (Schuld et al., 2014) based on gate formalism is currently being extensively studied (Far-sian et al., 2025a). Also, quantum computations can be intrinsi-cally parallelized, because superposition allows to perform op-erations on linear combinations of basis states (Markidis, 2024). This is the reason why we aim to explore possible applications of QC in astrophysics, given that it can be naturally associated with two frameworks that are becoming more and more popular in this field. To understand the possible beneficial e ff ects of QC in this field, here we derive, using QC properties in a genetic al-gorithm, the Hubble constant H0, and today’s matter density content ΩM by modeling data from Supernovae Type Ia (SNe Ia), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), and the Cosmic Mi-crowave Background (CMB) Radiation. It is worth stressing that the determination of ( ΩM , H0) is a standard task with well-known and accurately working classical methods already avail-able. This allows us to directly test the results obtained with our Amplitude-Encoded Quantum Genetic Algorithm (AEQGA) on a simple problem with known solutions. The aim is to find the same solution with this new QC approach, thus showing its potential before moving to more complicated challenges involv-ing a larger number of cosmological parameters and datasets. In § 2, we present the cosmological data used in our analysis and how we implemented the cosmological objective function that we are considering for our genetic algorithm. In § 3, we present AEQGA, explaining each section of the code. In § 4we show the main results. In § 5 we show comparisons be-tween AEQGA and others, both classical and quantum (Acam-pora and Vitiello, 2021). Finally, in § 6 we draw some conclu-sions. In § Appendix A an introduction to quantum computing in general is found. In § Appendix B, we introduce genetic algorithms, both classical and quantum, already analyzed in the literature, while in § Appendix C we show the reliability tests performed to confirm the goodness of the results of AEQGA. 22. Data and model 

As previously mentioned, we consider three cosmological probes for our analysis: SNe Ia, BAO, and CMB. Having three probes, one could ideally combine all of them to define a sin-gle objective function as the sum of the χ2 values of each probe. However, caution is needed because of the so-called 

H0 tension (Abdalla et al., 2022), i.e., the fact that estimates of the Hubble constant from local distance estimators (such as Cepheids) strongly disagree with those inferred from early universe probes. Since SNe Ia have been calibrated on the Classical Cepheids following the cosmological ladder approach (Brout et al., 2022; Scolnic et al., 2022), they can be consid-ered late-time cosmological probes. On the other hand, both the CMB spectrum and the BAO measurements are early-time cosmological probes, so we can safely combine them. Since it is not our aim here to address the H0 tension issue, in the follow-ing, we will run our algorithm using SNe Ia and CMB + BAO separately. This will also allow us to check its performance on di ff erent datasets. 

2.1. SNe Ia 

SNe Ia are a particular type of Supernova explosion occur-ring in binary systems after the accretion of mass of a white dwarf from its companion star. These objects are of fundamen-tal importance for cosmology (Riess et al., 1998; Abdalla et al., 2022), because of their role as standardizable candles (Phillips, 1993), i.e. the possibility of recovering their luminosity dis-tance with intrinsic physical characteristics similar for all the SNe Ia. The luminosity distance is defined as (Hogg, 1999) 

dL(z) = (1 + z)dM(z) , (1) where dM(z) is the transverse comoving distance 

dM(z) = cH0

Z z

> 0

dz ′

E(z′) , (2) where E(z) is defined as 

E(z) = H(z)

H0

= pΩr(1 + z)4 + Ω M (1 + z)3 + Ω k(1 + z)2 + Ω Λ .

(3) Here: 

• Ωr is the radiation density. 

• Ωk is the spatial curvature density. 

• ΩΛ is the Dark Energy component. These parameters refer to the current epoch of the Universe. Under the assumption of flat Λ Cold Dark Matter (CDM) model, Ωk = 0 and today Ωr is negligible. The measured quan-tity is the distance modulus, defined as 

μth ,S NeIa = m − M = 5 log( dL) + 25 , (4) where m is the apparent magnitude of the SN Ia, M its absolute magnitude, and the luminosity distance is expressed in Mpc. The degeneracy between M and H0 is the main reason why SNe IA need to be calibrated on other primary distance indicators, like the previously mentioned Classical Cepheids, as is done in the SH0ES program (Riess et al., 2022). This quantity is com-pared with the observed distance modulus, μobs of the SN Ia by defining a χ2 function. We use the SNe Ia Pantheon + sample (Scolnic et al., 2022; Brout et al., 2022), which is a compilation of 1701 light curves gathered from 1550 di ff erent sources, and one of the most refined SNe Ia datasets employed for cosmo-logical computations. Here, the χ2 function is defined as 

χ2 

> S NeIa

= (μth − μobs )T C−1

> S NeIa

(μth − μobs ) , (5) where C−1 

> S NeIa

is the inverse of the covariance matrix for the Pantheon + data (Scolnic et al., 2022), for which we have considered both statistical and systematic contributions, as done in (Sarracino et al., 2022). All these functions are dependent on the cosmological parameters, among which are those we analyze, H0 and ΩM .To decrease the computational cost, we have precomputed the integral in Eq. (1) for 100 and 300 evenly spaced ΩM values over the range of interest (0 .0, 0.5). For each ΩM selected by the algorithm, we look for the closest value in the grid and se-lect the corresponding integral value. We have verified that the mean and standard deviation provided by our quantum genetic algorithm, as described in § 4, do not change if we increase the number of points in the grid. This means that the tiny loss of precision in the approximation of the luminosity distance in-tegral is a reasonable cost for speeding up the computation of the objective function. This is also the reason why we have not performed linear interpolations on these values. We refer to 

§ Appendix C.1 for the di ff erence between the pre-computed and analytical χ2 functions. 

2.2. BAO Baryon Acoustic Oscillations are fluctuations in the density of the visible baryonic matter of the universe, caused by acous-tic density waves in the primordial plasma (Eisenstein et al., 2005). We have used a set of 16 BAO-related data points, as done in Dainotti et al. (2022); Spallicci et al. (2022); Sarra-cino et al. (2022), that have been derived from di ff erent obser-vations of galaxy correlations, Lyman α forests, and quasars. This dataset has been gathered from the results shown in Beutler et al. (2011); Blake et al. (2012); Ross et al. (2015); du Mas des Bourboux et al. (2020); Alam et al. (2021). We note that, while for the SNe Ia each measurement is associated with the lumi-nosity distance, for the BAO each measurement may be associ-ated with a di ff erent cosmological quantity, even if they can all be associated to the angular-diameter distance, typically used for the so-called distance reguli, as the BAO are. These cosmo-logical quantities are defined as 

dV (z) B

, (6) 

A(z) B 100 dV (z) pΩM h2

cz , (7) 3dH (z) B cH(z) , (8) and the comoving distance defined in Eq. (2). Here, h =

H0/100 km /s/Mpc. dV (z) is known as the volume averaged distance (Carter et al., 2018), A(z) as the acoustic parameter (Blake et al., 2012), and dH (z) is a distance directly defined via 

H(z). Some of these measurements are rescaled with the sound horizon rd. Thus, in our computations, we have implemented the following numerical approximation (Aubourg et al., 2015; Sharov, 2016): 

rd = 55 .154 · e[−72 .3( Ων h2+0.0006) 2]

(ΩM h2)0.25351 (Ωbh2)0.12807 M pc , (9) where Ωb is the baryonic density of the universe and Ων is the neutrino density. Since we are interested in deriving only ΩM

and H0 in our tests, we set Ωb · h2 = 0.02237 (Aghanim et al., 2020) and Ων·h2 = 0.00064, corresponding to a total of neutrino masses Σmν ≈ 0.06 (Lesgourgues and Pastor, 2006; Aghanim et al., 2020). We define a χ2 merit function as: 

χ2 

> BAO

= (Dth ,BAO − Dobs ,BAO )T C−1

> BAO

(Dth ,BAO − Dobs ,BAO ) , (10) where DBAO is the BAO dataset including the measured values of the quantities shown in Eqs. (6, 7, 8) eventually rescaled with Eq. (9). We retrieve the covariance matrix from Beutler et al. (2011); Blake et al. (2012); Ross et al. (2015); du Mas des Bourboux et al. (2020); Alam et al. (2021), by combining all the di ff erent measurements and hence including o ff -diagonal terms in the covariance matrix as they have been reported in the datasets. When the measurements are uncorrelated, we com-pute χ2 

> BAO

for each one, and add all the contributions. In to-tal, our BAO dataset is composed of 16 measurements. Out of these, 10 present o ff -diagonal terms in the covariance matrix, all of which are not negligible. 

2.3. CMB 

Being here interested in presenting a novel methodology rather than the constraints themselves, we used only a subset of the latest CMB measurements by the Planck mission (Aghanim et al., 2020). In particular, we downloaded the Temperature-Temperature (TT) Power Spectrum and compared it with the theoretical spectrum computed from the Code for Anisotropies in the Microwave Background ( CAMB ) python interface (Lewis et al., 2000) fixing all the cosmological parameters but H0 and 

ΩM to their best-fit values reported in Aghanim et al. (2020). The agreement is quantified by a usual χ2 function between the measured spectrum and the corresponding squared di ff er-ence obtained with the theoretical fit evaluated independently for each multipole moment. To reduce the computational time, we tested two strategies. In the first approach, we pre-computed the spectra for three di ff erent grids of ΩM and H0 values before the evaluation of the objective function. In the second, instead, we used an emulator, Parameters for the Impatient Cosmologist (PICO ) (Fendt and Wandelt, 2007b,a), which is able to interpo-late the TT spectra in a faster way with respect to CAMB . Among these two strategies, we chose to use PICO for our computa-tions. For details, see § Appendix C.1. 

3. Amplitude-Encoded Quantum Genetic Algorithm 

In this section, we describe the implementation of AEQGA. The peculiarities of the problem we want to address have mo-tivated us to develop a hybrid quantum genetic algorithm per-forming quantum operations only over a part of it. In particular, the merit evaluation of the χ2 functions associated with each set of cosmological parameters is computed classically. On the contrary, encoding the population, genetic operations, and de-coding are quantum operations. Needing to compute the merit function to find the set of parameters that optimize it somewhat hinders the advantage of a quantum algorithm, as it is also the most computationally expensive step. Nevertheless, the quan-tum implementation of the crossover and mutation operations allows for a comparison with their classical counterparts, hence highlighting the usefulness of the QC approach. As mentioned in § 1, our goal is finding the best-fit parame-ters for cosmological functions in di ff erent parameter spaces, in particular for ΩM and H0. AEQGA has been designed follow-ing the general scheme of genetic algorithms, thus considering as hyperparameters, among the others detailed in § 3.4, the pop-ulation size (whose individuals are pairs of ΩM and H0 values), and the number of generations for each iteration of the genetic algorithm. As a starting point, we initialize the population by ran-domly picking values over the ranges [0 .0, 0.5] for ΩM and [60 , 80] km /s/Mpc for H0 (all the results shown for H0 inside our analysis are in km /s/Mpc). We then perform the classi-cal evaluation of the objective function for each individual of the population, and the selection of the best-fitting individuals, i.e., those corresponding to the smallest values of the function. Then, the quantum part of the algorithm proceeds as sketched below: 

• encoding of the population inside the quantum circuit; 

• quantum crossover and quantum mutation operations; 

• quantum decoding. For the evaluation of the objective function, we proceed clas-sically by computing the χ2 as described in § 2. For the selection of the individuals inside the population, we consider the 25% of our population that obtains the best values for the objective function, and we store them for the next step, to be sure that for each generation the new population will be at least as good as the previous one when finding the best-fit individuals. We then repopulate the rest of the population by duplicating the best individuals, to obtain another 25% of the total new population, and randomly pick the rest 50% inside the intervals defined for the starting population. This means that 75% of the population e ff ectively enters the quantum circuits. In summary, at each generation: 

• We select the 25% best individuals, that do not enter the quantum circuits; 4• duplicate them to produce another 25%, resulting in 50% of the new population, that enters into a specific quantum circuit; 

• generate the remaining 50% randomly, on which quantum operations are also performed in another circuit. These two subsets of the population (the duplicates and the randomly picked) are then encoded in two di ff erent quantum circuits. This is because of the di ff erent ranges considered for the decoding (see § 3.3), and for matching the number of qubits properly with the classical elements. Each element of our quan-tum circuit is described in the following subsections, taking as a reference point 3 qubits. A schematic pseudo-code for this algorithm is shown in Alg. 1.

3.1. Amplitude Quantum Encoding 

The process of encoding real data in quantum circuits can be performed in di ff erent ways. In § Appendix B, for instance, we describe the binary encoding, which translates a value in its binary notation, and then associates it with the corresponding quantum state using the appropriate number of qubits, which is given by the number of digits in binary notation used to express the number itself. This poses limitations on the classical sets that need to be discretized and limited in depth to perform this encoding. Furthermore, the number of qubits depends on the characteristics of the values rather than on the population size (for instance, on the number of significant digits for a specific number). The strategy we followed, instead, is that of amplitude en-coding (Gonzalez-Conde et al., 2024), according to which one normalizes the classical array containing the population and then assigns to each number the amplitude of the quantum states rather than the quantum states themselves. Quantita-tively, this is described as follows: Given a classical array of real values x = [x0, x1, . . . , xN−1], this is first normalized so that 

PN−1 

> i=0

|xi|2 = 1. This can be mapped into a quantum state de-fined as 

|ψ⟩ =

> N−1

X

> i=0

xi|i⟩, (11) where {| i⟩} denotes the computational basis of an n-qubit sys-tem with N = 2n states, while xi are e ff ectively the amplitudes associated to this basis. The main advantage of this procedure is that the number of qubits necessary to encode a given popula-tion scales logarithmically with the size of the population itself, and does not depend on the classical values inside the popula-tion because it acts on rescaled arrays. The main drawback is that, being the population encoded not by the quantum states but by their amplitude, this does not allow for search routines used in other quantum algorithms, like the ones presented in 

§ Appendix B.2. Also, the decoding phase has to be designed accordingly, by considering that the relevant information is not the quantum state itself, but the associated probability. This encoding, as well as the rest of the circuit, has been implemented using Qiskit 1 (Javadi-Abhari et al., 2024). This package allows us to emulate quantum computers’ behaviour in classical ones; indeed, all the results shown in our analysis have been obtained by this emulator. The amplitude encoding can be easily implemented via the initialize function, once the population set, i.e., the vectors with the individual values for 

ΩM and H0, respectively, is normalized accordingly. We now describe how we have divided the population in the encoding phase. The elements representing ΩM and H0 are inserted in separate but similar and independent quantum cir-cuits, given that the encoding and decoding phases depend on the interval range in which these values are picked. Taking as a reference point a population of 16 individuals, the 4 provid-ing the best values for the objective function do not enter inside any quantum circuit, the 4 duplicates are encoded in a 2-qubit quantum circuit, the remaining 8 in a di ff erent 3-qubit quan-tum circuit. More generally, for a population of np individuals, log 2(np)−2 qubits are necessary for the quantum circuit regard-ing the duplicates of the best subset, and log 2(np) − 1 qubits for the circuit associated with the rest of the population. The en-coding phase is the same for both circuits. This is also the main reason why we have used the aforementioned percentages to di-vide our individuals, so that they match exactly the circuit we build according to this encoding strategy. In Fig. 1 we present the decomposition of the initialize func-tion of Qiskit for the encoding of a population composed of 8 individuals, corresponding to the first block shown in Fig. 2, where the entire circuit is shown. In this plot, the U gates rep-resent both the most general rotation of three Euler Angles, as in Eq. (A.8) shown in the § Appendix A, while the operations linking two qubits are the CNOT gates, defined in Eq. (A.9). The R gates are instead rotations around specific axes that will

be detailed in the next subsection. We note that a certain degree of entanglement is achieved by the combined use of rotation and CNOT gates, because they link all the qubits inside the circuit. 

3.2. Quantum Crossover and Mutation 

Because of the encoding strategy of the classic populations, what can significantly modify the population after the final measurements of the quantum circuit are operations that mod-ify the probability associated with a quantum state rather than the quantum state itself. This is because, as we have encoded our results in the amplitudes, what we want to focus on is not how many times a particular state is measured, as it would have been the case if we were to use the binary encoding, but the overall distributions of the measurements, which are more strictly linked to their overall distributions of amplitudes. Thus, we have chosen to represent both the genetic operations via rotations around the y and x axes, being the rotation around the z-axis a phase shift irrelevant to the final probability. The quantum crossover is defined as a coupled conditioned rotation around the y-axis performed on two randomly picked qubits. The rotation has been chosen to be π/ 2 to maximize the vari-ation on the probability associated with the involved quantum states due to the crossover. Mathematically, following the for-malism of quantum gates, this operation is described as follows, taking the first qubit as the control and the second as the target: CR y

. (13) Then, the quantum crossover is completed by performing the same operation but switching the roles of the qubits. The total matrix Ucross obtained by combining these two operation is thus

(14) For the quantum mutation, instead, we have chosen to schematize it as a rotation of π/ 2 around the x-axis, performed randomly on one of the qubits in the quantum circuit. This op-eration is expressed by the matrix Umut defined as

3.3. Quantum Decoding 

The last step is the classical measurements. Here, the num-ber of simulations of the quantum circuit has to be provided, as we are emulating it on a classical machine via Qiskit. Then, di ff erent information can be extracted, such as the probabili-ties associated with di ff erent quantum states and the final state vector of the system. We stress again that for AEQGA what is 6important are the associated probabilities to the quantum states rather than the singular measurements on the states themselves, to underline the di ff erence with the binary encoding. Hence, we have to entirely focus on these for our decoding strategy. We have followed two di ff erent paths for the two quantum circuits necessary for the entire set of individuals. For the 8 individuals randomly drawn, the decoding normal-izes the number of outcomes for each quantum state, mapped in the interval range of the population, so that the highest value is mapped in the upper limit of the population range (0 .5 for ΩM

and 80 for H0) and the lowest number in the lower limit (0 for 

ΩM and 60 for H0)2. Quantitatively, this operation in general can be summarized as follows 

xi = a + (b − a) · ci − cmin 

cmax − cmin 

, (16) where [ a, b] is the mapped interval, ci is the measurement count for the i-th quantum state, cmin = min i ci, and cmax = max i ci.For the 4 individuals originated by the duplication of the best pairs from the previous generation, instead, a di ff erent decod-ing process has been considered. Instead of spanning the entire population range, a box has been chosen around the region de-limited by the best individuals from the previous population, with the idea of allowing this subset to “ remember” the re-sults from the previous generation, without completely disrupt-ing them. Here, the values of the individuals are not mapped directly in the entire interval range, but derived from the per-centages of the measurements associated with each quantum state. Mathematically, this operation is described as follows: we select a restricted interval [ nmin , nmax ] around the region de-fined by the best individuals of the previous generation, and the new individuals from the decoding are derived from 

xi = nmin + (nmax − nmin ) · √pi, (17) where 

pi = ci

P j c j

, (18) are the percentages of the given measurements. The √pi has been used phenomenologically to find values that are more probable in the central region of the box in which we have lim-ited the best individuals. The quantum decoding is summarized in Alg. 2. 

3.4. Overview of Hyperparameters and Experiments 

After the quantum decoding, a new generation starts with a novel merit evaluation, repeating the cycle. After the last gener-ation, the best-fit values for ΩM and H0 are saved (i.e., the pair corresponding to the lowest value for the objective function in the algorithm). Then, AEQGA is run for di ff erent iterations, to    

> 2We note that, if more than one state presents 0 measurements, these would all correspond to the lower limit of the populations (0 for ΩMand 60 for H0), thus not allowing to explore the entire interval range with all the individuals. To avoid this possibility, we have substituted the cases in which the exact lower limit is obtained by the algorithm with a random value in the proper interval range.

Output : Decoded vector x of the classical individuals for the populations find a mean for the obtained values of ΩM and H0 and to com-pute the related uncertainties from the distribution of results. Thus, as a summary, AEQGA contains the following hyperpa-rameters, which can be regulated: 

• The number of individuals inside the population, np, di-rectly linked to the number of qubits used for the quantum circuit. For the experiments concerning how the results are influenced by the number of generations and the crossover and mutation probabilities, it has been set to 16. This cor-responds to two circuits of 2 and 3 qubits, for the dupli-cated and randomly picked parts, respectively. We also recall that the ΩM and H0 populations go into di ff erent in-dependent circuits. Instead, for the plots concerning one run of the algorithm given a certain number of iterations, this number has been set to 32, because of an interesting eff ect on the results given by np which will be detailed in 

§ 4.2. 

• The number of generations for a single iteration of the ge-netic algorithm, ng. For all the experiments but the ones related to the influence of this hyperparameter on the re-sults, it has been set to 50. 

• The number of iterations needed for a statistical analysis on the precision of the results, ni, set to 300. 

• Crossover and mutation probabilities inside the quantum circuit. The e ff ects on the precision of the results are ex-tensively studied in § 4.1. Having only two cosmological parameters, we can compute the objective function over the full 2D plane, draw contours, and directly look for the best fit. Note that this brute force ap-proach can hardly be performed for a much larger number of parameters. This is why we focused on a problem with a small 70.25 0.30 0.35 0.40 0.45

The global minimum sits in ( ΩM , H0) = (0 .363 , 72 .82) for SNe Ia, and in (ΩM , H0) = (0 .323 , 66 .76) for CMB + BAO with no evidence of further local minima. In these plots are also reported two re-sults found from the literature. On the left panel, the one taken from Hu et al. (2024) for the Pantheon +, chosen because in their analysis they vary only ( ΩM , H0) as in our case. On the right panel, instead, the one related only to the CMB TT spectrum taken from Aghanim et al. (2020), with the caveat that their analysis considers directly other cosmological parameters and does not consider BAO for that specific result. Nevertheless, in both cases, they are consistent with our objective functions. 

4. Results and Comparisons 

For our computations, we have used a machine made up of 1 CPU, model intel(R) Core(TM) i9-10980XE CPU @ 3.00GHz. The CPU has 18 cores and 2 threads per core. The RAM of the hardware is 128 GBs. For our purposes and analyses, we used up to 8 cores, usually divided for di ff erent runs. A single run of AEQGA with 4 cores, np = 16, ng = 50, and ni = 300 takes around 3900 seconds and less than 1 GB of RAM during its run. This computational time scales linearly with np, ng, and 

ni. As previously mentioned, the most time-consuming part of AEQGA is the evaluation of the merit function, followed by the simulations of the quantum circuit in the measurement phase. In Fig. 4 we show two examples of results for our algorithm. On the left panel for SNe Ia, on the right one for CMB + BAO. In both cases, we set the quantum crossover and mutation prob-abilities to 0.5, which corresponds to one of the points with the highest precision on the results (as we will show in § 4.1). Here, 

np = 32 and ng = 50 (Tests on the influence on the results from the values of np and ng are detailed in § 4.2, here we show only an example run of AEQGA). We note how the results are con-sistent with the maps of the objective function shown in Fig. 3 for both cases. Indeed, the mean and the standard deviations of the 300 iterations for AEQGA are (0 .362 ± 0.016) for ΩM and (72 .81 ±0.22) for H0 for SNe Ia, and (0 .324 ±0.008) for ΩM and (66 .68 ± 0.56) for H0 for CMB + BAO. In both cases, we obtain results that are consistent with the true minima of the objective functions, shown in § 3.4, within 1 σ.We emphasize that the errors obtained by AEQGA on the re-sults are purely statistical, computed by computing the mean and variance on the di ff erent positions found by the 300 itera-tions of the algorithm for each run, thus having a fundamentally di ff erent meaning from, for instance uncertainty contours that one could obtain by using Bayesian methods, which is a funda-mental method widely used in cosmology. Indeed, our aim is to minimize the χ2 function, and not find posterior probabilities around the minimum. Having proven that the minima found by AEQGA are con-sistent with those of the real cosmological objective functions, we now show the analysis regarding the influence of the hyper-parameters of AEQGA. 

4.1. Experiments on crossover and mutation 

We study the dependency with the probabilities associated with quantum crossover and mutation, obtaining results from AEQGA for di ff erent pairs of them, moving from probabili-ties 0 (0%) to 1 (100%) of these computations to happen in-side the quantum circuit with a step of 0.1. For these tests, 

np = 16 and ng = 50. The results for H0 are shown in Fig. 5. We note how for the SNe Ia the worst results in terms of precision are at the extreme values for the hyperparameters, es-pecially for crossover probability = 1. This is consistent with what one would expect from a typical classical genetic algo-rithm, in which crossover and mutation probabilities are cho-sen to make these operations significant but do not completely 80.32 0.34 0.36 0.38 0.40

disrupt the initial population. This observation indicates that our definitions of quantum crossover and mutation have posi-tively impacted the exploration of the parameter space of the population, thereby enhancing the precision of the results for appropriate values of the related probabilities. The regular be-havior of our results with the hyperparameters has enabled us to draw contour levels depending on the standard deviation of the results for the SNe Ia, as shown in the left panel of Fig. 5. The minimum value for the precision on H0 and ΩM has been ob-tained for (0.2, 0.9), but we also note that many uncertainties on the results are close one to the other, as shown in the following. We now discuss the results concerning the CMB + BAO set. In this case, there is no defined trend correlated with the prob-abilities, di ff erently from the SNe Ia case. The main point in common between the two maps is that the results are generally worse for crossover probability 1.0, but there is no clear region where we can find results with better precision, as shown in the right panel of Fig. 5 for H0 (the same discussion applies to ΩM ). This means that the results are more stable when we vary crossover and mutation probabilities than the SNe Ia com-putations. Regarding the lowest standard deviation, it has been obtained for (0.9, 0.7), followed by (0.0, 0.0) (thus without both crossover and mutation). To further study the dependency of the precision of the results on the crossover and mutation probabilities, we choose some pairs of these hyperparameters and run the algorithm 10 times, to evaluate the mean and standard deviation of the errors with the goal of understanding if the di ff erences between the points in the maps shown in Fig. 5 are relevant or not. The results of this analysis, obtained by fixing the value of the mutation probability to 0.5, are shown in Fig. 6, on the top panel for the SNe Ia, on the bottom for CMB + BAO. In both cases, the data shown refer to H0, but the behavior for ΩM is very similar. SNe Ia results are characterized by a general trend in the un-certainty. A minimum is reached for intermediate values of the crossover probability, while the error increases both for very low and high values of this hyperparameter. We also note that, considering the standard deviation, the values inside the lowest contour level in the top panels of Fig. 5 are statistically equiv-alent. This check confirms the discussion presented in the pre-vious paragraph regarding the results of the SNe Ia. This anal-ysis has also been performed on other interesting points in the parameter space; more specifically, (0.2, 0.9), where the mini-mum on the uncertainties of the results has been found from the map, (0, 0), (1,0), (0,1), (1,1), confirming the results obtained by the map itself, while also proving that the points (0.2, 0.9) and (0.5, 0.5) are statistically equivalent for the precision on the results. Thus, for the other tests, we keep the crossover and mu-tation probabilities for the SNe Ia at (0.5, 0.5), symbolizing an equal possibility of quantum crossover and mutation operations inside AEQGA. Regarding CMB +BAO, instead, we do not see a strong vari-ability of the results as a function of the crossover probability if we fix the mutation at 0.5, as we did in the top panel of Fig. 6. This e ff ect could be due to the dispersion of the results, which is generally higher than the SNe Ia case after the rescaling for the mean value of the uncertainties. It can also be the reason why there is stability on the two hyperparameters that emerge from the bottom panels of Fig. 5. The results directly analyzed, which are di ff erent and present the highest precision, are the 90.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0

ones corresponding to (0,0) and (0.9, 0.7), chosen by us be-cause they correspond to the highest precision results found in our map. In summary, taking as a reference point the (0, 0) probabilities for crossover and mutation, we can conclude that in the SNe Ia case we find regions in which such probabilities find more precise results for probabilities di ff erent from 0. This instead cannot be concluded for the CMB +BAO tests, for the reasons previously detailed. 

4.2. Experiments on number of generations and individuals 

Let us now study how our results change with np and ng.We focus on the SNe Ia results, fixing crossover and mutation probabilities at (0.5, 0.5). For the tests on ng we fix np = 16, and the results are shown in Tab. 1. The computations for ΩM

and H0 have been performed as the mean of the various tests used for our comparison. All of them are consistent within 1 σ.We also note the monotonic trend both for ΩM and H0 with ng,approaching the absolute minimum of our merit function, and a general decreasing trend of the errors on both ΩM and H0

with ng. This is expected given how our algorithm works. This gain becomes less significant in the runs with very high ng (for instance, the di ff erence in the uncertainty on ΩM between the runs with ng = 1000 and ng = 50 is 0 .072, while it is only 0 .009 between the runs with ng = 3000 and ng = 2000). This aspect also emerges in the plot shown in Fig. 7, where the errors on 

ΩM are plotted against ng.In the right panel, we show the ΩM obtained with our algo-rithm with ng. While all the results are consistent within 1 σ to the analytical minimum and between each other, we note a clear trend in the mean value, which tends to the analytical minimum of the objective function. In doing a simple logarithmic fit, we find that it reaches the true minimum for ng ≈ 10193. It is im-portant to stress that this particular behaviour has been noted only for np = 16, as we will show in the following. 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0

Table 2: Results on ΩM and H0 with the means and standard deviations for the errors on both these quantities obtained considering the SNe Ia and varying np.Here, ng = 50. 

For the analysis on np, we fix ng = 50, and the crossover and mutation probabilities to (0.5, 0.5). The results are shown in Tab. 2. Di ff erently from the previous case, increasing np does not increase the precision of the results in a significant way, di ff erently from the tests with ng. This could be due to how we have defined the subset of best individuals of a given popula-tion, recalling that it is the 25% of the entire sample. Increasing the sample size increases the number of chosen best individu-als, which in turn increases the interval range from which the new individuals are computed from the corresponding quantum circuit, thus increasing the variability of the set itself. Neverthe-less, the dispersion of the errors for both ΩM and H0 is smaller than in the case where we increase the number of generations. Again, all the results on the measurement are consistent within 1σ.There is an interesting behaviour we obtain by increasing np,noticeable in Fig. 8, where we compare the results obtained by AEQGA with di ff erent values for np with the analytical merit function of the SNe IA, in particular considering the 1, 2, and 3 σ contours. With np = 16, we obtain a stronger correla-tion between the individual outcomes of the genetic algorithm. This trend does not appear with a bigger np, which instead fol-lows more closely the merit function. We stress that this is a secondary e ff ect for our results, as we are not interested in re-producing the shape of the merit function. Nevertheless, this is an interesting e ff ect to highlight, probably linked to the smaller number of qubits used for the populations with np = 16, and this is also the reason why we show the results of a single run with 

np = 32. This stronger correlation in the results also explains why in Tab. 2 the results for np = 16 show the smallest errors on ΩM and H0, as well as why the mean values of these quan-tities appear di ff erent (albeit still consistent within 1 σ) with respect to the other runs. Indeed, apart from this value, also the trend varying np becomes closer to what we have found for 

ng, with the most precise result being achieved with the higher value of np, even if the previous discussions on the sample size still apply. Another test regards the analysis of the position of the mini-mum found by AEQGA, given by the mean of the results of all the iterations of one run. In particular, we present how, for the SNe Ia, this changes with ng (top left panel of Fig. 9) and np

(top right panel of the same figure). In the first analysis, where 

np = 16, we note how by increasing ng the results get closer to the absolute minimum. We also note that, as we have shown in Tab. 1, the related uncertainties decrease with ng, so that all our results are consistent at the same level with the absolute mini-mum. In the top right panel, instead, where we vary np fixing 

ng = 50, we see that by increasing np from 16 to 32, we get very close results to the analytical minimum. This is still because of the stronger correlation found for np = 16, which is not found for higher np. This is further confirmed by the bottom panels of Fig. 9, where we show the same analysis fixing np = 32 and np = 64, respectively, and varying ng. Here, the quantum results are close to the absolute minimum for every ng = 32. 

5. Comparison with other Algorithms 

Let us now compare the results obtained by AEQGA with the ones obtained via other methods. We implemented two classi-cal algorithms.

Bottom right panel: with np = 128. while 25% are randomly generated within a box around the re-gion where the best individuals were found, and the remaining 50% are randomly generated inside the entire interval range in which the initial population is defined. The second algorithm, instead, is a simple classical genetic algorithm with operations of crossover and mutations, the former defined as the mixing of the elements of di ff erent individuals, while the latter as the mu-tation of a given element of a random quantity. This algorithm also presents a duplication step, but it does not preserve a priori the best individuals of the population at each generation. The idea is to test how AEQGA compares with two simple classical paradigms, where in the former we keep the same preservation of the best individual at each generation, while in the latter we define crossover and mutation operations which resemble what was done in AEQGA, with the caveat that more refined classi-cal operations are possible. The results are shown in Tab. 3. Here ng = 50, while the crossover and mutation probabilities for the classical genetic al-gorithm are fixed at (0.5, 0.5), as previously done for the quan-tum genetic algorithm. Comparing these results with the ones from AEQGA, shown in the first row of Tabs. 1 and 2, we note

how the recursive algorithm is more precise for both ΩM and 

H0, than the other two (for instance, the uncertainties on ΩM

and H0 derived from the recursive algorithm are 40% and 52% of the ones given by the classical one for np = 16). Again, the results are consistent within 1 σ.This result is due to how the recursive algorithm explores the parameter space, being completely random, especially in the box defined around the best results. But, on the other hand, it is also more sensitive to the size of the box itself, while, for the decoding strategy we employed, where we recall we have 12 0.354 0.356 0.358 0.360 0.362

a non-linear multiplication of the probabilities to better explore the central regions of the box, AEQGA is less sensitive to this parameter. The classical genetic algorithm is not as precise be-cause of its very simple formulation and because it does not preserve the best individuals a priori at each generation. We have still kept this result because it is interesting to see if AE-QGA compares favorably to a classical one, even if the latter can be improved in its formulation. These considerations are especially true for np = 16, where we also recall the stronger correlation between the two parameters for the quantum results explained in the previous section. For np = 32, instead, the precision on the results between the classic and quantum algo-rithms becomes more similar, while the recursive is still more precise (quantitatively, the uncertainties on ΩM and H0 derived from the recursive algorithm are both 51% of the ones given by the classical one). We note that for np = 32 the mean values for 

ΩM and H0 for AEQGA become closer to the classical com-putations. As an example, the percentage di ff erence between the classical and AEQGA results for ΩM goes from 2 .3% for 

np = 16 to 0 .3% for np = 32. The results for a single computation with np = 32 are dis-played in Fig. 10. In this case, the overall dispersion of the quantum results is very similar to the classical one. This be-comes clearer in comparison with the analytical objective func-tion shown in the right panels of this figure, where we also show the covariance ellipse computed for our results. Again, all our results are consistent within 1 σ with the absolute ana-lytical minimum. Regarding the scalability and computational costs, both classical algorithms scale linearly with np, ng, and 

ni, as AEQGA, because of the similarities between the three algorithms. AEQGA is not faster than the two classical al-gorithms because of the emulation costs, the number of shots necessary to obtain results from the quantum circuit, and, more importantly, because the evaluation of the objective function re-mains classical. Nevertheless, both the accuracy and the com-putational costs of these three algorithms remain in the same order of magnitude, and scale in the same way with the hyper-parameters. As a second test, we considered another quantum genetic algorithm already implemented in the literature and compared the results. In particular, we used, for the SNe Ia, the HQGA (Acampora and Vitiello, 2021) on which we give more insights 13 0.28 0.30 0.32 0.34 0.36 0.38 0.40 0.42 0.44

in § Appendix B.2. We here just note that the philosophy of the two algorithms is intrinsically di ff erent, HQGA being based on binary encoding, discretization of the objective func-tion, elitism for the evaluation of the fitness (i.e. evaluating the fitness function not for all the individuals of the population but selecting the best ones before the computation), and a di ff erent definition of the quantum crossover operation, that in HQGA is always performed. All these di ff erences translate into di ff erent dependencies on the hyperparameters and computational costs. Even so, the comparison is still interesting, to understand which approach can be more e ffi cient for the particular case under analysis, as well as to compare AEQGA with another one proven to be re-liable for various benchmarking functions (Acampora and Vi-tiello, 2021). Again, we focus on the SNe Ia computations, whose merit function has been introduced in the HQGA case studies. The results are shown in Fig. 11, where we compare the results de-rived by AEQGA ( ng = 50, np = 32, ni = 300, crossover and mutation probabilities = 0.5) with two tests performed us-ing HQGA. For the tests shown in this plot, the hyperparameters used for the HQGA are itemized as follows: 

• binary string =10 (which indicates how many data points are used to discretize the function inside our interval range); 

• number of individuals for which the merit function is com-puted at each step =3; 

• mutation probability =0.5 (the crossover is always set to 1 in HQGA); 

• angle for the rotation gates used as initialization of the al-gorithm δ = π/ 8; 

• Quantum Elitism (QE), because HQGA allows choosing between three di ff erent approaches to select the individ-uals inside the population to compute the merit function: QE, Deterministic Elitism (DE), and Quantum with Rein-forcement Elitism (RE); 

• finally, 300 iterations, to derive means and uncertainties as we did for AEQGA. The di ff erence in the two HQGA tests is in the number of gen-erations, which is 100 for the results displayed in red, and 266 for the ones in green (chosen so that the total number of fitness evaluations needed by HQGA matches those needed by AE-QGA with np = 16, i.e. our result with the smallest number of evaluations of the objective function). Finally, we have tested the stability of the HQGA algorithm by running it 10 times with QE, 100 generations, and mutation probability =0.5, finding for the errors ∆Ω M = 0.027 ± 0.001 and ∆H0 = 0.33 ± 0.02. The algorithms present consistent results, thus confirming the validity of AEQGA. In comparing the precisions of the re-sults shown in 11, AEQGA is 41% and 20% more precise with respect to HQGA with 100 generations for ΩM and H0, respec-tively, while it is 6% and 13% less precise for HQGA with 266 generations. The tests we performed with HQGA are reported in Tab. 5. Here, δ is the angle associated with the further step provided by RE. The results obtained with QE have smaller uncertainties on 

ΩM and H0, while the best mutation probability and δ are 0 .5and π/ 16, respectively. Again, the results for ΩM and H0 are consistent with all tests and with AEQGA within 1 σ (§ 4). The improvement in the precision of the results obtained using 500 generations closely resembles what we have obtained in Tab. 1 from AEQGA when comparing the number of times the merit function has been evaluated by the two algorithms (1500 here for HQGA vs 1600 in the second row of that table for AEQGA). Indeed, looking also at the results with a higher number of gen-erations, the overall accuracy improves with the number of gen-erations in a similar fashion to what we have seen for AEQGA and ng.Regarding the scalability and the computational costs, be-cause HQGA uses binary encoding, for multidimensional func-tions the total length of the binary string corresponding to the qubits also depends on the number of parameters defining the objective function, which makes it hard to scale with more com-plex cosmological functions with respect to AEQGA, given that more qubits would be required. The computational time also depends on this parameter, alongside the number of individuals for which the objective function is evaluated. In summary. while AEQGA may be better suited for the ap-plication of cosmological functions than HQGA, it is no faster than classical computations because of the previously men-tioned bottlenecks. Although a gain in speed was not our main aim for this first application, we note that a fair comparison should be made by counting the number of merit evaluations 15 Elitism Mut. prob. Num.

needed to find the best fit. Moreover, it is still to be investi-gated how this latter scales with the number of parameters. It is, however, worth wondering how the present bottleneck can be circumvented. Some possible solutions could be: 

• implementing the merit evaluation in the quantum circuit; 

• following HQGA, inserting some form of elitism in AE-QGA; 

• decreasing the number of generations and individuals to acquire a specific precision on the results. 

6. Conclusions 

The impressive increase in the quality and quantity of data has turned cosmology from the “ search for two numbers” (in the words of Allan Sandage in the mid-70s) into a challenging exploration of many-dimensional parameter space. It has then become imperative to look for algorithms capable of perform-ing the challenging task of finding the best-fit values, minimiz-ing the merit function in a huge number of dimensions, espe-cially because these are usually associated with huge collec-tions of datasets which could also be cross-checked, increasing even more the computational complexity. Motivated by this necessity, we presented the first application of the QC tech-niques to the realm of cosmological parameter determination. We started from the relatively simple case with two parameters only, namely ( ΩM , H0), and two objective functions based on di ff erent datasets, i.e., SNe IA and CMB + BAO. Our aim here was to investigate whether QC methods can retrieve similar or compatible results to classical ones. We have therefore built a hybrid genetic algorithm in which the merit evaluation is performed classically, while the crossover and mutation operations are built in a quantum cir-cuit once the classical populations are translated into quantum information via amplitude encoding. AEQGA finds results consistent with the objective function maps for both the SNe Ia and CMB + BAO sets. We have thus analyzed its behavior as a function of the main hyperparameters of our procedure, namely the crossover and mutation probabil-ities, the population size np, and the number of generations ng

for each iteration. The precision of the results increases with 

ng, but so does the computation time, which scales linearly with 

ng, so one has to choose whether more precise results or a faster computation are needed. Instead, the precision does not mono-tonically improve with np, but it gets closer to the analytical minimum, especially in the jump between 16 and 32 individ-uals (see Fig. 9). The number of iterations ni has been set to 300 as a compromise between computation time and statisti-cal significance, but this can also be modified. Finally, an in-depth analysis has been performed on the e ff ects of mutation and crossover probabilities, finding interesting di ff erences be-tween the two studied sets. We also compared our results with two di ff erent classical ge-netic algorithms and a di ff erent hybrid quantum genetic algo-rithm, HQGA, whose philosophy is significantly di ff erent from AEQGA. These comparisons show that AEQGA derives results whose precision is consistent with the ones obtained with other methods. It is important to stress that this is the first approach of a novel computational paradigm, QC, to a very relevant problem for the cosmological community (i.e. optimization of cosmo-logical parameters and functions). This approach could pave the way for the applications of QC to more complex cosmolog-ical optimization and inference problems, which will be stud-ied in future works. Here, we simply note that, as it is now, increasing the dimensions of the parameter space (for instance, to 6 dimensions, which is the minimal number of parameters to describe the ΛCDM model) would require a bigger number of quantum circuits (in this case, 12 circuits), and thus, the com-putational time due to the emulation also increases. Not only that, but it could also be necessary to use more individuals per population, thus more qubits for each circuit. All these con-16 siderations mean that to solve realistic cosmological optimiza-tion problems, a more elaborate strategy could be necessary, especially for even more complex parameter spaces necessary for cosmological computations involving probes such as weak lensing. Indeed, for the latter, one not only has to derive the fundamental cosmological parameters that one wishes to study, but also two parameters for the intrinsic alignment along with a certain number of nuisance parameters (e.g., N shear multi-plicative bias parameters + N mean redshift shift parameters, where N is the number of redshift bins Laureijs et al. (2011)). This means that if one wishes to study this problem with AE-QGA, a very large number of quantum circuits would be neces-sary. Not only that, but even keeping ourselves with the probes used in this analysis, if one were to consider the proper CMB likelihood with all the nuisance parameters involved in these observations, the parameter space expands to more than 20 di-mensions (Aghanim et al., 2020). And this can also be true with other cosmological probes. Nevertheless, this could be worth the investigation in future works, especially in conjunction with Bayesian inference method, finding the region where the mini-mum of the objective function is and starting from that for the posterior inference, possibly saving a lot of computational time in the exploration of the parameter space. As an example of future work, also in conjunction with Bayesian inference applied to cosmological functions, in Sar-racino et al. (2025), a hybrid Quantum Markov Chain Monte Carlo (QMCMC) has been developed to find Bayesian con-tours of cosmological functions using quantum computing to define the exploration steps into the parameter space. While the scope of AEQGA is not finding the shape of the objective func-tions (even if in § Appendix C.2 we show how it can be recon-structed a posteriori by the algorithm results), but only finding the best-fit values, this algorithm could be used in conjunction with QMCMC (or any other classical Bayesian sampler) to help the inference of the Bayesian contours, by locating a priori the regions in the parameters space to explore finding the minima. Or, in the other sense, one could run a coarse-grained QMCMC to find approximately the regions in which AEQGA should be used. Another very interesting test to do in a future analysis would be to test this algorithm on a real Quantum Machine. These kinds of tests are important because, given that we are cur-rently in the Noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, noise propagation in the circuit is an important phenomenon that could potentially destroy the actual quantum coherence in the circuit, thus losing the quantum properties. Actual error propagation plays a fundamental role as well. Not only that, but in the current quantum circuit, not all the Qubits are directly linked to each other. Because of all these caveats, understand-ing if AEQGA can be properly executed by proper quantum circuits while maintaining its precision becomes an interesting test worth performing to understand its reliability. As a starting point of this analysis, we have run our AEQGA on simulated backends of real quantum hardware o ff ered by Qiskit, which are built to mimic the behaviors of IBM Quan-tum systems using system snapshots containing the fundamen-tal properties of these hardware 3. More specifically, we have considered a sample run with 5 generations and tried to run it using all the V2 fake backends present here. Out of these, on 25 we have managed to obtain an estimate on the QPU runtime, considering also the multiplication by the number of shots. In the vast majority of cases, on a run of approximately 8 seconds on the classical device, the estimated quantum runtime is less than 1 second, with the best result obtained by the FakeHanoi backend, with 0.22. This estimate does not take into account other time losses one would encounter in using quantum hard-ware, like the queue time or the submission time. Nevertheless, this also proves that, ideally, using real hardware would be ben-eficial for our computations with respect to the classical sim-ulations, albeit one has to note that the runtime would still be dominated by the evaluation of the objective function. In this sense, a possible way to find the quantum advantage that will be worth exploring could be in changing the aim of AEQGA, not fixing the hyperparameters a priori, but deriving the number of evaluations of the objective function a posteriori, giving as a convergence check for the algorithm a specific precision on the results. It is important to conclude here that this work is only a part of the research line looking for possible investigations that are currently being tested for the applications of Quantum Com-puting in Astrophysics and Cosmology. Apart from the QM-CMC, other ideas involve quantum machine learning for signal detection (Farsian et al., 2025a), Quantum Fourier Transform for CMB (Farsian et al., 2025b), and the numerical integration of di ff erential equations (Cappelli et al., 2025). Other possi-ble applications will also be investigated, like for instance data compression and analysis /classification of large datasets, a task of fundamental importance for astrophysical and cosmological datasets.

Appendix A. Brief Introduction to Quantum Computing 

The main di ff erence between QC and Classical Computing is in the fundamental information unit: indeed, while the lat-ter is the classical bit which can either be 0 or 1, the former is the qubit, which in the simplest case is a unit vector in a 2-dimensional space whose basis can be written as [ |0⟩ , |1⟩] (Ri-eff el and Polak, 2000; Chae et al., 2024). A single qubit can be in any superposition 

ψ = α |0⟩ + β |1⟩ , (A.1) with the constraint 

|α|2 + |β|2 = 1. (A.2) Geometrically, a qubit can be represented as a unitary vector lying in the so-called Bloch Sphere, which is a unit 2-sphere, whose north and south poles are usually chosen to represent the 

|0⟩ and |1⟩ states, respectively. A representation of the |0⟩ on the Bloch Sphere is shown in Fig. A.12. This novel formulation for the fundamental information unit allows to use concepts of Quantum Mechanics in the context of Computer Science, namely superposition and entanglement. The former is expressed as in Eq. (A.1) and generalizes straight-forwardly to an n-qubit register (i.e, a collection of qubits from which 2 n states can be defined via superposition). Entangle-ment, on the other hand, gives rise to multi-qubit states that can-not be expressed as tensor products of individual qubit states. An example is the Bell state for two qubits, expressed as fol-lows: 

ϕ = 1

√2 |00 ⟩ + 1

√2 |11 ⟩ , (A.3) where the notations |00 ⟩ and |11 ⟩ describe the tensor products 

|0⟩ ⊗ | 0⟩ and |1⟩ ⊗ | 1⟩ of the states of the single qubits, respec-tively. The existence of such states allows for quantum phe-nomena that would be impossible in a classical setting, such as instantly knowing the state of a qubit by measuring the one entangled to it independently of the distance between the two qubits. These correlations appear instantaneous but obey the no-signaling principle: they cannot be used for faster-than-light communication and are compatible with relativistic causality. Superposition and entanglement are pivotal concepts for QC, allowing to express 2 n possible states using only n di ff erent qubits. These state spaces can not be e ffi ciently explored using classical resources, thus requiring the proper usage of quantum resources and hardware. We focus on the gate-based QC framework, which has been used in our algorithm. Gates are unitary matrices that can act on a small number of qubits, and represent the quantum operations that can be performed on them. As an example, a very famous 1-qubit gate is the Hadamard, schematized as 

H = 1

√2

"1 11 −1

#

. (A.4) After the application of this gate to a qubit whose initial state is |0⟩ and measuring classically the new state, we find an equal probability of measuring |0⟩ and |1⟩. In general, any gate ap-plied on a single qubit may be schematized as a rotation around three di ff erent axes (from now on, we refer to the Bloch sphere and its axes when we describe rotations) 

Rx(θ) =

 cos  θ

 −i sin  θ



−i sin  θ

 cos  θ

Ry(θ) =

"cos( θ/ 2) − sin( θ/ 2) sin( θ/ 2) cos( θ/ 2) 

#

, (A.6) 

Rz(θ) =

"e−iθ/ 2 00 eiθ/ 2.

#

(A.7) The most general rotation around a given axis may be expressed as the following Unitary matrix: 

U = eiγ

"e−i(β+δ)/2 cos( θ/ 2) −e−i(β−δ)/2 sin( θ/ 2) 

ei(β−δ)/2 sin( θ/ 2) ei(β+δ)/2 cos( θ/ 2) 

#

, (A.8) where γ is a global phase, β and δ are the phases correspond-ing to rotations about the z-axis before and after the rotation θ

around the y-axis. We note how the rotation around the z-axis is a phase shift that does not change the probability associated with a quantum state. As we described in § 3.2, this is important for the implementation of our quantum genetic algorithm. Regarding the gates acting on more than one qubit, arguably, the most important quantum gate of this type is the controlled-NOT operation (CNOT), represented by the following matrix CNOT =



1 0 0 00 1 0 00 0 0 10 0 1 0



. (A.9) This operation uses two qubits, called control and target, and acts as follows: 21 • If the control qubit is in state |0⟩, the state of the target qubit remains unchanged. 

• If the control qubit is in state |1⟩, the state of the target qubit is flipped. The operations implemented in the quantum part of our algo-rithm are compositions of rotational gates acting on one qubit and CNOT gates linking two qubits, as shown in § 3. It is also possible to define directly gates acting as controlled rotations, i.e. compositions of unitary gates and CNOT. Generally, if one applies three rotation gates U1, U2, U3 then the composed gate 

C is defined as 

C = U3 U2 U1. (A.10) These gates are used in quantum circuits, that is, a series of operations acting on the qubits. These are concluded with the classical measurements, which collapse the quantum states into classical information. 

Appendix B. Genetic algorithms, cosmological applica-tions, and an overview on Quantum Genetic Algorithms 

In this section, we introduce genetic algorithms. First, we describe classical genetic algorithms and various cosmologi-cal applications. Then, we describe the quantum genetic algo-rithms already available in the literature, the idea behind their implementation, and their use cases. 

Appendix B.1. Classical genetic algorithms and cosmological applications 

Classical genetic algorithms (Goldberg, 1989) have now be-come a stable technique for a variety of problems, such as pa-rameter estimation and, in general, optimization of di ff erent kinds of merit functions. Given an initial population of candi-date solutions, genetic algorithms perform various operations, such as crossover and mutation among the individuals of the population, and then evaluate them via a merit function that assesses how good the individuals are as the solution of a par-ticular problem. The best individuals are selected in relation to the problem at hand and kept, while the rest of the population is re-populated according to a possible plethora of ways, tak-ing into consideration the operations performed at the previous generation. This process is repeated for di ff erent generations until a stopping criterion is reached. As previously mentioned, we aim to reproduce this idea with the means of QC, for the parameter estimation of cosmological functions. These kinds of algorithms are called genetic algorithms because they are inspired by natural evolutionary processes (Bagavathi and Saraniya, 2019). For a more detailed discus-sion on how they generally behave and what kind of operations can be performed by imitating biological computing, especially in the selection, crossover, and mutation operations, see Medel-Esquivel et al. (2023). Here, we mention that classical genetic algorithms have been used both for combinational and continu-ous optimization problems. For a simple example of the former, following Mitchell (1996), one uses a bit representation of the genes (similar to the quantum binary encoding, as we will show in § Appendix B.2). The algorithm goes as follows: 

• Start with a randomly generated population of chromo-somes represented by l bits. 

• Calculate the fitness evaluation for each of these chromo-somes. 

• Repeat the operations of crossover and mutation with given probabilities, the former defined as cross over the pair at a randomly chosen point of the string to form two off spring. If no crossover takes place, form two o ff spring that are exact copies of their respective parents. The latter, instead, is a mutation in that given point. These opera-tions are performed on two ”parents” chromosomes, se-lected with a given probability dependent on the previous evaluation of the merit function. 

• Replace the current population with the new population. 

• Repeat these operations until a given generation number is reached. 

• Repeat the entire run to obtain di ff erent results on the ge-netic algorithm to perform statistics on the results. This framework can be used in any problem in which a binary representation is suitable (Eiben and Smith, 2015), thus, it can also be extended to continuous functions, as it has already been done in the literature. Genetic algorithms have been used in a cosmological set-ting, as a way to solve optimization problems. For instance, in Medel-Esquivel et al. (2023); G´ omez-Vargas et al. (2023); G´ omez-Vargas and V´ azquez (2024) there are applications of classical genetic algorithms for the optimization of cosmolog-ical parameters. Here, it is argued that optimization and sam-pling algorithms typically used in a cosmological setting (like the Bayesian posterior inference) are two di ff erent tasks that can be used in conjunction. It is important to stress that in this context, optimization means to find the best-fitting values for the cosmological parameters, while sampling means to ex-plore the posterior distributions, thus allowing for a more com-plete idea of the cosmological parameter space. For instance, the optimization from the genetic algorithm allows one to find the region around the global minimum to sample, thus limit-ing the issues of relative minima in sampling bimodal distri-butions (Medel-Esquivel et al., 2023). It has also been shown that genetic algorithms can be used together with other ma-chine learning methods for cosmological applications (G´ omez-Vargas et al., 2023; G´ omez-Vargas and V´ azquez, 2024). Genetic algorithms have also been used for the reconstruc-tion of cosmological functional forms, going beyond parame-ter inference. Indeed, in Arjona and Nesseris (2020b) genetic algorithms have been used to reconstruct the luminosity dis-tance equation from a sample of SNe Ia. Related to this point, in Alestas et al. (2022), a comprehensive analysis using cos-mological data of di ff erent kinds is shown, for which genetic algorithms are used to reconstruct functions showing possible deviations from the ΛCDM model and General Relativity. 22 Instead, in Orjuela-Quintana et al. (2023), machine learning methods, and in particular genetic algorithms, have been used in relation to the matter transfer function T (k) related to the mat-ter power spectrum P(k, z) for the large-scale structures. Other analyses of this kind can be found in Kamerkar et al. (2023), where genetic algorithms have been used to reconstruct the in-flationary potential via cosmological data, and in Lodha et al. (2024), where genetic algorithms have been used to explore features of the CMB spectra in a model-independent way. For other works of this kind, see also Arjona and Nesseris (2020a, 2021). 

Appendix B.2. Quantum Genetic algorithms: an overview 

Having presented some applications of quantum computing to cosmological problems, we now show some examples of quantum genetic algorithms, and more general optimization routines involving QC, already implemented in the literature. For a more general introduction on QC, we refer to § Appendix A. Here, we will show some details relevant to our algorithm. The vast majority of optimization problems in gate-based QC can be divided into two main categories (Abbas et al., 2024): algorithms implemented to solve combinatorial problems, and those whose main goal is to find the ground state of a given Hamiltonian. For the former, the most implemented is the Quantum Ap-proximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA, Farhi et al. 2014), which is a hybrid iterative method successfully applied to com-binatorial problems, among which the max-cut problem: i.e, partition nodes of a graph in a way that maximizes the number of edges between nodes in di ff ering groups. QAOA are one of the most interesting class of quantum algorithms from a com-putational complexity point of view, giving promising results for a variety of applications. For more details see Wang et al. (2018); Blekos et al. (2024) In the second group, the most popular class of algorithms is known as the Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQA, Cerezo et al. 2021). These are hybrid algorithms that use classical op-timization routines to train parametrized quantum circuits, i.e. circuits composed of rotational gates (like the ones shown in Eq. A.8 in § Appendix A) depending on parameters θ to be found by the routine itself as the best solution for the prob-lem under study. These can also be linked to quantum ma-chine learning algorithms (Benedetti et al., 2019; Farsian et al., 2025a). We stress that neither of the aforementioned classes of algo-rithms applies directly to our case. We now go more into detail in the literature regarding quan-tum genetic algorithms. The interjection of quantum comput-ing and evolutionary algorithms has been studied before the birth of proper quantum hardware (Spector et al., 1998; Han and Kim, 2000; Spector, 2004; Sofge, 2008). Here, the first concepts of evolutionary algorithms applied to quantum com-puting have been theoretically analyzed, finding applications for combinational optimization problems as well as Deutsch’s Early Promise Problem for the nature of the qubits (Deutsch, 1985). In Ibarrondo et al. (2022, 2023) a quantum genetic algorithm has been implemented with the goal of minimizing a Hamilto-nian as in the VQA formalism, but with the key di ff erence of not having a classical optimization routine complementing the algorithm nor a parameterized quantum circuit. More specif-ically, in these algorithms, the individuals are quantum regis-ters, each represented by c qubits, i.e. a state |ψi⟩ defined in the Hilbert space Hreg i  (C2)⊗c. A population of n individu-als then spans the composite space Hpop = Nni=1 Hreg i . In other words, each individual in the population is a small quantum reg-ister, and the full population is represented as a tensor product of these registers. The goal is to minimize a target Hamilto-nian Hp by evolving the population of registers with genetic-inspired operations. This is done by ranking the registers based on energy measurements with respect to Hp, and then apply-ing operations of quantum crossovers (i.e, swapping the qubits of given registers) or mutations (mutating a qubit with a given probability). Other quantum genetic algorithms have been designed more as search algorithms, i.e. finding the specific state correspond-ing to the minimum of a function whose form is already known. The idea is to start from one of the most successful quantum algorithms ever implemented, the Grover algorithm (Grover, 1998), which has already proven to be computationally faster than the classical counterpart. Indeed, while classical selec-tion algorithms are of computational cost O(n), where n is the number of array elements in which the selection is taken place, Grover’s quantum algorithm for selection is proven to be of cost 

O( √n) if the oracle (i.e., the black box component of the quan-tum circuit which “knows” what particular state to select as the solution of the problem) of the algorithm is already built. Following this idea, an implementation of a quantum ge-netic algorithm (Lahoz-Beltra, 2016) discretizes the values of the function to be minimized, then binary encodes these dis-crete values in quantum states using their binary representation as follows 

xk −→ | xk⟩ = |b1b2 . . . bn⟩, bi ∈ { 0, 1}. (B.1) Assuming that the position of the minimum is already known, a quantum oracle is built to mark the state correspond-ing to the minimum by applying a phase flip to this state 

O f |x⟩ =



−| x⟩ if x = xmin 

|x⟩ otherwise (B.2) This oracle is then used for Grover’s algorithm to increase the probability that the correct quantum state is selected after the measurement in a few iterations. Another quantum genetic algorithm based on the binary en-coding of continuous functions has been implemented in Acam-pora and Vitiello (2021); Acampora et al. (2022, 2023b,a), called Hybrid Quantum Genetic Algorithm (HQGA). In this case, the use of Grover’s algorithm is avoided, following a dif-ferent scheme for the quantum selection that does not assume knowing the position of the minimum beforehand. Also, an-other, di ff erent, definition of quantum crossover and mutation is 23 implemented, the former by using conditional operations con-sidering ancillary qubits, while the latter as rotations on the main qubits. Finally, the classical merit operation is computed for the selected state. This concept has been implemented for di ff erent benchmark functions and can also be extended to ex-ternal functions. Indeed, as shown in § 5, we implemented this algorithm for our cosmological case, comparing the results with AEQGA. From this summary of the quantum genetic algorithms in the literature, one notices that many di ff erent implementations have been proposed, giving di ff erent meanings to the popula-tion, crossover, and mutation concepts, while keeping the core idea of an evolutionary algorithm. Our AEQGA follows this scheme. 

Appendix C. Reliability Tests 

In this appendix, we present some reliability tests we have performed to test the validity of our approximations on the χ2

functions to be minimized as well as the performance of AE-QGA with di ff erent functions. 

Appendix C.1. Testing the approximations on the objective functions 

Firstly, we investigate whether having precomputed the lu-minosity distance entering the SNe Ia data comparison impacts the estimate of the objective function. To this end, we produce two maps varying the number of steps in ΩM over the range (0.0, 0.5) where we pre-compute the integrals. We then rescale the di ff erence maps with respect to the fiducial one (i.e., the top panel of Fig. 3, computed analytically) shown in Fig. C.13. Note that ΩM is the only parameter entering the integral in Eq. (3). We note the very small di ff erence between the pre-computed maps and the original one, especially in the region with the smallest value for the objective function, which is also the re-gion we wish to study in our analysis. This test has demon-strated that we can use both strategies for the pre-computation. Indeed, we used the 100 pre-computed integrals to infer gen-eral statistical information from the results, and the 300 pre-computed integrals to draw the plots we show in our analysis. A similar check has been done for the TT spectra of the CMB, comparing the results by CAMB with the ones de-rived from the pre-computed spectra and PICO . For the pre-computation, we have chosen three grids: (30, 30), (50, 50), and (70, 70) di ff erent values for ΩM and H0, selected in the same intervals considered for the SNe Ia. The paucity of grid points compared with the SNe Ia test is due to the more intensive and time-consuming computations involved in the evaluation of the di ff erent spectra. The comparisons are shown in Fig. C.14. Increasing the number of pre-computed spectra increases the precision of the results, as expected. We also note how, in the region around the absolute minimum PICO shows homogeneity and smoothness in its contours, thus does not artificially create local minima in the objective function, but its results are worse than the pre-computed spectra in regions far from the absolute minimum. Thus, we used this emulator for our experiments involving the CMB + BAO dataset. 

Appendix C.2. Tests on simulated datasets 

To understand if our results are consistent with a cosmolog-ical model used to create mock data, we simulate a dataset of luminosity distances logarithmically equispaced in the redshift interval [0.01, 2]. These have been created in a flat ΛCDM model with ΩM = 0.3 and H0 = 70, adding error bars on the data and a Gaussian dispersion around the curve given by the input model, thus having data spread around it rather than per-fectly aligned on it, as one expects from a real dataset. We performed six tests. In the first four, we simulated 1000 luminosity distances, then we added an error equal to 5% , 10% , 15% , and 20% of the simulated luminosity distance and a Gaussian dispersion with a standard deviation equal to the errors themselves. Then, we fixed the errors and the disper-sion to the 10% and used smaller sets of 100 and 500 simulated luminosity distances, respectively. All the results are shown in Fig. C.15, with: ng = 50, ni = 300, np = 32, and crossover and mutation probabilities = 0.5, following the previously men-tioned general scheme. For the study of these hyperparameters and their e ff ects on the results derived from the real data, see 

§ 4. In these panels, the black dots are the results of AEQGA, for which the means and covariance ellipses have been de-rived, while the underlying contours are the analytical 1 , 2,

and 3 σ contours of the objective function computed from the mock datasets. We conclude that AEQGA is always consis-tent with the minimum of the objective function (which di ff ers from the input cosmology given the dispersion we have sim-ulated) within 1 σ. The ellipse of the quantum results follows roughly the same shape and orientation as the ones given by the analytical objective function, while its size is independent of the underlying analytical dispersion, meaning that is mainly dependent on the hyperparameters of the algorithm itself than the shape of the underlying objective function. To link the re-sults of AEQGA with the shape of the function, we interpolated the contour levels of the χ2 function for the mock data, starting from the results of AEQGA. The idea is to see if we can recover the analytical contours, while showing the di ff erence with the covariance uncertainty on the minimum. The results are shown in Fig. C.16, where we focused on the χ2 function for the 5% error and dispersion. We recovered the analytical σ contours from our results, and we note the di ff erence with the uncertainty covariance matrix. Given that the experiments performed in § 4concern merit functions we can analytically evaluate, and the scope of AEQGA, in our analysis we focused on the statisti-cal uncertainties. Still, the possibility of recovering the contour levels from our results is worth mentioning. As a further test for AEQGA, we considered a 2D negative peak Gaussian function, with the absolute minimum in (0,0) and variable standard deviation. From this, we took into ac-count two cases, one with a wide Gaussian ( σ = 0.5), and the other with a narrow dispersion ( σ = 0.005). The idea is see if, under the same hyperparameters, the dispersion of the re-sults depends on the underlying width of the function. What we 24 0.30 0.32 0.34 0.36 0.38 0.40

Figure C.14: The fractional di ff erence, as computed in Fig. C.13, between the map for the objective function derived by pre-computing the TT spectrum for the CMB for di ff erent couples of values of ΩM and H0 between 0 and 0.5 and 60 and 80, respectively.

found is that, with ng = 50, AEQGA does not always converge in the region around the minimum for σ = 0.005, but when it does, it is more precise than for σ = 0.5, thus showing a di ff er-ence due the shape of the function. For ng = 500, instead, we obtain precise results in both cases. Related to this point, as a further way to trace contours from the results of AEQGA, we have tested a way to infer the con-tours of the objective functions used for our analysis via an ap-proximation related to the Fisher matrices around the minima found by the AEQGA. More specifically, we approximate the local curvature around the best–fit point (i. e., the point with the lowest value for the objective function found by the AEQGA) 25 Figure C.15: The results for AEQGA with the mock dataset.

ε2 (C.2) where ei is the unit vector along θi. We then take the Fisher information matrix as F ≡ 2H, where the 2 comes from the fact that we are treating a χ2 function and not the log-likelihood. Under the Gaussian–likelihood (quadratic) approximation, the parameter covariance is C = F−1 and the 1-σ marginalized un-certainties are 

σi = pCii . (C.3) In applying this computation to the merit function of the SNe Ia and comparing the contours obtained in this way with the an-alytical ones, we get the results shown in the left panel of Fig. C.17. Here, we note how this methodology recovers almost ex-actly the analytical contours of the χ2 SNe Ia function. The small di ff erence could be due to the fact that our χ2 function is not exactly Gaussian, but presents an asymmetry in the direc-tion of H0, as can be seen in the right panel of Fig. C.17. This allows us to conclude that, even if the main focus of AEQGA is minimization, it is still possible to infer from its results an esti-mate of the contours of the objective function. The caveat here is that this method requires the direct computation of the objec-tive function around the minimum, which could be troublesome for more complex cosmological χ2 especially when considering high-dimensional multi-parameter spaces. 27 0.25 0.30 0.35 0.40 0.45
