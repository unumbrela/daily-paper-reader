Abstract 

The fusion of rigorous physical laws with flexible data -driven learning represents a new 

frontier in scientific simulation, yet bridging the gap between physical interpretability and 

computational efficiency remains a grand challenge. In  electron  microscopy, this divide limits 

the ability to quantify three -dimensional topography from two -dimensional projections, 

fundamentally constraining our understanding of nanoscale structure -function relationships. 

Here, we present a physics -embedded neural com putationa l microscopy framework that 

achieves metrological three -dimensional reconstruction by deeply coupling a differentiable 

electron -optical forward model with deep learning. By introducing a ‘Vision Field Transformer’ 

as a high -speed, differentiable surrogate  for  physical  process  analysis  simulations , we 

establish an end -to -end, self -supervised optimization loop that enforces strict physical 

consistency with hardware geometry. This synergy enables single -shot, quantitative three -

dimensional nanometrology with precision comparable to atomic force micros copy but at 

orders of magnitude higher throughput. Furthermore, we demonstrate the capability for 

‘four -dimen sional (three -dimensional real space  + time)’ in -situ characterization by tracking 

the dynamic evolution of  surface nanostructure during  copper -red ox , revealing hidden 

crystallographic kinetics invisible to conventional imaging. Our work not only redefines the 

limits of scanning electron microscopy but also establishes a generalizable archetype for 

solving ill -posed inverse problems across physical sci ences, unlocking the full potential of 

simulation as a third pillar of discovery. 

Introduction 

Physical simulation has become the third major pillar of science and engineering, alongside theory and experiment 1, 2 . The field is now undergoing a clear shift in paradigm: on 

one hand, traditional methods grounded in physical laws are rigorous and testable, but often 

come with a high computational cost; on the other hand, data -driven methods based on 

neural networks ar e efficient and can fit complex patterns well, yet they often lack physical 

constraints and therefore offer limited interpretability and robustness when conditions 

change 3. A central question, then, is how to combine physical trustworthiness with data 

efficiency —and build new simulation/inversion frameworks that are both fast and highly 

reliable. 

Three -dimensional  (3D)  surface imaging in electron optics is governed by complete 

classical physics, yet it faces severe computational bottlenecks due to the complexity of 

electron scattering and trajectory evolution 4, 5 . This makes it an ideal testbed for the “physics –

data fusion” paradigm. At the micro - and nanoscale, accurately revealing the 3D structure of 

materials and biological systems is essential for understanding how function emerges 6, 7, 8 .

However, as microscopy moves from “capturing high -quality  two -dimensional (2D)  images” 

toward “quantitative 3D topography measurement” 9, the missing depth information in the 

imaging process becomes a key barrier: existing SEM images are still, in essence, intensity 

projections of 3D space onto a 2D plane, and they do not directly provide a height field with 

metrological meaning. To addres s this challenge, we introduce a closed -loop 3D metrology 

framework that tightly couples a differentiable electron -optics forward model with deep -

learning -based inversion, which we name ECLIPS (Electron -contrast –constrained Learning 

with an Interpretable P hysics Surrogate).  ECLIPS aims to deliver high -fidelity reconstruction 

of microscopic 3D topography without compromising imaging efficiency. By design, 

reconstruction quality should be bounded primarily by hardware performance rather than 

algorithmic or procedural confounder s, thereby providing a high -precision, high -throughput, 

and verifiable pathway for quantitative microscopy metrology. 

As a cornerstone tool for micro/nanoscale characterization, scanning electron 

microscopy (SEM) is widely used for both static structure inspection and tracking dynamic 

processes, thanks to its intuitive imaging and convenient operation 10 

. SEM forms images by 

scanning a focused electron beam point by point and collecting secondary -electron (SE) and 

backscattered -electron (BSE) signals 11 . Although SE is sensitive to surface relief  and BSE is 

more sensitive to material composition 12, 13 , and although the relative geometry between the 

sample and detector can introduce directional shading and a sense of “3D appearance” to 

some extent 12 , the output is still a 2D contrast image 14  without direct depth calibration. As a 

result, recovering accurate 3D surface topography from 2D SEM/BSE contrast is 

fundamentally limited by information loss caused by dimensionality collapse, leading to an 

ill -posed inverse problem 15, 16 

.

A range of existing 3D reconstruction approaches have attempted to tackle this inverse 

problem, yet it remains difficult to meet both high accuracy and high efficiency at the same 

time. Multi -view reconstruction acquires images from different viewing angle s by tilting the 

specimen stage 17 ; it is conceptually straightforward, but is limited by mechanical precision, 

operational space, and time cost, making fast and stable continuous measurement 

challenging 18, 19 . Methods inspired by optical photometric stereo attempt to infer geometry from “illumination changes” 20, 21 , but electron motion and scattering in electromagnetic fields 

are far more complex than optical light paths 22, 23 . Directly transferring optical assumptions can 

introduce systematic physical bias and undermine metrological accuracy. Purely data -driven 

black -box learning can fit data, but without physical constraints it is often sensitive to changes 

in imaging conditi ons (such as voltage, working distance, detector relative position, material 

differences, and so on) 24 , and thus struggles to deliver the stability and verifiability required 

for scientific metrology 3.

To bridge the gap between physical fidelity and reliable imaging, our goal is to build a 

general, robust, and interpretable 3D metrology reconstruction framework. ECLIPS makes a 

key choice at the signal level: instead of using SE, which are more easily aff ected by local 

electric fields and charging, we prioritize BSE, which can be efficiently collected even under 

weak bias and are better suited for building testable physical models 25, 26 . This strategy reduces 

uncontrolled field -induced effects on electron trajectories, providing a “cleaner” physical basis 

for constructing a high -confidence electron -optics forward model and a unified 

experimental –simulation reference frame. 

Building on this, ECLIPS adopts a co -design of hardware and algorithms to enable high -

accuracy, high -efficiency reconstruction within a single scan. On the hardware side, we 

integrate and carefully calibrate a four -quadrant  （4Q ） BSE detector inside the microscope, 

so that multiple BSE contrast images carrying directional information can be captured 

simultaneously in one scan, providing well -defined geometric boundary conditions for 

electron -optics modeling. On the algorithm side,  ECLIPS uses a deep network  to estimate the 

surface normal field (normal map) from multi -directional BSE contrast, and then employs a 

differentiable electron -optics forward model to render the normal map into simulated BSE 

contrast that can be directly compared with measurements. Thi s forms a self -supervised 

analysis -by -synthesis loop: by minimizing the photometric consistency residual between 

simulation and observation, backpropagation drives the network to iteratively converge 

toward a physically consistent geometric solution 27 .

After obtaining a high -quality normal field, ECLIPS further needs to convert it into a 

metrologically meaningful 3D depth field (depth map). Classical normal integration methods 

(such as solving the Poisson equation or path integration) can be highly sensi tive —especially 

under noisy normals —to boundary conditions, deviations from integrability, and low -

frequency drift, often leading to global shape drift or stripe -like artifacts 28, 29, 30 . We therefore 

introduce a physics -informed neural network (PINN) as the integrator 31 

. By explicitly enforcing 

global geometric consistency, integrability, and necessary boundary constraints in the loss 

function, we achieve a robust mapping from normal map to depth map, significantly 

suppressing noise -induced low -frequency drift while pres erving key geometric details. 

The value of ECLIPS goes beyond static 3D metrology. Thanks to the efficiency of 

capturing multi -directional information in a single scan, and the consistency and verifiability 

enabled by the physics -constrained closed loop, the framework naturally extends  to frame -

by -frame 3D reconstruction of in situ dynamic processes, offering a feasible path toward “4D 

(3D + time)” metrology. For example, in the redox process on copper surfaces 32 , ECLIPS can stably recover time -resolved 3D evolution and quantitatively resolve nanoscale dynamic 

structures such as step -flow driven by screw dislocations 33 , revealing 3D geometric change 

mechanisms that are hard to capture reliably with traditional 2D contrast imaging.  More 

broadly, the closed -loop design embodied by ECLIPS —“a differentiable physics forward 

model + neural -network inversion” —provides a transferable modeling paradigm for tackling 

ill -posed inverse problems across many physical systems: it retains computati onal efficiency 

while turning physical priors into differentiable, testable constraints, thereby improving the 

scientific credibility and met rological meaning of reconstruction results 31, 34, 35 .

Physics -embedded neural computational microscopy for quantitative three -

dimensional nanometrology 

Fig. 1 | ECLIPS: physics -embedded neural computational microscopy for quantitative 

three -dimensional SEM reconstruction. 

(a)  Data acquisition. A customized 4Q -BSE detector mounted beneath the SEM pole piece 

records four azimuth -resolved BSE images in a single scan from the specimen on a geometry -calibrated stage (optionally with in situ actuation/heating). These four images form the multi -

view SEM input stack for reconstruction.  (b) , From BSE images to a normal map, then back to 

SEM for self -consistency. The  4Q -SEM stack from a is fed into a U -Net –style neural backbone 

to predict a surface normal map (right). The predicted normal map is then passed to the 

Vision Field Transformer (VFT) forward renderer to generate simulated SEM images 

corresponding to the same  4Q  views. A finetuning module further  adjusts the simulated SEM 

to match measurement appearance. The simulated/finetuned SEM is compared with the real 

SEM input to compute an image -consistency loss, and this loss is used to update the 

reconstruction network (closing the self -supervised loop in dicated by the arrows).  (c) , How 

the forward renderer synthesizes SEM contrast. Given the predicted surface geometry (from 

the normal map), the forward model determines, for each pixel and each quadrant, the valid 

solid angle set by the detector geometry a nd instrument settings, the exposed angle set by 

local surface visibility/occlusion, and their intersection (visible subset). This visible subset 

governs the quadrant -wise BSE intensity used to produce the simulated SEM images that 

feed back into the loss  in  (b) . (d) , From normal map to quantitative depth and validation. The 

optimized normal map from b is converted into a depth/height map using a physics -informed 

integrator (PINN block). The resulting 3D topography is reported as a rendered surface and 

line  profiles, and is validated by cross -modal comparison to AFM height maps and FIB –TEM 

cross -sectional measurements (analysis panel). Scale bars as indicated. 

To overcome the inherent limits of conventional surface -topography methods in accuracy, 

speed, and applicability to non -equilibrium dynamics, we developed the ECLIPS framework. 

ECLIPS tightly couples a hardware imaging system customized for backscattered -electron 

(BSE) imaging with a differentiable electron -optics model, aiming for an end -to -end 

quantitative inversion from 2D BSE contrast images to 3D surface topography. As shown in 

Fig. 1, ECLIPS establishes a complete closed loop from hardware acquisition  to 3D 

reconstruction, integrating electron -optics simulation with self -supervised optimization. The 

workflow consists of three coordinated components:  Fig. 1a  shows the hardware setup and 

experimental data acquisition;  Fig. 1b  presents the core deep -learning module; and  Fig. 1c 

illustrates the physics simulation architecture based on electron -optics principles. By 

integrating these modules in a self -consistent way, we achieve accurate reconstruction from 

multi -directional BSE contrast images to a 3D topogr aphy matrix, and we further confirm 

metrology -level accuracy and strong performance at the nanoscale through multimodal 

cross -validation with AFM and FIB -TEM ( Fig. 1d ). 

First, on the acquisition side, we designed and integrated a  4Q -BSE detector based on 

electron -optics imaging geometry, enabling the system to capture, in a single scan, four BSE 

images that carry different azimuthal -direction information ( Fig. 1a ). The detector is placed 

beneath the SEM pole piece and forms a fixed relative geometry with the specimen stage. By 

calibrating the detector’s spatial position and key operating parameters (such as accelerating 

voltage and working distance), we obtain hig h signal -to -noise BSE measurements while also 

establishing accurate geometric boundary conditions for later modeling. This aligns 

experimental observations and electron -optics forward simulation within a shared reference 

frame. Notably, to support external fields a nd environmental disturbances that commonly arise in in situ studies, the specimen -stage module further integrates a local laser -heating 

unit and provides reserved/compatible interfaces for controlled -atmosphere (environmental) 

imaging and control ( Fig. 1a ). This allows the  4Q  acquisition scheme to extend to 3D 

topography tracking during dynamic processes under controlled gas and heating conditions. 

Together, the geometric calibration and system integration provide well -defined physical 

boundary conditions for subsequent BSE ph ysics simulation, elect ron -trajectory prediction, 

and quantitative 3D reconstruction —forming the foundation for metrological inversion. 

Building on the hardware and geometric calibration, we constructed a matching 

computational inversion module that converts the multi -directional information from the  4Q -

BSE signals into geometric representations suitable for 3D reconstruction. As shown in  Fig. 

1b , in the core deep -learning module we use U -Net -Style network  as the backbone network 36, 

> 37, 38

, learning an initial mapping from multi -azimuth BSE contrast images to a surface normal 

map. Because inferring 3D geometry from 2D intensity observations is inherently ill -posed 15 ,

a purely data -driven model can easily absorb empirical biases that strongly depend on 

imaging conditions. To obtain a stable initialization and speed up convergence, we first adopt 

a supervised pretraining strategy: we compute normal fields from AFM heig ht maps of the 

same region as training labels, and use machine -learning -based registration to achieve strict 

spatiotemporal alignment 39, 40 

. However, AFM data inevitably contains error sources such as 

tip -trailing artifacts and registration residuals 41 , meaning the supervisory signal itself is noisy. 

In addition, purely data -driven mappings often generalize poorly across changes in operating 

conditions such as accelerating voltage, making pretrained results relatively coarse and 

limiting robustness acro ss experiments. 

To address this domain gap problem, we introduce an electron -optics forward model into 

ECLIPS and build a physics -guided deep -learning simulation pipeline ( Fig. 1c ). Based on the 

precise spatial calibration described above and electron -optics principles, we build the BSE 

Simulation Model (BSESM), which can rigorously simulate BSE emission and flight trajectories 

at the pixel level and provide a forward mapping from  3D surface topography to 2D BSE 

contrast distributions. However, conventional BSESM computati on is extremely expensive: 

under typical computing resources, a single iteration can take tens of hours, and the forward 

process is non -differentiable, preventing seamless integration into gradient -based training. 

To overcome this bottleneck, we propose a Vision Field assumption based on surface 

statistical properties. Through a rigorous probabilistic derivation, this assumption shows that 

if electrons are not occluded within a specific local radius r centered at th e emission point 

(the Vision Field), then the conditional probability of encountering occlusion in the far field 

quickly decays to a negligible threshold  𝛿 𝑜𝑢𝑡 . This result mathematically reduces a globally 

dependent 3D ray -tracing problem into a lower -dimensional 2D feature -query problem that 

depends only on local neighborhood information. Guided by this, we design the Vision Field 

Transformer (VFT) as an effic ient surrogate for BSESM, using attention mechanisms to 

efficiently resolve local 3D occlusion and visibility on a 2D plane 42, 43 

. Although the statistical 

assumption has boundary limitations in theory at low emission angles (low direction 

thresholds), analysis combining detector geometry and field -driven trajectories shows that 

such low -angle electrons cannot enter the effective so lid angle of the  4Q  detector in the first place. Therefore, while maintaining strict physical fidelity for the effective imaging signal, VFT 

compresses the per -simulation time from ~20 hours to seconds and makes the full pipeline 

differentiable, enabling the physics forward operator to be embedded  into deep -network 

training. 

We then embed VFT as a differentiable Forward Model into the U -Net reconstruction 

framework to form a physics -constrained self -supervised loop: U -Net takes multi -azimuth 

BSE images as input and predicts a normal field; the normal field is rendered by the F orward 

Model into simulated BSE contrast; and a photometric -consistency loss is computed against 

the measured images. During training, the error signal backpropagates to update U -Net 

parameters, forcing the predicted normal field to progressively approach  the true geometry 

under physical constraints. Importantly, even with detailed electron -optics modeling and the 

Vision Field approximation, small systematic differences between simulation and real 

measurements can still remain due to complex surface scatter ing behavior (a sim -to -real 

gap) 44, 45 . To further reduce this residual, we add a lightweight neural refinement module after 

the Forward Model. Using joint features from the normal map and the initial simulated image, 

it adaptively predicts and corrects nonlinear distortions between simulation  and measurement. 

This acts as a data -driven compensation layer for physical -model error, further improving 

image consistency. In addition, for use cases that are extremely latency -sensitive —such as 

large -field, high -throughput statistics or online monitor ing —we build a purely deep -learning 

fast simulator (Deeplearning Simulation Model, DSM) on top of the Forward Model 46 , distilling 

physical knowledge from BSESM/VFT to further reduce the computational complexity of the 

reconstruction framework. 

To rigorously validate the reliability of ECLIPS, we use atomic force microscopy (AFM) and 

focused -ion -beam transmission electron microscopy (FIB -TEM) as ground truth direct 

measurements and conduct multimodal cross -checking ( Fig. 1d ). Specifically, we need to 

solve for a 3D depth field (Depth Map) from the optimized normal map. Unlike traditional 

Poisson -based solvers or path integration methods, in the micro/nanoscale regime studied 

here (overall flat samples with small local height  variations), classical  methods show clear 

limitations: Poisson -based integration is highly sensitive to boundary conditions and noise 28, 

> 29

, and small errors can accumulate into global shape drift or tilt distortion; path integration 

requires a strictly conservative field, and directly integrating noisy predicted normals often 

produces severe stripe -like artifacts 30 . We therefore propose and adopt a physics -informed 

neural network (PINN) integration architecture (Physics -Informed Neural Network, PINN) 31  ,

enabling a robust mapping from Normal Map to Depth Map. In the loss function, we explicitly 

include PDE -residual constraints. This allows deep learning to capture the (potentially 

nonlinear) relationship between the normal field and the height field whi le preserving both 

global geometric consistency and local detail accuracy. Finally, through pixel -level registration 

and multimodal comparison with AFM and FIB -TEM results (see  Fig. 1d  Analysis and 

Comparison), we verify the high accuracy and low -noise properties of the AI reconstruction 

(We will discuss in following), obtaining a 3D surface -topography matrix that is highly 

consistent with experimental observations and theoretical expec tations (as shown in  Fig. 1d 

Final Result and the line profiles). Electronic -optical physical modeling and high -confidence neural surrogate validation

(a) , Geometry -calibrated hardware baseline for multi -azimuth BSE acquisition. The SEM 

column illuminates the specimen while a customized 4Q detector, registered to the specimen 

stage, captures four directional BSE images in a single scan; the colored quadrant  indicator 

and the four example images illustrate the one -to -four mapping from the physical detector 

quadrants to the measured 4Q -BSE set.  (b) , Electron -optical forward simulation under the 

calibrated geometry (shown as a “one -quadrant example” on the l eft and “other quadrants 

analogously” on the right). Left: the detector geometry defines a Valid Solid Angle (yellow 

region), i.e., emission directions that would reach this detector quadrant without considering 

occlusion. The sample topography further def ines an Exposed Angle, i.e., emission directions 

that are not blocked by surrounding relief; red crosses mark representative emission 

directions that are occluded (blocked by local topography) and therefore cannot contribute 

to the detector signal. The Vis ible Angle is the intersection of Valid Solid Angle and Exposed Angle (indicated by “&” and the vertical “Visible Angle” bracket), which then determines the 

simulated intensity for this quadrant (arrow to the “Simulation Result”). Right: the same 

procedure is applied to the other three quadrants (three colored cones),  all feeding into the 

same electronic -optics simulation module to produce the corresponding three simulated 

quadrant images (arrows from “Other Quadrants” → “Electronic Optics Simulation” → output 

images).  (c) , Neural surrogate learning for accelerating the  forward model. A 3D topography 

input is rendered by the high -fidelity BSE simulator (BSESM, used as a teaching model), and 

the resulting paired data supervise an AI -based electronic -optics collision surrogate, forming 

the teacher→student (BSESM→AI) distil lation pathway (arrows).  (d) , Fidelity check of the 

surrogate renderer. The traditional/BSESM simulation and the AI -based simulation are 

compared side -by -side; their pixel -wise discrepancy is summarized as a global difference 

heatmap (arrow “Analysis and Comparison” → heatmap).  (e) , Line -based quantitative 

evaluation. Sampling lines (L1 –L3) are drawn on a reference image (left), then mapped to 

paired intensity profiles (VFT/AI vs BSESM) and corresponding difference quantification for 

each line (arrows from the reference with lines →  profile panels). 

Building on the ECLIPS hardware architecture described above, we next focus on the electron -

optics simulation and the AI -accelerated validation system constructed on this geometric 

reference ( Fig. 2 ). Using the precisely calibrated spatial relationship between the detector and 

the specimen shown in  Fig. 2a , we first establish strict alignment between physical simulation 

and experimental acquisition within the same coordinate frame. This geometric consistency 

ensures that the multi -azimuth BSE signals captured by the detector not only exhibit strong 

directio nal shadowing effects, but also provide reliable experimental ground truth for 

validating the physical fidelity of electron -optics simulation. 

On top of this hardware reference, we develop a first -principles BSE imaging simulator, 

termed the BSE Simulation Model (BSESM), as illustrated in  Fig. 2b . To disentangle the 

imaging mechanism in a complex electromagnetic environment, we decouple the simulation 

into two key stages: the Valid Solid Angle and the Exposed Angle. The former depends only 

on macroscopic microscope parameters (such as the electric -field distribution, working 

distance, and accelerating voltage of the incident electrons). It describ es the range of emission 

directions that can be received by the detector in the absence of occlusion, and can be 

precomputed as a lookup table. Building on that, the Exposed Angle is determined by the 

local 3D geometry of the specimen. It characterizes a v isibility screening of these “receivable” 

emission directions under occlusion by the actual surface topography, reflecting the effective 

emission paths after being blocked by surrounding features. As a result, the final Visible Angle 

can be understood as t he remaining visible subset of the Valid Solid Angle after applying local 

occlusion constraints. Its magnitude and directional distribution then determine the BSE signal 

intensity at each pixel for different detector quadrants. 

Although BSESM can generate highly accurate physical ground truth, it relies on ray tracing 

and Monte Carlo integration, which have extremely high computational complexity and are 

difficult to parallelize. For example, generating a single 1024 × 1024 image  takes more than 

20 hours on a high -performance workstation (e.g., an AMD 9950X CPU). More critically, this 

discrete sampling process is inherently non -differentiable and cannot be directly embedded into gradient backpropagation for deep neural networks, creating a major barrier to end -to -

end optimization. 

To overcome this computational bottleneck, we propose a neural surrogate model based on 

the Vision Field assumption —the Vision Field Transformer (VFT) —and we rigorously validate 

its fidelity ( Fig. 2d ). VFT aims to approximate the physical mapping of BSESM with high 

accuracy in the form of a deep neural network. To train this model, we construct a large 

database of synthetic 3D topographies and introduce multi -scale geometric perturbations 

and surface -roughness augmentation to cover a broad range of material  properties and 

imaging conditions. For optimization, we use the Muon optimizer together with a hard 

example mining strategy 47, 48 , which improves convergence in a high -dimensional parameter 

space and substantially strengthens robustness in complex edges and low signal -to -noise 

regions.  Fig. 2d –e present quantitative comparisons between VFT and conventional BSESM: 

for the same 3D topography input, the simulated image generated by VFT ( Fig. 2d, bottom 

left ) is visually almost indistinguishable from the BSESM ground truth ( Fig. 2d, top left ). Pixel -

wise difference heatmaps ( Fig. 2d, right ) and line -profile intensity analysis ( Fig. 2e ) f urther 

show that the relative error is very small and is mainly confined to high -frequency edge 

regions, confirming the high fidelity of the AI -based simulation. 

More importantly, by leveraging the parallelism of convolutional computation, VFT preserves 

physical accuracy and gradient continuity while reducing computational complexity from 

𝑜 (𝑛 4) to  𝑜 (𝑛 2). This successfully compresses hours of physical simulation into millisecond -

level inference, making VFT the core engine that enables the full closed -loop reconstruction 

system.

(a) , First -principles -inspired BSE simulation pipeline. A 3D sample topography is taken as 

input; the detector geometry determines the admissible/valid emission region in angle space, 

the electrostatic field (visualized as E= −∇ U) governs electron trajectories, and the resulting 

simulated BSE image is compared with a real measurement (simulated  ↔ real).  (b) , Residual 

“finetune ” module for sim -to -real calibration. The predicted normal map and the physics -

rendered (simulated) SEM/BSE image are fed into a lightwei ght neural network; the network suppresses structured bias/noise ( “Remove Noise ”) and outputs a finetuned appearance map. 

(c) , Finetune effectiveness. Predicted (after finetune) and real images are juxtaposed for two 

examples  (c1) , and their agreement is quantified by line profiles  (c2)  under identical sampling 

lines (predicted vs real).  (d) , Normal -to -depth conversion with physics constraints. A U -Net -

based mapper produces a depth map from the normal map, while derivative operators and 

loss terms highlight how normal consistency, PDE res idual, and boundary constraints are 

enforced; illustrative examples  (i –ii)  show input normal  → refined normal  → predicted 

depth, alongside a schematic Poisson -equation view.  (e) , Closed -loop analysis -by -synthesis 

workflow. Quadrant BSE images initialize a model to obtain a normal map; forward simulation 

and finetune produce a rendered image that is compared to measurements to compute 

similarity, and the similarity signal drives m odel updates until convergence, yielding final 

normal and depth maps. 

Building on the hardware reference and the AI acceleration strategy described above, this 

section explains the core physical mechanism that supports ECLIPS: the practical 

implementation of electron -optics simulation, and a data -driven calibration mechanism  that 

corrects the bias introduced by physical approximations.  Fig. 3  presents the full chain from 

first -principles modeling, to residual -learning correction, and finally to depth -field 

integration. 

We first build a numerical simulation framework based on electrostatics and electron -

scattering physics ( Fig. 3a ). The process is divided into two consecutive stages: interaction –

emission and trajectory tracing –detection. The simulation takes a 3D surface -topography 

matrix as input ( Fig. 3a1 ). In the interaction –emission stage, we adopt a single -scattering 

approximation model 4, 49 , and assume that under normal incidence of the primary beam, the 

emission angles of backscattered electrons (BSE) follow the Lambertian Cosine Law 50 

. Given 

that, at the micro/nanoscale, local surface -normal variations typically remain within 60°, we 

further introduce a “local invariance of the diffuse component” assumption to reduce 

computational cost while preserving physical plausibility 23 .

We then move to the trajectory tracing –detection stage. Based on the calibrated imaging 

geometry, we solve the Laplace equation  ∇2𝑈  = 0 to obtain the electric potential 

distribution  𝑈 (𝑥 , 𝑦 , 𝑧 ) between the pole piece and the specimen, and then derive the electric 

field as  𝐸  = −∇𝑈 , as visualized in  Fig. 3a2 . Within this field, we numerically integrate the 

equations of motion for electrons emitted at different angles and trace their trajectories. In 

the coordinate system shown in  Fig. 3a3 , the yellow region indicates the Valid Solid Angle —

the range of initial emission angles that allows electrons to reach the detector’s sensitive area. 

By scanning all pixels on the specimen surface and integrating the Lambertian distribution 

over the Valid  Solid Angle, we generate a theoretical BSE contrast image.  Fig. 3a4  compares 

the simulated image (left) with the experimentally acquired image (right). The strong 

agreement in geometric structures and shadow distributions establishes a physical fo undation 

for the downstream learning -based inversion. 

Despite capturing the dominant imaging behavior, BSESM still introduces unavoidable 

systematic bias when handling complex 3D surfaces, due to the diffuse -component approximation. This bias appears as nonlinear distortion in local contrast, and is fundamentally 

linked to multiple -scattering effects and non -Lambertian behavior on complex topographies. 

To correct this theoretical error without breaking the global constraints of the physical model, 

we model the bias as structured noise and propose a physics –data dual -driven residual 

calibration (“Finetune”) mechanism ( Fig. 3b ). In this design, the BSESM simulation provides 

the global physical backbone, while a lightweight neural network takes the predicted normal 

map and the initial simulated image as inputs, and is trained end -to -end to implicitly learn 

and compensate the sys tematic bias. 

The improvement is shown clearly in  Fig. 3c . After Finetune, the corrected simulated image 

(Fig. 3c1 Predicted ) closely matches the experimental data ( Fig. 3c1 Real ) in both intensity 

distribution and texture details. The line -profile comparison ( Fig. 3c2 ) further confirms that 

the corrected curve (blue) aligns with the real signal (red), effectively closing the final sim -to -

real gap. 

After accurate reconstruction of the 2D normal field, the final challenge is to convert it into a 

metrologically meaningful 3D Depth Map ( Fig. 3d ). Mathematically, this corresponds to 

integrating the normal field. However, classical approaches (such as Poisson solvers or path 

integration) are extremely sensitive to noise at the micro/nanoscale, often causing low -

frequency drift or artifacts 29 .

To address this, we build a physics -informed neural network (PINN) integrator. Instead of 

relying on a purely mathematical solver, the network is supervised using spatial coordinate 

pairs generated from a large set of AFM data, and directly predicts the de pth scalar field. 

Crucially, we inject physical constraints explicitly into the loss function, including:  PDE Residual: 

enforcing zero curl of the depth gradient to satisfy integrability.  Normal Consistency: ensuring 

the surface normals derived from the pr edicted depth align with the input normal field. 

Neumann Boundary Condition: regularizing derivative behavior at the boundary. 

This design combines the precision of data supervision with the robustness of physics 

constraints. As shown in  Fig. 3d(i, ii) , even for surfaces with very small height -to -width ratios, 

the normals computed back from the predicted depth (middle) match the input normals (left), 

and the final depth map (right) is free of artifacts and drift. 

In summary,  Fig. 3e  outlines the overall ECLIPS workflow: starting from  4Q -BSE image 

acquisition, a U -Net produces an initial normal field; VFT/DSM performs physics -based 

simulation followed by Finetune correction; and a similarity loss between simulated and 

measured images is computed. This error signal drives iterative model up dates until 

convergence. This self -supervised closed loop based on analysis -by -synthesis ensures that 

the final normal field and depth map not only fit the data, but also strictly f ollow the physical 

laws of electron optics 51 .

and the outputs corresponding 3D map of ECLIPS (right); colored labels ( A/B/C and their 

counterparts) indicate consistent sampling locations across modalities, while the associated 

4Q BSE images of the same field are shown on the far right.  (c) , Profile -based metrology. Height profiles extracted at the labeled positions compare AFM, commercial 3D detector, and 

ECLIPS(gray background), including representative step/terrace geometry (e.g., slope/step -

3D map, which is then forwarded through the simulator to synthesize BSE images; re -running 

the same reconstruction on the simulated BSE yields a second 3D map (real BSE  → 3D  →

simulated BSE  → simulated -based 3D), and the paired line prof iles quantify the self -

consistency. 

Using the ECLIPS framework, we achieve end -to -end reconstruction from  4Q -BSE contrast 

images to 3D surface topography, and we validate its generality and robustness on multiple 

nanoscale samples with representative topological features. As shown in  Fig. 4a , we apply the 

trained model to unseen samples that were not included during training: step -bunching 

structures on graphene -on -copper surfaces, as well as complex topographies with 

amorphous oxide textures. The figure presents two complete reconstruction e xamples, 

including the input  4Q -BSE contrast images, the predicted normal maps, and the derived 

depth maps. The results show that the framework preserves extremely high fidelity for both 

low -frequency undulations in flat regions and high -frequency discontinuities at step edges, 

demonstra ting strong generalization across diverse nanoscale morphologies. 

To assess metrology -level accuracy, we perform a quantitative multimodal comparison using 

the graphene –copper -foil sample as an example (Fig. 4b –c). We benchmark our 

reconstructed 3D topography against atomic force microscopy (AFM, used as ground truth) 

and a widely used commercial 3D detector solution. The rendered surfaces ( Fig. 4b ) show 

that the commercial 3D -detector software introduces noticeable smoothing and noise 

artifacts when handling micro/nanoscale details, leading to blurred step edges. In cont rast, 

ECLIPS reconstructs sharp edge geometry, and its overall flatness is almost indistinguishable 

from the AFM height field. The cross -sectional height profiles in  Fig. 4c  further quantify this 

advantage: our reconstruction closely overlaps with AFM measurements, with the step -angle 

deviation controlled within 0.2°, which is substantially better than the 1 –2° systematic error of 

the commercial detector solution. These resul ts confirm that physics -embedded deep 

learning not only mitigates the ill -posedness  of the inverse problem, but also reaches 

metrology -grade performance in geometric quantification and edge preservation. 

We further design a closed -loop reconstruct –simulate –reconstruct validation, a cycle -

consistency test, to verify the self -consistency between ECLIPS and the physical imaging 

process ( Fig. 4d ). The procedure is as follows: we first reconstruct an initial depth map from 

real BSE images ( Depth Map 1 ), feed it into the electron -optics forward model (BSESM) to 

generate simulated BSE images, and then send the simulated images back into the same 

reconstruction network to obtain a second depth map ( Depth Map 2 ). Co mparative analysis 

shows that the two depth maps —one from real signals and the other from simulated 

signals —are highly consistent at the pixel level. The recovered 3D structures differ only by 

negligible random perturbations, and their height -profile curve s almost perfectly overlap. 

This closed -loop test demonstrates that our method establishes a robust bijective mapping 

between the 2D BSE imaging space and 3D surface topography, effectively avoiding the 

systematic biases commonly seen in traditional one -wa y modeling. It further confirms that the reconstruction is physically constrained, laying a solid foundation for subsequent in situ 

tracking of non -equilibrium dynamics.

the two marked traces, showing agreement between the reconstructed height and the AFM 

reference across step transitions. 

To rigorously define the capability limits of ECLIPS in accuracy, stability, and spatial resolution, 

we need a nanoscale “ruler” sample that (i) has a clear geometric ground truth, and (ii) appears naturally under SEM conditions and can be repeatedly measured. With this in mind, we 

choose graphene -induced step bunches on copper surfaces as our validation platform. These 

structures are widespread across large fields of view, and locally they exhibit r egular layered 

step geometries. Their formation is also constrained by crystallography, giving them a rare 

combination of being both measurable and mechanistically interpretable —making them an 

ideal benchmark for testing whether a 3D inversion truly reache s metrology -grade reliability. 

As shown in  Fig. 5a , we first locate step -rich regions within a field of view on the order of 20 

μm, and then progressively zoom in to a representative nanoscale field of view. This 

hierarchical zooming is not merely “framing the image”; it reflects a key requirement for 

pra ctical microscopy: rapidly finding targets at the macro scale on complex surfaces, and then 

performing high -fidelity 3D metrology at the local scale —within the same closed -loop 

imaging and modeling system. We then scan the same region us ing contact -mode AFM to 

obtain a height matrix as a direct topographic reference ( Fig. 5b ). In parallel, the  4Q -BSE 

detector acquires four BSE contrast images with different directional information in a single 

scan ( Fig. 5c ). These complementary directional -shadow cues provide boundary conditions 

for electron -optics forward modeling and serve as the observation inputs to the 

reconstruction network. 

Feeding the  4Q -BSE data into the ECLIPS framework yields the corresponding 3D height 

matrix ( Fig. 5d ). The reconstruction matches the AFM height field not only in step orientation, 

step density patterns, and overall undulation, but —more importantly —also shows clear 

geometric turning points and stable slope faces at step edges. This avoids a common failur e

mode of empirical mappings or weakly constrained inversions, where the global shape may 

look plausible but local edge geometry is overly smoothed. To push  this agreement from 

“visual similarity” to metrological consistency, we extract and compare cross -sectional profiles 

from two representative regions ( Fig. 5e1, 5e2 ). The results show that the reconstructed 

profiles reproduce the step -height changes and edge -transition features observed by AFM, 

demonstrating that the framework not only recovers low -frequency topography but also 

preserves sufficient sharpness and stru ctural realism in high -frequency geometry. 

Importantly, by comparing the spatial detail visible in the raw BSE contrast images with that 

in the reconstructed depth map, we confirm that ECLIPS does not introduce an additional 

scale -shrinking mechanism. Under our SEM settings, the effective imaging r esolution is ~1.1 

nm (see SI); correspondingly, the reconstructed depth map resolves geometric detail down 

to a comparable scale (~1.1 nm). This alignment indicates that the achievable spatial 

resolution is not dominated by algorithmic priors or numerical  regularization, but is primarily 

limited by the intrinsic imaging resolution and sampling conditions of the SEM. In other words, 

under physically consistent constraints, ECLIPS avoids systematic bias against high -frequency 

geometry and prevents “algorithmi c de -sharpening”. The recoverable detail scale is 

determined by the effective information limit provided by the instrument itself, which 

mechanistically supports high -resolution, low -bias 3D metrology reconstruction at nanoscale 

step edges. 

Unveiling 4D spatiotemporal dynamics of surface structure Fig. 6 | In -situ 4D (3D + time) nanometrology of redox -driven Cu surface evolution. 

(a) , Group 1 (screw dislocation): time -resolved 4Q BSE inputs and reconstructed 3D outputs. 

For each time point (rows from  𝑡 0 to  𝑡 0 + 15s ), the left panel shows the input BSE set ( 4Q 

mosaic), which is mapped by the reconstruction pipeline to the corresponding output 3D 

height map on the right (Input BSE Set → Output 3D Set), enabling frame -by -frame tracking 

of the defect -associated spiral topography.  (b) , Group 2 (surface terrace): the same in -situ 

reconstruction applied to a terrace/step -bunch region over later frames (rows from  𝑡 0 + 20s 

to  𝑡 0 + 35s ); each row pairs the measured 4Q BSE mosaic with the reconstructed 3D map 

(Input → Output), showing consistent geometry over time.  (c) , Crystallography -guided 

geometric readout for Group 1 at a selected frame/region (linked from the boxed area). A 

height line profile is extracted (arrow) to measure facet/step angles, and the inset Wulff 

polyhedron summarizes the low -index facet configura tion in Cu 2O consistent with the 

measured angles; the accompanying map visualizes in -plane directional relations (e.g., 

orthogonality) within the analyzed patch.  (d) , Analogous analysis for Group 2 at a later time 

point (linked from the boxed area). A line profile quantifies terrace slopes/dihedral angles, 

while the in -plane intersection/angle map (e.g., ~135°) and Wulff -based facet annotation 

provide a crystallograph ic consistency check for the time -resolved 3D reconstruction. After establishing geometric accuracy, physical consistency, and fine spatial resolution for 

static topography, we further extend the framework to probe non -equilibrium surface -

evolution dynamics and assess its potential for in situ “4D (3D + time)” charac terization. 

Crucially, BSE imaging can be performed under  realistic gaseous environments , enabling 

direct observation of reaction -induced contrast variations during ongoing surface processes. 

This capability allows us to monitor solid –gas interfacial chemical reactions in their intrinsically 

non -equilibrium states and to quantify the accompany ing 3D morphological evolution over 

time. 

As shown in  Fig. 6 , we use the dynamic redox process on copper surfaces as a model system 32 .

We perform continuous 3D monitoring of reaction -induced microstructural evolution  under 

121 Pa (H 2 : O 2 = 5 : 1).  For each frame in the video sequence, we reconstruct 3D topography 

from the  4Q -BSE images using ECLIPS, and introduce spatial registration to obtain a dynamic 

3D trajectory that is spatially self -consistent and temporally continuous 39, 52 

. This turns 

conventional in situ electron -microscopy videos —traditionally limited to surface work -

function -related contrast —into data with trackable, quantifiable 3D metrological meaning. 

As shown in  Fig. 6a –b, we reconstruct eight consecutively acquired sets of  4Q -BSE contrast 

images and analyze two representative crystallographic structures.  Group 1  focuses on Cu 2O

spiral dislocations that are extremely difficult to identify in BSE contrast. In conventional 2D 

BSE images, the dislocation -core region ( Fig. 6a Input BSE Set ) appears only as a very weak 

local contrast disturbance, easily buried by background noise and texture variations. With 

ECLIPS, these subtle signals are greatly amplified  and presented as clear 3D structures: the 

time -resolved height maps reveal the characteristic spiral step morphology around the 

dislocation core, where steps rise in a helical pattern along the dislocation line. The topological 

location, spiral sense, and  geometric relation to lattice orientation become immediately visible 

in 3D ( Fig. 6a Output 3D Set ), enabling a qualitative jump from “hidden in 2D” to “revealed 

in 3D”. More importantly, the reconstruction does not merely detect the presence of steps; it 

stably tracks subtle frame -to -frame changes in local curvature, step height, and step spacing, 

providing a direct observational window into defect -driven surface dynamics. 

Group 2  shows the evolution of Cu 2O steps formed by more visually apparent surface 

oxidation ( Fig. 6b Input BSE Set ). Unlike spiral -dislocation morphology, step bunches are 

often easier to notice in 2D contrast. However, the key for understanding surface -energy 

evolution is not qualitative recognition, but whether one can stably quantify step migration, 

slope angles, a nd local rearrangements. The time series in  Fig. 6  shows that ECLIPS can 

continuously reconstruct the 3D morphology of the step bunches durin g the surface reaction 

(Fig. 6b Output 3D Set ), while maintaining consistent geometric scale and directionality 

across time. This advances step evolution from qualitative description to measurable, time -

dependent facet parameters. 

To further verify the physical realism and accuracy of ECLIPS 4D reconstruction, we perform 

cross -checks in  Fig. 6c –d using geometric cross -sectional analysis for the two structure types 

(Fig. 6c  at time t0, and  Fig. 6d  at time t0 + 35 s). We use the low -index facet combinations 

and dihedral -angle relations implied by the Cu 2O Wulff construction as crystallographic 

constraints for validation 53 

.For the spiral -dislocation -related structure ( Fig. 6c ), the reconstructed depth map shows an 

approximately square plateau near the dislocation core. The in -plane boundaries are mutually 

orthogonal, indicating a clear fourfold symmetry. To connect this in -plane geometry to real 

facet orientation, we select a  line cut perpendicular to one plateau edge (black arrow in  Fig. 

6c ) and extract a height line profile. We then fit a local tangent over the plateau -to -sidewall 

transition to obtain an effective slope ang le. The characteristic angle from this profile (about 

134° when expressed as an external angle, corresponding to a 46° inter -slope angle) is 

consistent with the dihedral -angle relation between the {100} top facet and the {110} side 

facet in the Cu 2O Wulff construction. Together with the geometric constraints of a square top 

facet (the in -plane symmetry of {100}) and equivalent surrounding sidewalls, this morphology 

can be attributed to a crystallographic configuration with a {100} top surface bounde d

circum ferentially by {110} side facets. In this way, the reconstructed dislocation -related steps 

and slopes are not only geometrically self -consistent, but also satisfy the facet orientations 

and angle relations expected from crystallography -selective growth of  Cu 2O. 

For the surface -step structure ( Fig. 6d ), the reconstructed depth map shows two step families 

intersecting in -plane with an intersection angle of about 135°. We extract a height line profile 

within the selected region along one step direction (black arrow in  Fig. 6d ), and fit a local 

tangent on the slope segment to obtain an effective slope angle. This slope angle follows the 

same geometric relation implied by the ~135° external -angle feature. Jointly comparing the 

in -plane intersection angle and the cross -sectional slope angle with the Cu 2O Wulff 

construction suggests that this crossed -step geometry can be explained by a {100} top facet 

together with side facets jointly constrained by the {110} and {111} low -index facet families —

namely, a {100} -up configuration where {110}/{111} facets part icipate in forming the 

corresponding ridges and intersection angles. Therefore, both the measured step intersection 

angle and the profile -derived slope angle in  Fig. 6d  fall within the facet -combination and 

dihedral -angle  relations allowed by the Wulff construction. This crystallography -based 

analysis further supports the physical trustworthiness and accuracy of the time -series 

reconstructions produced by ECLIPS. 

In summary,  Fig. 6  demonstrates frame -by -frame 3D reconstruction with ECLIPS during an 

in situ redox process. On one hand, the reconstructed sequence tracks the temporal evolution 

of two topological structure types —spiral dislocations and steps/terraces —within a unified 

coo rdinate system. On the other hand, the line -profile geometry is consistent with facet and 

dihedral -angle constraints from the Cu 2O Wulff construction, providing crystallography -

based physical validation and supporting the use of these rec onstructions for extracting 

kinetic parameters and enabling mechanistic analysis. 

Conclusion and outlook 

In this work, we have bridged the historical divide between rigorous physical modeling 

and data -driven inference to establish a  unified framework  for quantitative nanometrology. 

By embedding the fundamental laws of electron optics directly into the gradient flow of 

deep neural networks, we convert the ill -posed inverse problem of 3D SEM reconstruction 

into a deterministic and tractable optimization task, enabling metrological, nan oscale  3D topography to be recovered from a single acquisition. Quantitatively, the achieved 

reconstruction resolution reaches 1.1 nm, indicating that the method is nearing the 

hardware -limited regime under  the  SEM settings. 

The development of the VFT and the integration of PINN proved that physical priors —

when formulated as differentiable operators —can effectively govern the behavior of "black 

box" models, ensuring that computational efficiency does not come at the cost of sc ientific 

confidence. 

The implications of this framework extend far beyond static topographic mapping. The 

realization of 4D 

in situ  tracking offers a transformative tool for materials science, allowing 

researchers to quantitatively observe and measure non -equilibrium dynamics —such as 

defect migration, phase transitions, and surface reactions —in real -time and real -space. This 

capabilit y to visualize "the invisible" dynamics of defects like screw dislocations provides the 

missing link between microscopic mechanisms and macroscopi c material performance. 

Motivated by this  technical strategy , ECLIPS  suggests a broad horizon of opportunities. 

First, the framework is naturally extensible to other scattering -based imaging modalities, 

such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X -ray tomography, or optical scattering, 

where complex wave -matter intera ctions similarly hinder quantitative inversion. Second, 

future iterations could incorporate quantum mechanical scattering potentials into the 

forward model, potentially pushing reconstruction precision toward the  atomic scale.
