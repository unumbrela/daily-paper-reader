Abstract 

The integration of large language models (LLMs) into materials science offers a trans-formative opportunity to streamline computational workflows, yet current agentic systems remain constrained by rigid tool-calling approaches and narrowly scoped agents. In this work, we introduce QUASAR, a universal autonomous system for atomistic simulation de-signed to facilitate production-grade scientific discovery. QUASAR autonomously orches-trates complex multi-scale workflows across diverse methods, including density functional theory, machine learning potentials, molecular dynamics, and Monte Carlo simulations. The system incorporates robust mechanisms for adaptive planning, context-efficient mem-ory management, and hybrid knowledge retrieval to navigate real-world research scenarios without human intervention. We benchmark QUASAR against a series of three-tiered tasks, progressing from routine tasks to frontier research challenges such as photocatalyst screen-ing and novel material assessment. These results suggest that QUASAR can function as a general atomistic reasoning system rather than a task-specific automation framework. They also provide initial evidence supporting the potential deployment of agentic AI as a component of computational chemistry research workflows, while identifying areas requiring further development. 

# 1 Introduction 

The rapid advancement of agentic capabilities in large language models (LLMs) presents a compelling opportunity to transform computational chemistry for materials science research [1]. As a discipline fundamentally driven by complex computer-mediated workflows, computational chemistry tasks are naturally suited for integration with LLM-based automation, which can streamline tasks such as simulation setup, data interpretation, and error handling. This approach reduces both cognitive load and the technical burden associated with specialized software stacks and continuous human oversight. More importantly, it can serve as a low-risk, high-fidelity testing ground for systems that manage self-driving labs [2, 3]. Recent research demonstrates the effective integration of LLMs across multiple stages of computational chemistry pipelines. For example, Wang et al. developed DREAMS, a hierar-chical multi-agent framework for density functional theory (DFT) materials simulations that combines a central LLM planner with domain-specific agents for atomistic structure generation, systematic convergence testing, HPC scheduling, and error handling [4]. Similarly, Zou et al.

introduced El Agente Q that dynamically generates, executes, and debugs quantum chemistry workflows from natural language prompts, integrating tools like RDKit, xTB, and ORCA for tasks such as geometry optimization and property prediction [5]. Additionally, Vriza et al. pre-sented a framework for end-to-end atomistic simulations, using LLMs and specialized agents to automate processes from structure generation via Atomsk and interatomic potential discovery, to MD execution with LAMMPS and analysis using OVITO and Phonopy [6]. Several other frameworks have explored similar methods, highlighting the rapidly expanding ecosystem of intelligent, tool-augmented simulation platforms [7, 8, 9, 10]. Yet, most computational chemistry agentic systems remain constrained by rigid tool-calling paradigms and overly fine-grained agent role decompositions, which force models to operate within narrowly predefined functions and workflows. These design choices inherently limit the capacity of LLMs to navigate complex scenarios and engage in self-correction, effectively reduc-ing reasoning engines to mere instruction followers. As a result, these systems struggle with tasks outside the curated demonstrations. Moreover, the extensive implementation of domain-specific tool calls introduces contextual overhead. These highly specialized agents increase system com-plexity and can lead to fragile operations, particularly in basic routing, coordination, and control logic. Together, these factors impose substantial engineering burdens, requiring careful manual design, continuous maintenance, and extensive human effort to stabilize and streamline agent workflows. This complexity ultimately undermines scalability, reliability, and adaptability, im-peding the deployment of agentic systems in real-world computational chemistry settings. In this work, we introduce QUASAR, a production-level universal atomistic computation system designed to overcome these limitations (Table 1). By combining a robust and modular architecture with simulation-optimized mechanisms, QUASAR enables seamless coordination across diverse computational workflows, ranging from quantum mechanical calculations to clas-sical molecular simulations. Unlike conventional systems, which often require extensive manual setup or specialized expertise, QUASAR leverages the knowledge representation and reasoning capabilities of LLMs to automate complex decision-making processes, such as selecting optimal simulation parameters and dynamically adjusting computational strategies. This integration not only enhances usability, allowing researchers to interact with atomistic simulations more intu-itively, but also improves flexibility, supporting a wide range of simulation tools and research objectives. By orchestrating LLM-driven reasoning with high-performance computational rou-tines, QUASAR empowers autonomous scientific research, enabling rapid hypothesis testing, efficient exploration of chemical space, and reliable generation of predictive insights that are traditionally time- and expertise-intensive.

22 System Architecture and Methods 

As shown in Figure 1, QUASAR employs a three-agent architecture built upon LangChain [11]. The Strategist interprets user-defined research objectives and decomposes them into scientif-ically grounded subtasks; the Operator executes these subtasks by interfacing with atomistic simulation software, the local file system, and external resources, handling input preparation, job execution, and analysis; and the Evaluator assesses task completion, returning unsatisfactory results to the Operator for autonomous refinement. 

Figure 1: Overview of the QUASAR architecture, where dashed lines represent optional feedback paths for iterative refinement. The software stack currently included in QUASAR bridges multiple levels of theory using only open-source software. This includes Quantum ESPRESSO [12] for ab initio DFT calcula-tions, MACE [13] for machine-learned potentials (MLP), LAMMPS [14] for classical molecular dynamics (MD), and RASPA3 [15] for grand canonical Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, unified through ASE [16] and pymatgen [17] for structure manipulation and analysis. The multiscale integration allows QUASAR to autonomously chain simulations across length and time scales. As one example, the system can parameterize force fields from quantum calculations and then deploy the resulting force field for large-scale dynamics or adsorption studies that would be intractable at the DFT level. In addition to the predefined computational pillars, QUASAR is designed to support dynamic tool integration. As summarized in Table 1, many existing agentic systems rely on hard-coded agent hierarchies and tightly scoped domain-specific tools, which can make their architectures rigid and difficult to extend. Adding new tools to these systems often requires major architecture re-engineering, introducing new specialized agents and functions. QUASAR significantly lowers the barrier to extensibility. For immediate requirements, users can trigger tool installation directly via natural-language prompts. For stable, long-term solutions, developers can bundle tools into the Docker environment with minimal prompt updates. Both pathways significantly reduce integration costs and reinforce the flexibility-oriented design of QUASAR. 

2.1 Robust and Adaptive Planning 

Planning is the most critical stage of the system, as it explicitly defines the Operator’s scope of action and establishes the core principles guiding execution. For complex computational chem-3istry objectives, the direct plan from the Strategist may occasionally overlook key considerations or domain-specific cues. This plan can in turn lead the Operator toward suboptimal or inap-propriate actions. For example, in a multi-stage free energy or adsorption workflow, a plan may omit prerequisite equilibration steps which can potentially lead to physically inconsistent or un-reliable results. Therefore, to maintain high-quality plan generation, we adopted a double-pass planning mechanism: an initial plan produced by the Strategist is subjected to a second-pass review that explicitly checks missing elements before execution. QUASAR also incorporates an iterative feedback loop with optional human-in-the-loop (HITL) integration to address scenarios where “one-shot” generation falls short of the scientific objective. After a completed run, researchers may either trigger an automated improvement cycle or provide specific insights. This prompts the Strategist to shift from a generative role to a diagnostic one, critically analyzing the previous outputs to propose targeted improvements or corrections. To further align planning with diverse research objectives, the Strategist is regulated by two user-adjustable parameters: Granularity and Accuracy. Granularity controls task decomposi-tion depth (number of tasks), determining how frequently evaluation and context compression occur. Finer granularity enables more frequent checkpoints but may introduce unnecessary fragmentation for straightforward tasks, while coarser granularity reduces overhead for simpler workflows. Accuracy balances computational cost against precision: “eco” mode employs compu-tationally efficient methods for rapid screening, whereas “pro” mode applies rigorous approaches for high-accuracy results at the expense of increased computation time. These parameters en-able QUASAR to dynamically adapt its planning and memory architecture to specific research needs. Straightforward tasks such as variable-cell (VC) relaxation in Quantum ESPRESSO ben-efit from low granularity settings, avoiding redundant task fragmentation and evaluations that would otherwise degrade execution efficiency. This flexibility allows researchers to optimize the balance between thoroughness and computational economy based on their specific objectives. 

2.2 Context and Memory Efficiency 

Tuning context is one of the major challenges in agentic design as it governs the quality and stability of agent orchestration [18]. Much like human collaboration, the clarity and volume of the information passed between agents directly dictate the effectiveness of the collective outcome. While recent LLMs feature significantly expanded context windows, they are not infinite. More importantly, analogous to human cognition, as the context length expands, the likelihood of losing focus on the previous conversation increases [19]. For instance, as the Operator progresses through a list of tasks, the accumulating context can become excessively large, effectively diluting the model’s understanding of completed tasks and escalating the API costs. To mitigate this, our system optimizes context sharing at two levels: between individual tasks (task-task) and across distinct execution sessions (run-run). Once the Evaluator verifies the successful completion of a task, it condenses the task context by distilling the valuable actions and outcomes while discarding noise and failed attempts. This not only reduces the overall context length but also strengthens contextual coherence. To support the replanning mechanism discussed earlier, the system additionally maintains long-term memory across runs. In contrast to task-level compression, upon completion of a run the system saves a task-level summary produced by the Evaluator, together with a complete summary generated by the Operator at the final step, to the local filesystem in Markdown format. Enabling seamless connection to prior execution context, QUASAR provides an incremental workflow that drives continuous improvement, and also provides an accessible entry point for human review. 4Figure 2: A three-stage pipeline illustrating how the Operator coordinates end-to-end simulation tasks. 

2.3 Long Simulation Handling 

The system is designed for reliable operation in real-world scenarios where interruptions from API exhaustion, wall-time limits, or unexpected shutdowns are common. To address this, we implemented persistent state management, ensuring that the full agent state (conversation his-tory and completed steps) is automatically checkpointed after every execution. This allows the system to recover from interruptions without any loss of progress. In addition to the generic checkpointing, QUASAR is specifically optimized for recovering interrupted simulations. When an interrupted simulation is resumed, the system auto-injects an interruption-awareness prompt that guides the Operator to restart from the most recent intermediate state rather than restarting the workflow. For example, during a VC relaxation with Quantum ESPRESSO, the Operator agent will attempt to resume the calculation from the partially relaxed structure instead of initiating a fresh run, significantly reducing redundant computation. The successful execution and completion of a simulation does not necessarily guarantee scientific correctness or numerical precision. For instance, in software like Quantum ESPRESSO, if a convergence threshold is set too strictly or the system is unstable, the program may reach its default maximum step limit (e.g., 100 steps) and exit without achieving convergence. While the job appears “Done” in the output, the simulation has not been completed. In long-duration or computationally expensive simulations, these “silent failures” lead to significant waste of time and resources. To address this, we introduce a check-in mechanism that allows users to configure the inspection frequency for the Operator (default: 15 minutes). At each check-in, the Operator evaluates intermediate outputs to assess whether the simulation is progressing correctly. If clear issues are detected, such as a lack of DFT convergence, the Operator terminates the run and attempts to reconstruct or optimize the input parameters or other related factors. 

2.4 Hybrid Knowledge Retrieval 

QUASAR employs a domain-specific Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) database, index-ing documentation and source code to mitigate hallucinations arising from limited or outdated LLM knowledge. However, simulation engines such as LAMMPS and Quantum ESPRESSO rely on highly specialized and unique input syntaxes. Their official example scripts and input files typically contain very minor natural language comments and instead rely on a separate overview README file for explanation. This sparse semantic context makes embedding-based retrieval challenging, as the technical syntax and domain-specific parameters lack the descriptive text that vector search relies upon. To overcome this limitation, QUASAR exposes a local repository 5of example input files directly to the Operator. Rather than relying solely on semantic embed-dings, the Operator leverages its reasoning capabilities to navigate to the provided directories, interpret filenames, and parse README files to identify relevant reference examples. Additionally, QUASAR implements a hierarchical knowledge-access protocol via the Oper-ator’s system prompt to further enhance the retrieval efficiency. When the Operator has high confidence in the required simulation physics and input syntax, it proceeds autonomously using its internal knowledge. If uncertainty arises, it is guided to first perform semantic similar-ity matching via RAG to relevant documentation or code examples. When a RAG query is insufficient or ambiguous, the system uses the logical inference approach, in which the Opera-tor systematically explores the provided example repositories and infers appropriate simulation patterns. Only as a final fallback does the Operator expand its search space to external web resources. By escalating from quick-access internal data to resource-heavy external searches only when necessary, QUASAR allows the system to reliably support complex simulation setups and debugging tasks, ensuring higher rates of successful simulation execution while reducing unnecessary action overhead. 

2.5 Containerized Environment and HPC Optimization 

Usability and security are two critical considerations in the design of QUASAR. To ensure seamless deployment across diverse environments, QUASAR provides cross-platform Docker containers pre-packaged with the suite of computational tools stated previously. This includes specialized images optimized for CUDA and ROCm to facilitate hardware-accelerated inference (e.g., for MACE models). Moreover, from a security perspective, the containerized nature inher-ently prevents catastrophic actions such as deletion of system files. QUASAR can also operate completely offline and supports integration with locally hosted open-source LLMs, ensuring that sensitive or confidential data remains secure. QUASAR is deeply optimized for high-performance computing (HPC), and its Docker con-tainers are designed to run natively under Singularity/Apptainer on HPC systems. Its non-interactive execution mode paired with a built-in restart mechanism, allows entire workflows to be submitted and reliably executed as standard batch jobs. The system currently does not support agent-driven HPC job submission, as it is designed to prioritize broad compatibility across diverse computational environments. The variations in HPC schedulers, configurations, and site-specific policies make it difficult to reliably abstract them into a single generalized interface. Therefore, for specialized deployments targeting a single fixed HPC environment, additional facility-specific submission tooling could be incorporated, but this falls outside the current design scope of QUASAR. 

2.6 User Interfaces 

To connect the system backend with end users, QUASAR provides a Command Line Interface (CLI) with essential control and monitoring capabilities. The CLI permits real-time tracking of agent progress and provides granular visibility into execution details, including the generated plan and code snippets. It also supports a robust restart mechanism, allowing users to resume execution after interruptions. For advanced use cases, an optional web-based graphical user interface (GUI) is available through licensing agreements, offering streamlined monitoring, fine-grained execution control, and visualization.

3.1 Tier I. Task Execution 

To verify the baseline usability of the system, we selected three simple representative tasks spanning distinct methodological archetypes. These foundational tests are designed to confirm that QUASAR can reliably execute well-defined, single-step calculations that form the building blocks of more complex workflows. While individually straightforward, each task requires correct parameter selection, appropriate software invocation, and accurate interpretation of outputs. The first task involves DFT k-point convergence, which ensures reliable Brillouin-zone sam-pling for electronic structure simulations and is a prerequisite for any production-quality peri-odic calculation. The second task addresses N P T ensemble equilibration in molecular dynamics, which is essential for obtaining thermodynamically consistent densities before production sim-ulations and validates the capacity of QUASAR to configure and monitor classical simulation 7protocols. The third task focuses on helium void-fraction analysis, a Monte Carlo characteriza-tion method used to quantify accessible porosity in porous materials for gas storage and sepa-ration applications. Together, these three tasks span quantum mechanical, classical mechanics, and Monte Carlo methods, providing a representative cross-section of the computational toolkit commonly employed in materials science research. 

3.2 Tier II. Workflow Orchestration 

Moving beyond individual calculations, Tier II evaluates the ability of QUASAR to decompose high-level scientific questions into coherent, multi-step computational workflows. The first task involves calculating the electronic band gap of bulk nickel oxide, which chal-lenges the system to handle strongly correlated transition metal oxides. This requires optimizing the crystal structure, correctly initializing the Type-II antiferromagnetic ordering, and applying an appropriate Hubbard U correction (DFT+ U ) or hybrid functional to accurately reproduce the band gap. The second task focuses on generating CO 2 adsorption isotherms for UiO-66 at 298 K. To produce a full isotherm, the system must orchestrate a series of Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations, which involves selecting appropriate force fields, preparing the simulation cell, and systematically sweeping through a range of chemical potentials (pressures) to map the isotherm. The final task in this tier requires determining the melting point of aluminum, testing the ability of QUASAR to characterize phase transitions using molecular dynamics methods. The agent must autonomously infer and correctly sequence all prerequisite computational steps, such as system equilibration and phase initialization prior to executing the melting-point calculation. It then needs to select a reliable approach such as the two-phase coexistence method or temper-ature curves to accurately reproduce the solid–liquid transition temperature. 

3.3 Tier III. Frontier Research 

While the Tier II tasks demonstrate strong potential for real-world applications, they are well-documented in the literature and possibly represented in LLM training data. Tier III therefore targets recent or open research problems that lack established protocols, thereby testing the ability of the system to reason and explore without bias. We tasked QUASAR with screening 5% La-doped ATaO 3 perovskites (A = Li, Na, K) for the photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange under UV irradiation. This complex query requires the agent to compute and align band edges relative to relevant redox potentials, assess the impact of doping on the optical gap, and evaluate defect formation energies. This task is based on recent published work from our lab [24]. The system was further challenged to identify which candidate covalent organic framework (COF) maximizes selectivity for xenon over krypton (Xe/Kr) at 298 K, from a selection of two unpublished COF structures. Research currently under review features these structures and they were experimentally verified. This task demands a comparative screening workflow that captures subtle host–guest interactions distinguishing these two noble gases, necessitating precise force-field selection and competitive adsorption simulations. Finally, we provided the system with a novel material structure generated via latent diffusion that is not yet experimentally synthesized [25]. We tasked the agent with simulating its mechan-ical properties and CO 2 adsorption capacity. This stress test evaluates robustness in handling potentially unstable or unoptimized geometries, requiring structural integrity validation (e.g., via elastic tensor calculations) before proceeding to functional property prediction. 84 Discussion 

The performance of QUASAR in Tier I and Tier II highlighted both the strengths and limi-tations of reasoning-driven computation. The system achieved accurate results with efficiency and rigor across all cases in these tiers, except for the Tier II NiO band gap calculation. In that case, the system failed to obtain an accurate value for the first run and required two further auto-improvement run contexts to recognize the need to switch to the higher-fidelity Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE) method. This behavior likely reflects the strong training priors of the LLM, as DFT+ U is overwhelmingly reported as the default approach for NiO in the literature. However, with the auto-improvement mechanism, QUASAR was able to escape this “local optimum” and progress toward a more accurate solution, illustrating the value of iterative, incremental approaches to goal-directed computation and highlighting the role of HITL guidance (i.e. signaling an auto-improvement loop) in achieving robust results. Building upon this foundation, it underscores the importance of Tier III testing, which evaluates not only the robustness of trained routines but also the capacity for LLM to apply its learned knowledge in novel scenarios. In this tier, the final photocatalyst screening results correctly recreated the published result [24], and the gas separation and virtual MOF cases are validated as physically reasonable and methodologically reliable (see Supporting Information). Importantly, the performance of QUASAR in Tier III challenges the conventional assumption that materials research requires HITL guidance. These tasks did not undergo auto-improvement and the system performed end-to-end screening, method selection, and analysis, suggesting that agentic AI systems can independently execute complex scientific workflows with minimal or no human intervention. Our results highlight that QUASAR, and similar systems, may exhibit a level of autonomy that approaches that of expert researchers, while the boundaries of this capability remain to be fully determined. Ultimately, these findings indicate that QUASAR is not merely an automation layer over existing simulation tools, but a fundamentally different paradigm for conducting atomistic re-search. Rather than encoding fixed workflows or predefined procedural pipelines, QUASAR demonstrates reasoning-driven orchestration, where planning, execution, evaluation, and refine-ment emerge from coordinated agent cognition. This shift is critical: the system does not depend on hard-coded domain logic, but instead exhibits generalizable scientific competence across het-erogeneous tasks, methods, and research contexts. The ability of a single architecture and control logic to operate effectively across all three tiers indicates that QUASAR appears to cap-ture transferable structure in scientific problem-solving. This suggests that QUASAR exhibits flexibility across the tested task types, though generalization beyond the evaluated benchmark suite requires further investigation. The reliance of this system on LLM capabilities means per-formance is bounded by the underlying domain knowledge and in-context learning ability of the chosen model. Additionally, QUASAR achieved correct and high-quality results across all three benchmark tiers using a lightweight model gemini-3-flash-preview . This suggests that frontier models, such as gemini-3-pro-preview with enhanced reasoning capabilities, may not only pass the proposed benchmarks but do so with greater efficiency and rigor. The API costs when using 

gemini-3-flash-preview are also cost-effective: approximately $1 USD for Tier I (single-step) and $10 USD for Tier II test cases. Although Tier III scenarios incur higher costs ranging from $10 USD to $30 USD, these remain manageable given the complexity of the tasks and the cost can be further reduced by employing context caching to avoid redundant token processing [26]. 

# 5 Summary and Outlook 

In this work, we introduced QUASAR, an open-source, portable, and universal atomistic com-putation system designed to transition agentic AI from simple demonstrations and basic task 9handling toward production-grade scientific discovery. The flexible architecture of QUASAR supports further customization with minimal effort, such as the seamless integration of addi-tional tools. Through our Tier III benchmarking, QUASAR demonstrates that LLMs, when properly orchestrated, are capable of executing sophisticated computational chemistry tasks with a level of scientific rigor comparable to that of human researchers. This work serves as a proof of concept that modern AI has the potential to automate the vast majority of standard computational workloads, freeing the scientific process from the bottlenecks of manual execution. This positions QUASAR as a prototype for human–AI collaborative workflows in computational chemistry, where AI handles routine orchestration while humans provide scientific direction, judgment on ambiguous cases, and validation of results. Beyond the gemini-3-flash-preview evaluated in this study, a diverse array of frontier LLMs, along with specialized small-scale models tailored for computational chemistry tasks, continue to emerge [27]. Given this diversity, selecting the best-performance model remains challenging when relying solely on success rates. It is imperative that future directions focus on developing comprehensive benchmarks (beyond the limited set employed in this study) to evaluate not only whether scientific objectives are achieved, but also the broader capabilities underlying the success. These benchmarks are necessary to fairly test the strategies employed, and the efficiency of decision-making across different models and agentic systems. Our study also offers a perspective on the necessary evolution of the current scientific process as AI capabilities are reaching unprecedented heights. As execution, debugging, and workflow construction become automated, the primary role of human researchers shifts toward conceptual framing and theoretical innovation. This transition does not displace scientists but reallocates cognitive responsibility, enabling human researchers to prioritize scientific scope and hypotheses. We envision that AI may fundamentally reshape the structure and dynamics of the research lifecycle in the near future.
