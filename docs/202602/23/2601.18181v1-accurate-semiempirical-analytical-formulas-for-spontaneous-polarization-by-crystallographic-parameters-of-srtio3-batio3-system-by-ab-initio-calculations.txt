Spontaneous polarization s (PS’s) of BaTiO 3 and Sr TiO 3 under various conditions are calculated ab 

initio using different exchange -correlation functionals . The extensive theoretical set s of PS vs. ion position s

are found to lie on a single curve , despite the chemical differences and the wide var iations of PS and lattice 

parameters . This uncover s accurate simple analytical formula s of PS of Sr TiO 3-BaTiO 3 system express ed by 

ion position s; a single formula predicts both macroscopic and atomic -scale PS of Sr TiO 3, BaTiO 3 and 

Sr TiO 3-BaTiO alloys. The accuracy of the formula is demo nstrated by the application to experiments, 

BaTiO 3-Sr TiO 3 (-Ca TiO 3) alloy s, Sr 4Ti 4O12 with PS // a-axis, a parallel domain, and a headon domain. In 

addition, t he present results verify empirically that oxygen displacement is the primary identifier and the 

origin of PS of Sr TiO 3 and BaTiO 3 and indicate that Ba TiO 3 and S rTiO 3 may transforms into new state by an 

extremely large strain, e.g.,  -3%. Furthermore, the earlier prediction of headon domain without aid of defects 

was confirmed. The present procedure s for finding formulas can be applied to other materials .

1. Introduction 

Electrically reversible s pontaneous polarization PS is th e principal property of f erroelectric s [1] . PS

depends on chemical composition , lattice para mete rs, growth processes, and ambient conditions such as 

temperature and strain. Although PS is estimated by polarization loop measurements or pyroelectric current 

[1] , these measurements cannot work occasionally because of high conductance, strong pinning , or small 

size s. In such cases, crystallographic estimation of PS can be useful and effective for ultrahigh speed 

measurements of PS. Moreover , t he value of PS varies within a given material due to domains, surface, 

interface with other materials, electric field, and strain. In these cases , the estimation of local PS or atomic 

scale PS, is essential for the understanding ferroelectric properties . Such measurements are frequently 

performed through the identifications of ion pos ition s by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) [2].

The ferroelectricity of ABO 3–type perovskite oxides (A: A-site ion, B: B-site ion, O: oxygen) are 

conventionally explain ed by displacement of ions from the positions of a centrosymmetric structure (Fig. 1) ,

where the displacement patterns are described by Slater [3] , Last [4] and Axe mode [5]. These displacements 

in B aTiO 3 are consider ed to occur in a cage formed by Ba ions [6], which suggest s that the ferroelectricity 

can be described by the displacem ents of Ti and O ions. Consequently , the position of B -site ion such as Ti 

and Zr is used to represent local PS [7]. On the other hand , Bilz et al. [8] have successfully explained the 

ferroelectricity by O-ion displacements. 

Indeed, we found that the plot of PS vs. the distance between Ti and O ion of BaTiO 3 under various 

strains calculated with several exchange -correlation (XC) functionals lay precisely on a single curve, despite 

widely varying PS [9]. The present paper reveal s that all the sets of PS and certain ion positions of 

prototypical ferroelectrics BaTiO 3 and SrTiO 3 lie precisely o n a single curve, despite chemical difference, 

structur al difference, and widely varying PS. This is probably due to the similarity between BaTiO 3 and 

SrTiO 3 that the bonding between A -site ion and Ti is weak [6] .

The variations of PS we re mostly due to some ion position s. Therefore, these plots uncover analytical 

expressions of PS by ion position s, e.g., given by experiments , of which validity is confirmed in Sec. 4 .

These examinations show also that the oxygen position is more appropriate than the Ti position as an 

identifier of PS consistently with Bilz et al. [8], which is more evident in SrTiO 3 than in BaTiO 3. The present 3

paper shows also the distance between Ti and O as the primary order parameter .

2. Computational method 

Under stress -free condition , BaTiO 3 is tetragonal (C4v 1) at room temperature (RT) (Table 1 and F ig. 

1(a)) . RT -phase and low -temperature (low -T) phase SrTiO 3 under stress -free condition are cubic (Oh1) and 

tetragonal (D4h 18 ), respectively [10 , 11 ]. The RT -phase SrTiO 3 can be referred to SrTiO 3 with the 

antiferro -distortive (AFD) rotation angle ( 

)

= 0. 

As for ferroelectric distortions, small uniform displacements of ions // c-axis , i.e., 

Slater -mode -like -displacements // c-axis , are applied as an initial perturbation for PS except for the 

calculations in Sec. 4 (Table 2) . Consequently, all these phase s are tetragonal under biaxial inplane -stress 

(Table 1) .

The unit -cell of low -T, i.e., 105K phase SrTiO 3 consists of 20 atoms [10 ] (Table 1) , but t he results of 

low -T phase SrTiO 3 are presented in pseudo cubic unit cell [11 ] (Fig. 1 (b) ). That is, all the results are 

presented for 5-atom unit cell, and PS // c-axis except for two data in S ec. 4 . The suffix “pc ” stands for 

pseudo cubic unit cell . For example, we use [100] pc for the a-axis of pseudo cubic unitcell .

The XC functionals [12 -19] used in the present calculations are listed in Table 3 . Although the XC 

functional s used for each data point are shown in legends of F igs. 3 -6, the distinction of the XC functionals is 

unnecess ary in the present work . In HSE (HSE06) [18 ], screening length 

 was the default value (0.2 Å-1) [16 ,

17 ]. TPSS + U agreed best with experiments of stress -free BaTiO 3 among the examined density functional +U

approaches [9]. Here , both Liechtenstein [19 ] and Dudarev [20 ] schemes for TPSS +U without exchange term 

(J = 0) yielded mutually similar results . Therefore, the present paper reports the results with Liechtenstein 

scheme with J = 0 [9].

All calculations were performed using the project or augmented wave (PAW) method [21 ] as 

implemented in the Vienna ab -initio simulation package (Vasp ) [22 ] with a plane wave energy cutoff of 650 

eV. PAW potential s we re chosen from those supplied by Vasp , so that the calculat ion s with each XC 

functional agree d best with stress -free BaTiO 3. For th e Brillouin -zone integration, Monkhorst -Pack mesh es 

[23 ] of 6×6×6 and  6×6×4 were  used in  geometry  relaxation and Berry phase calculation  [24 ] of  PS for 5 4

and 20 atom unit cell , respectively . In the calculations in Sec. 4 , Monkhorst -Pack mesh es [23 ] of 8×8×4, 6

×6×2, and 2 ×6×6 were  used  for BaSrTiO 2O6, a headon -domain, and a parallel domain, respectively.  In 

the calculations of  biaxially strained  cases , geometry  wa s fully relaxed under the  constrain t of fixed  value s of 

the  a-axis lattice constant.  After the  geometry  relaxation s, all  the calculated forces  we re always less than 

0.001 eV/ Å, except for  the calculations of domains in Sec. 4 where  a few atoms in the middle of each domain 

were fixed . The se  results  were the same for denser mesh and more strict criteria of  calculated forces.  The 

effects of different PAW potentials and the screeni ng length of HSE and HSEsol were much smaller than  the 

difference of XC functionals.  The consistency and accuracy of the present  calculations were reported  [9, 25 ].

The external strain uext for each p hase is defined by uext  a  a0/a 0 where the theoretical a-axis 

lattice constant a0 of the stress -free minimum -free -energy structure of each phase is calculated with each XC 

functional. The results below are for -0.02  uext  0 except for low -T phase SrTiO 3 and PBEsol calculations 

[9]: In the PBEsol calculations of BaTiO 3 and RT -phase Sr TiO 3, -0.04  uext  0, while -0.01  uext  0 for 

low -T phase SrTiO 3. The 

 dependence of low -T phase SrTiO 3 was calculat ed by PBEsol for 0o 

  8o [25 ]

in Sec. 3 . The illustrations of la ttices and electron densitie s are drawn by VESTA [26 ]. Figure 1(a) shows the 

ion positions, where O1 and O2 stands for the oxygen ions in BaO (SrO) and TiO 2 plane, respectively. 

3. Crystallographic estimation of PS

3.1 Empirical formula of PS from ab initio results 

The electronic ground state of a given ferroelectric is calculable, when the positions of all the nuclei are 

determined , because the ground state electron density 

 is calculable from these positions (Fig.2) . Therefore , PS

at the ground state , which is due to the non -centrosymmetric electron and ion distribution , is calculable , when the 

positions of all the nuclei are known .

From now, we focus on the periodic systems, i.e., infinite single crystals. In these cases, the positions of all 

the nuclei in a unitcell are sufficient for the preceding conclusions. Therefore, “ion positions ” below means “all 

the ion positions in a unitcell ” of a given ferroelectric material . According to the preceding conclusions, when 

both of the electro n density 

 calculated for given ion positions and the calculation of polarization [24 ] are exact ,

PS should be a well -defined single -valued function of ion positions f: PS = f (ion positions). 5

Indeed, we can assume that the calculations of both 

 and the polarization are accurate , because PS

calculated with all the XC functionals using experimental ion positions an d lattice constants at 303K [27 ] agreed 

with the experimental PS at 298 K (exp.: 0.2 5 C/m 2 [28 ]) [9]. In addition, PS by different XC functi onals was 

virtually the same when the crystallographic parameters were the same for all the calculations [9], although PS

varied with crystallographic parameter s and XC functionals (Figs. 2 and 3). Therefore , the wide variations of the 

ab initio 

 and PS in Fig s. 2 and 3 are considered predominantly due to the difference in the estimation of the ion 

positions. 

The next question is “how to find the function f or the most effective ion positions for PS.

Exemplarily in Fig. 3 , each XC functional tends to yield specific deviations of c rystallographic properties 

from ideal experimental ones, because it underestimate s or overestimates some interactions depending on the 

approximations that each XC functional uses. Such deviations of ionic positions from ideal positions are 

considered to occur also locally in experiments owing to ambient temperature, defects and local strains. 

Therefore, the ab initio P S deviating fro m ideal experiments can be reinterpreted as exact calculations of P S

of the lattice deviating from ideal ones . That is, we regard that all the ab initio PS’s in the present 

calculations correspond exactly to some experimental situations or all the theoreti cal data in Figs. 3 - 6

represent some experiments .

In other words , the correlations between theoretical PS and theoretical c rystallographic properties 

correspond to those in experiments. Therefore, these correlations are used to identify the primary 

crystallographic property responsible for PS that can be used for c rystallographic identifications of PS in 

experiments. 

Consequently , the fitting to the data in each figure yields a s emiempirical analytical formula f for PS

express ed by crystallographic p arameters . If the selected crystallographic parameter represent s the ion 

positions essential and necessary for P S, all the data of P S vs. of this parameter should be on a single curve. 

These arguments show that formulas of PS express ed by crystallographic parameter s (f’s) exist f or a given 

ferroelectric material. 

Furthermore, i n both SrTiO 3 and BaTiO 3, PS is expected to be a function of Ti, O1 and O2 positions 

(Fig. 1(a) ), because the contributio n of Ba is shown to be small [6] and that of Sr is probably also small. 6

Therefore, an analytical formula f that works for both SrTiO 3 and BaTiO 3 may exist. Indeed, Fig. 6 show s

that a single formula applicable for SrTiO 3 and BaTiO 3 exist s, although it was unexpected .

3.2 Over view of results in Sec. 3

Section 3 present s the following results .

● Figure 2 illustrate s how polar charge distributions appear and grow and how the difference between BaTiO 3

and SrTiO 3 originates. 

● Figure 3 shows strain -dependence of PS and ion positions, which suggests the primary ions responsible for 

PS. In addition, Fig. 3 demonstrates exemplarily wide variations of PS and ion positions due to XC functionals .

● Figure 4 examines conventionally accepted crystallographic parameters for PS. These parameters are used 

frequently , because they are obtained by basic experiments. 

● Figure 5 examines the representations of PS by the position of a single ion , where Ti position is mostly used 

currently. 

● Figure 6 examines the positions of multiple ions for the representation of PS.

In Figs. 3 -6, the legends and c aptions explain XC function al s, e.g., PBEsol, and “_LT ” in Figs. 4-6 show s

a result for lo w-T phase SrTiO 3. H owever, they can be completely ignored for the understanding of the prim ary 

crystal lographic parameters, while the results for BaTiO 3 and those for SrTiO 3 should be distinguished. 

3.3 Dependence of PS on crystallographic parameters 

The electron densit y distribution 

 in F ig. 2 shows that Ti -O distance change s with |uext | in both 

BaTiO 3 and RT -phase SrTiO 3, which explains the origin of the increase of PS. These displacements change 

chemical bonding between ions, which was evident for | uext | > 0.03 as seen in F igs. 2(c), 2(f), 2(i) and 2 (l). In 

particular, Ti -O2, Ti -O1 and Ba (Sr) -O1 bonding (Fig. 1(a)) were evidently fortified for | uext | > 0.03. 

Consequently, the bonding Ba, O1 and Ti are connected by strong bonding, and th e charge distribution 

around Ti changes fro m spheres to pancakes as s ee n in the [110] planes (Figs. 2(f ) and 2 (l )). 

Despite the clear difference in 

 at  uext = 0 (Figs. 2(a), 2(d), 2(g) and 2(j)) ,

 of BaTiO 3 and RT -phase 7

SrTiO 3 are mutually similar at these large strain (Figs. 2(c), 2(f), 2(i) and 2(l) ). This is consistent with PS and 

zTi -O2 of RT -phase SrTiO 3 similar to those of BaTiO 3 in F ig. 6(a). In addition, 

 of  BaTiO 3 at uext = 0 

resembles 

 of  RT -phase SrTiO 3 at uext = -0.01 (Figs 2(a) and 2(h)), which is consistent with PS of RT -phase 

SrTiO 3 at uext = -0.01 similar to PS of BaTiO 3 at uext = 0 in Fig. 3(a)) and ref. [9] (both by PBEso l) . How ever, 

the difference between BaTiO 3 and SrTiO 3 still exists at low 

’s in Figs. 2(d) and 2(k). 

In Fig. 3(a) , the PS - uext curves of RT -phase SrTiO 3 exhibit wide variations depending on XC functional .

The displacements of Ti, O1 and O2 atom from cubic positions along c-axis of pseudo -cubic 5 -atom unit cell in 

fractions of the c lattice constant ~ 4 Å are denoted by 

zTi ,

zO1 , and 

zO2 , respectively (Table 2 ), and 

zTi -O2 =

zTi 

zO2 and 

zTi -O1 =

zTi 

zO1 . Throughout the present paper, we use the coordinate system in which Ba or 

Sr atom is always fixed at the origin (0, 0, 0) in both paraelectric and ferroelectric phase . For example, the z

coordinate of Ti ion is in paraelectric ( Oh1, P4mmm ) and ferroelectric phase s (C4v 1) are 0.5 and 0.5 + 

zTi ,

respectively (Table 2) .

In Fig. 3 (b), t he ionic displacement s (

zTi ,

zO2 ,

zTi -O2 ) vs. uext curves depend critically on XC 

functionals but correspond excellently to the PS- uext curves of each XC functional. Similar results were 

found for BaTiO 3 [9]. This suggests that the se ion displacements can be good representations for PS.

In agreement with established knowle dge , c/a, c-lattice constant, and 

zTi of BaTiO 3 correlated with PS in 

ref. [9]. In RT - and low -T phase Sr TiO 3, on the contrary , the correlations of PS with c/a, c and 

zTi are ambiguous 

and are scattered by XC functional dependence in Figs. 4 and 5(a) . Therefore, c/a, c-lattice constant , and 

zTi are 

not the primary c rystallographic parameter responsible for PS of Sr TiO 3 (Nonetheless, the c-lattice constant in the 

limited range > 0.392 nm can be used to estimate PS of Sr TiO 3 very approximately). 

In Figs. 5(b) and 5(c), b oth oxygen ion displacements 

zO1 and 

zO2 correlated with PS markedly 

better than 

zTi . In Fig. 5(b), the PS -

zO1 plots of BaTiO 3 and RT - and low -T phase Sr TiO 3 lie mostly on a 

single curve. Especially, the plots of PS -

zO1 of RT - and low -T phase Sr TiO 3 lie on a straight line. In Fig. 

5(c) , the plots of PS -

zO2 of BaTiO 3 lie on a single curve, while the plots of RT - and low -T phase Sr TiO 3 lie 

excellently on another single line . This indicates that 

zO2 is an essential pa rt of the primary c rystallographic 

property for PS and can be used for the estimation of PS.8

In F ig. 6 (a), all the PS -

zTi -O2 plots lie on a single straight line, despite the difference in XC 

functional s, the magnitude of str ain , AFD rotation angle 

, lattice, symmetry, and material . In addition, all 

the PS -

zTi -O1 plots lie al most on a single curve in Fig. 6 (b). Therefore, 

zTi -O2 and 

zTi -O1 are primary 

crystallographic properties for PS. These correlations yield analytical formula s of PS expressed by 

zTi -O2 or 

zTi -O1 , which is summarized in Table 4. Almost the same results as Figs. 5 and 6 we re obtained changing the 

unit of the displacements, e.g., 

zTi -O2 from fraction of c-lattice constant to absolute value ( Å).

As mentioned above , the ground state electron density 

 is determined from the ion positions .

Therefore, even when we claim that PS is determined by the displacement of some ions, the origin of PS is 

still ion and electrons. Under this presumption , the ferroelectricity of Ba TiO 3 and S rTiO 3 is considered as 

oxygen -driven , because PS correlated excellently with 

zO2 and 

zTi -O2 and the main contribution to 

zTi -O2 is 

from 

zO2 . This is mainly due to the value of |

zO2 | and  |zO1 | far larger than 

zTi as seen in F ig. 5 .

The oxygen mechanism is considered more dominant in S rTiO 3 than in Ba TiO 3, because PS

correlated with 

zO2 and 

zO1 better in S rTiO 3 than Ba TiO 3 and correlated with 

zTi worse in S rTiO 3 than 

Ba TiO 3 (Figs. 5(b) and 5 (c)) . In terms of  15  zone -center phonon of cubic lattice , the present displacement 

patterns we re equal to a mixture of Slater, Last and Axe modes [3-5], whe reas the weight of Slater mode wa s

larger in BaTiO 3 than the others , and the weight of each mode wa s nearly the same in the ferroelectricity of 

Sr TiO 3.

In Figs. 5 and 6 , the results for SrTiO 3 and BaTiO 3 at uext = -0.03 and  -0.04, which are shown by small 

filled red circles and small half -filled brown circles, respectively , exhibit the uext -dependence different from 

those for |uext |  0.02. Here, the growth of SrTiO 3 and BaTiO 3 at uext   -0.03  without defects is 

experime ntally diffic ult. Indeed, Fig. 3 (b) suggests that the strain dependence of 

zTi ,

zO2 and ,

zTi -O2 

changes for uext   -0.03 ; f or example, 

zTi decreased with | uext |  0.03  in F ig. 3(b) . In addition, the unit cell 

volume increased with | uext |  0.03, while it decreased with | uext |  0.02. These characteristics were also 

found in BaTiO 3 [9]. Therefore, SrTiO 3 and BaTiO 3 for uext   -0.03  are not included in the fitting. 

4. Validity of the present fo rmula s

Among the formulas obtained in Sec. 3 , the formula s based on 

zTi -O2 and 

zTi -O1 were accur ate , while 9

the formula based on 

zO2 was also accurate when different formulas are used for Sr TiO 3 and Ba TiO 3.

Because t he formulas based on 

zTi -O2 and 

zTi -O1 work for both Sr TiO 3 and Ba TiO 3, the validity of the 

following formu la s (Table 4) are examined with experimental values and ab initio calculations: 

PS (C/ cm2) = 977 zTi -O2 + 0.0 4, (1) 

PS (C/ cm2) = 867 zTi -O1 27 30 zTi -O1+ 0.82 (2) 

Because Eqs. (1) and (2) use 

zTi -O2 and 

zTi -O1, respectively, we define an oxygen position using 

“O* ”: O* in 

zTi -O2 (O*) is an O on a Ti -O bonding perpendicular to the direction of a PS component , and O* 

in 

zTi -O1 is an O on a Ti -O bonding along a PS component . For example, O* of 

zTi -O2 is O2 of Fig. 1 (a) for 

PS // [0 01]pc and O1 of Fig. 1 (a) for PS // [110] pc .

When the unitcell consist s of multiple pseudo cubic cells as in BaSrTi 2O6 and low -T phase SrTiO 3 in 

Fig. 7 , PS is defined as an average of all the pseudo cubic cells . When PS // [001 ]pc (“pc ” stands for pseudo 

cubic ),zTi -O2 = distance between Ti and O* ion ( Å)  c-lattice constant of pseudo cubic 5 -atom cell ( Å).

For simplicity , the c-lattice constant of pseudo cubic cells can be approximated by an average of all the 

pseudo cubic cells : For example, the c-lattice constant of pseudo cubic cells in BaSrTi 2O6 is a half of the 

c-lattice constant of BaSrTi 2O6.

Using these definitions, we examine the PS obtained by Eqs. (1) and (2). The first comparison is that 

with experiments: In Fig. 7 , the two black square s represent the comparison between experimental PS of 

BaTiO 3 [28 ] and PS estimated by Eqs. (1) and (2) using experimental 

zTi -O2 and 

zTi -O1 of BaTiO 3 [27 ].

The second comparison is the validity for the alloys of BaTiO 3 and SrTiO 3 (CaTiO 3): The two red circle s

represent the comparison of ab initio PS of BaSrTi 2O6 with PS estimated by Eqs. (1) and (2) using ab initio 

zTi -O2 and 

zTi -O1 of BaSrTi 2O6. Similarly, the comparisons of Ba 2SrTi 3O9 and BaCaSrTi 3O9 are shown. 

The third comparison in Fig. 7 is the validity for PS // a-axis in the unit cell of Sr 4Ti 4O12 , where O2 ’s

on the diagonal positions (illustration of Fig. 7 ) are rotating around the Ti -O1 axis , i.e., c-axis . In this case, 

we assumed O* as O1 of Fig. 1 (a) , i.e. oxyg ens above and below Ti in the green -framed illustration of F ig. 7 .

The green diamond in Fig. 7 represents the comparison between ab initio PS and PS estimated by Eqs. (1) and 10 

(2) using ab initio 

zTi -O2. All the three comparisons confirm the validity of Eqs. (1) and (2) .

The variation of local PS within parallel and headon domains of BaTiO 3 is shown in F igs. 8(a) and 8 (b ), 

where the local PS’s were estimated by Eqs. (1) and (2) and ab initio calculation s of ex tracted 5 -atom 

unitcell s like Fig. 1(a) . The distribution of local PS in the parallel domains agreed with literature [29, 30 ].

zTi -O2 and 

zTi -O1 used in Eqs. (1) and (2) was those of the extracted 5 -atom unit cell s. The z-axis is along 

c-axis, and the parallel domain runs along x-axis ( a-axis). In both types of domains , local PS’s by Eqs. (1) 

and (2) agreed excellently with local PS’s by ab initio calculation . In addition, small x-component s of PS

(PSx) exist ed in parallel domain, and local PSx’s by ab initio calculation and Eqs. (1) and (2) agreed mutually. 

Headon domains like F ig. 8 (b ) were conventionally unstable but predicted to exist even in the absence of 

defects owing to the formation of free electron/hole layers [31 , 32 ], of which experiments are recently 

frequently reported. 

5. Summary 

The data set s of PS vs. c rystallographic parameters of Ba TiO 3 and S rTiO 3 under various conditions 

calculated with different XC functionals were found to lie precisely on a single curve (Figs. 5(b), 5(c) and 6) ,

despite the wide variations of these data (Fig. 3) . Here, the origin of these variation s of PS was found due to 

the variation s of crystallographic parameters. Because such variations of crystallographic parameters we re 

expected to exist in experiments, the parameters ’ theoretical variations were regarded as the experimental 

ones. Thes e considerations have yielded em pirical analytical formula s of PS by 

zTi -O2 ,

zTi -O1,

zO2, and 

zO1 (Table 4) , where 

zO1 and so forth are explaine d in Fig. 1(a) and Table 2. 

The parameters that correlated best with PS were 

zTi -O2 ,

zTi -O1, and 

zO2 , suggesting the importance 

of oxygen position and, hence, requ esting accurate detection of oxygen position s. The coefficients in the 

formulas using th ese displacements are in Table 4 .

The validity of the formula s based on 

zTi -O2 and 

zTi -O1 (Eqs. (1) and (2) ) was successfully shown in 

comparison with experiments at RT , Ba TiO 3-SrTiO 3 (-Ca TiO 3) alloy s, a complicated unit cell ( Sr 4Ti 4O12 ), a

parallel domain, and a headon domain. As shown in Fig. 7, t he present formula s such as Eq. (1) work for PS

at any temperature as long as ion positions such as at that temperature is used . Therefore, ion positions given 

by various kinds of experiments can be used for the present formulas .11 

The validity of Eqs. (1) and (2) in application to Ba TiO 3-SrTiO 3 all oy s shows that Eqs . (1) and (2) are 

applicable to Ba TiO 3-SrTiO 3 systems with good accuracy . However, it did not work for Pb TiO 3, where the 

major difference between Pb TiO 3 and Ba TiO 3-SrTiO 3 is the bonding of A -site atom with Ti [6]. Therefore, 

Eqs. (1) and (2) may hold for titanate perovskites in which t he bonding between Ti and A-site atom is weak ,

although t he inclusion of Ca may decrease the accuracy of Eqs. (1) and (2) .

For an extremely large strain, e.g., uext   0.03  in both Ba TiO 3 and S rTiO 3, the correlations between 

PS and displacements and those bet ween properties and strain changed slightly . In addition, the unit cell 

volume increased with |uext | for uext   0.03 , while it decreased with |uext | for uext   0.02.  This suggests that 

Ba TiO 3 and S rTiO 3 transforms into new state s by an extremely large strain. This view is supported by the 

sharp enhancement of the bonding between atoms in both BaTiO 3 and SrTiO 3 in the charge density 

 for uext 

 -0.03 ( Fig. 2 ).

The present correlation s of PS with 

zO2 and 

zO1 far better than those with 

zTi verifies empirically 

oxygen -driven ferroelectricity by Bilz et al. [8] for Ba TiO 3-SrTiO 3 system, where this mechanism is 

considered more dominant in SrTiO 3 than in BaTiO 3. Accordingly, the conventional identifier 

zTi [7] was 

inaccurate and had possibility to estimate PS incorrectly. This may be imp ortant for delicate cases such as 

flux -closure domain at strained interface [7] . In addition , the earlier prediction of stable headon domains 

without aid of defect s [31, 32] was confirmed.

Appen dix: How to use the formul as 

The formulas in Table 4 are for the case of  PS  0. For  PS < 0, the sign of A and C should be reversed. 

Here, the convention of the sign of  PS is such that  PS > 0 for Ti –O2 > 0, which may be opposite to the 

convention of ab initio calculations. 12 

These formulas are for  PS in 5 -atom unit cell , and the length of th e lattice along  PS is unity. In 

application t o ferroelectrics consisting of many unitcells , local  PS, i.e.  PS in each 5 -atom unit cell is 

calculated , and the average of local  PS gives the bulk  PS. For example, local  PS in BaSrTi 2O6 in Fig. 7 is 

calculated as follows: 

By denoting the z coordinates of Ba, Sr, two Ti ’s, two O2 ’s and two O1 ’s as zBa, zSr, zTi 1, zTi 2, zO2 1,

zO2 2, zO1 Ba and zO1 Sr , respectively, 

zTi -O2  = (zTi 1  zO2 1)/(zSr  zBa) and 

zTi -O2  = (zTi 2  zO2 2)/(zBa*  zSr), 

where zBa*= 1 and zBa = 0 . Here, Ti -O2 distance is normalized by the local c lattice constants zSr – zBa 

or zBa*  zSr. Alternatively, we may approximate (zSr  zBa)  (zBa*  zSr)  cBST /2, where cBST is the 

c lattice constant of BaSrTi 2O6. Similarly, by noting that the distance between Ti and O1 in paraelectric 

phase is 0.5, 

zTi -O1 = (zTi 1  zO1 Ba )/(zSr  zBa)  0.5 and 

zTi -O1 = (zTi 2 – zO1 Sr )/(zBa*  zSr)  0.5. 

Local  PS is obtained by the substitutions of these 

zTi -O2  and 

zTi -O1 into Eqs. (1) and (2) . For general 

case of  PS // layer -direction, e.g., headon domain (Fig. 8(b)), 

zTi -O2 k = (zTi k  zO2 k)/(zA k+1  zA k) and 

zTi -O1k = (zTi k  zO1 k)/(zA k+1  zA k)  0.5, 

where zAk is the z coordinate of A -site ion in the kth unit cell . For general case of  PS  layer -direction, e.g., 

parallel domain (Fig. 8(a)) 

zTi -O2 k = (zTi k  zO2 k) and 

zTi -O1k = (zTi k  zO1 k)  0.5. 

Alternatively, we may approximate zA k+1  zA k  cTOT /n except for the surfaces, where cTOT is the total c

lattice constant of the system, i.e., supercell and n is the number of 5 -atom unitcells in the supercell. 

In applications of these formulas, especially to materials that are not BaTiO 3-SrTiO 3, the user should 

test them by comparing a few  PS’s given by the formulas with those given by the other methods such as 

experiments or Berry phase calculations. 13
