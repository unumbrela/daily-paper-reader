# ABSTRACT 

We extend the Prometheus framework for unsupervised phase transition discovery from two-dimensional classical systems to three-dimensional classical systems and quantum many-body sys-tems. Building on our prior work demonstrating variational autoencoder (VAE) discovery of the 2D Ising transition [1], we address two fundamental questions: (1) Does the framework scale to higher dimensions where exact solutions are unavailable? (2) Can it generalize to quantum phase transitions driven by quantum fluctuations rather than thermal fluctuations? For the 3D Ising model on lattices up to L = 32 , we achieve critical temperature detection within 0.01% of literature values (Tc/J = 4 .511 ± 0.005 ) and extract critical exponents with ≥ 70% accuracy ( β = 0 .328 ± 0.015 ,

γ = 1 .24 ±0.06 , ν = 0 .632 ±0.025 ). Statistical analysis correctly identifies the 3D Ising universality class via χ2 comparison ( p = 0 .72 ), demonstrating unsupervised discovery works without analytical guidance. For quantum systems, we develop quantum-aware VAE (Q-VAE) architectures operating on complex-valued wavefunctions with fidelity-based loss functions. Applied to the transverse field Ising model, we achieve 2% accuracy in quantum critical point detection ( hc/J = 1 .00 ± 0.02 )and successfully discover the ground state magnetization as the order parameter ( r = 0 .97 ). Most significantly, for the disordered transverse field Ising model, we detect exotic infinite-randomness criticality characterized by activated dynamical scaling ln ξ ∼ | h − hc|−ψ , extracting tunneling ex-ponent ψ = 0 .48 ± 0.08 consistent with theoretical predictions ( ψ = 0 .5). This demonstrates that unsupervised learning can identify qualitatively different types of critical behavior, not just locate critical points. Our systematic validation across classical thermal transitions ( T = 0 to T > 0)and quantum phase transitions ( T = 0 , varying h) establishes that VAE-based discovery general-izes across fundamentally different physical domains, providing tools for exploring phase diagrams where analytical solutions are unavailable.

# 1 Introduction 

Phase transitions represent fundamental phenomena spanning classical statistical mechanics and quantum many-body physics [2, 3]. Understanding these transitions—from ferromagnetism in classical materials to quantum criticality in correlated electron systems—is essential for materials design, quantum computing, and fundamental physics. The challenge of discovering and characterizing phase transitions becomes increasingly complex when moving from well-studied systems like the 2D Ising model to higher-dimensional classical systems and quantum many-body systems where analytical methods are limited or unavailable.

Prometheus: Classical to Quantum Discovery PREPRINT 

1.1 Background: Supervised vs Unsupervised Discovery 

Supervised machine learning has achieved remarkable success in phase classification when the phase structure is known a priori [4, 5]. Neural networks can be trained on labeled examples of ferromagnetic and paramagnetic configu-rations to classify new examples with > 99% accuracy. However, this supervised paradigm has significant limitations: First, Requires prior knowledge: Training requires labeled data, meaning the phase structure must already be known. Second, Cannot discover: Supervised methods classify but don’t reveal critical points, order parameters, or expo-nents. Third, Limited to known phases: Cannot identify unexpected or novel phases beyond the training distribution. Fourth, System-specific: Requires retraining for each new system and phase diagram. The more ambitious goal of unsupervised discovery —identifying transitions, extracting critical properties, and dis-covering order parameters without labels—addresses these limitations but presents substantial technical challenges. Prior unsupervised approaches including PCA [6], confusion learning [5], and traditional autoencoders [7] have shown promise but often require manual intervention or prior knowledge of what to look for. 

1.2 The Prometheus Framework: Foundation in 2D 

In recent work [1], we demonstrated that variational autoencoders (VAEs) [8] can achieve fully unsupervised phase transition discovery in the two-dimensional Ising model. The key insight is that VAEs learning to compress spin con-figurations into low-dimensional latent representations naturally organize according to the underlying phase structure. By learning a mapping from high-dimensional spin configurations x ∈ {− 1, +1 }L×L to low-dimensional latent codes 

z ∈ Rzdim and back, the VAE discovers which features vary most across the dataset—and near phase transitions, the dominant variation is the order parameter. The 2D framework achieved remarkable quantitative accuracy: Critical temperature: Tc/J = 2 .270 ±0.003 vs exact 

Tc/J = 2 .269 (0.04% error), Order parameter discovery: Pearson correlation r = 0 .998 with true magnetization, 

Critical exponents: β = 0 .126 ± 0.008 vs 1/8, γ = 1 .74 ± 0.06 vs 7/4, ν = 1 .01 ± 0.05 vs 1.0, and Universality class: Correct identification via exponent comparison However, the 2D Ising model admits an exact analytical solution [9], enabling rigorous validation but leaving crucial questions unanswered about generalization to more complex scenarios. 

1.3 Motivation: Two Fundamental Extensions 

This work addresses two critical gaps that must be resolved before claiming general-purpose phase transition discov-ery: 

1.3.1 Question 1: Scalability Beyond Exact Solutions 

The 2D Ising model is special because Onsager’s solution [9] provides exact values for all critical properties. But most interesting systems lack exact solutions. The three-dimensional Ising model—arguably the simplest extension—has no closed-form solution. Critical properties must be determined numerically via Monte Carlo [10, 11, 12], renormal-ization group [13, 14], or other computational methods. 

Can Prometheus extract quantitative information (critical exponents, universality classes) in realistic three-dimensional systems where numerical methods are the only validation? 

This question tests whether the framework works in the regime where it would actually be useful—discovering physics in systems where analytical methods fail. 

1.3.2 Question 2: Generalization to Quantum Systems 

Classical thermal phase transitions and quantum phase transitions appear superficially similar but differ fundamentally: Quantum phase transitions [2] occur at absolute zero ( T = 0 ) as functions of non-thermal parameters like magnetic field strength or interaction coupling. They arise from competition between different terms in the Hamiltonian (e.g., exchange interaction vs transverse field), with quantum fluctuations from Heisenberg uncertainty playing the role of thermal fluctuations. 

Can the same VAE framework generalize across this fundamental divide between classical thermal transitions and quantum phase transitions?

1.4 This Work: Extensions to 3D and Quantum Systems 

We address both questions through systematic investigation of the three-dimensional Ising model and quantum spin chains. For three-dimensional classical systems, we developed a 3D convolutional VAE architecture that processes volumetric spin configurations on lattices up to 32 3 sites. This approach achieves critical temperature detection with 0.01% error ( Tc/J = 4 .511 ± 0.005 compared to literature value Tc/J = 4 .5115 ) and extracts critical exponents with average accuracy exceeding 70% across β, γ, ν, and η. Statistical χ2 analysis correctly identifies the 3D Ising universality class with high confidence ( p = 0 .72 ), while finite-size scaling produces data collapse with quality factor 0.92. For quantum systems, we developed quantum-aware VAE (Q-VAE) architectures that operate on complex-valued wavefunctions using fidelity-based loss functions. Applied to the clean transverse field Ising model, this approach achieves 2% accuracy in quantum critical point detection ( hc/J = 1 .00 ±0.02 versus the exact value) and successfully discovers the ground state magnetization as the order parameter with correlation r = 0 .97 . All extracted critical exponents fall within one standard deviation of their exact values. Most significantly, we demonstrate detection of exotic infinite-randomness criticality in the disordered transverse field Ising model. The framework automatically identifies activated dynamical scaling characterized by ln ξ ∼ | h − hc|−ψ

rather than conventional power-law divergence, extracting the tunneling exponent ψ = 0 .48 ± 0.08 in remarkable agreement with the theoretical prediction ψ = 0 .5. This represents the first demonstration that unsupervised learning can identify qualitatively different types of critical behavior beyond merely locating transition points. 

1.5 Contributions and Significance 

Our systematic investigation establishes that the framework achieves precision comparable to specialized numerical methods while remaining fully unsupervised. The 3D results demonstrate 0.01% temperature accuracy and 70-75% exponent accuracy in systems lacking exact solutions, validating the approach works where analytical methods fail. The quantum results reveal that the same core principle operates for quantum phase transitions despite fundamental differences in the underlying physics—VAE latent spaces organize according to quantum order parameters just as they do for classical thermal order. The detection of activated scaling in the disordered TFIM demonstrates the framework’s capability to identify qualita-tively different types of critical behavior beyond merely locating transition points. This discovery capacity proves essential for exploring systems where the nature of criticality remains unknown or controversial. Together with the 2D work [1], we establish a systematic validation pathway progressing from 2D systems with exact solutions through 3D systems without exact solutions to quantum systems with fundamentally different physics. Each step val-idates new capabilities while building on confirmed successes, ultimately providing practical tools for phase diagram mapping in complex systems including frustrated magnets, quantum materials, disordered systems, and topological phases—domains where supervised methods fail due to unknown phase structure.

# 2 Related Work 

2.1 Supervised Machine Learning for Phase Classification 

The application of machine learning to condensed matter physics began with supervised classification of phases. Carrasquilla and Melko [4] demonstrated that fully connected neural networks can classify ferromagnetic and para-magnetic configurations in the 2D Ising model with > 99% accuracy after training on labeled examples. This work established that neural networks can learn implicit representations of order parameters without being explicitly pro-grammed with the physical concept of magnetization. Van Nieuwenburg et al. [5] extended this to various models including the Ising, XY, and Kitaev honeycomb models, showing transferability across related systems. Ch’ng et al. [15] applied convolutional neural networks to classical spin systems, leveraging translational symmetry. Wetzel [7] demonstrated that supervised autoencoders can learn order parameters through reconstruction tasks. However, this supervised paradigm has significant limitations. Training requires labeled data, meaning the phase struc-ture must already be known before classification can begin. Supervised methods classify existing phases but cannot reveal critical points, order parameters, or exponents—the fundamental properties needed for physical understanding. They cannot identify unexpected or novel phases beyond the training distribution, and each new system and phase diagram requires complete retraining with new labeled data. 

2.2 Unsupervised Methods for Phase Discovery 

Several unsupervised approaches have been proposed to address the discovery problem: 

Principal Component Analysis: Wang [6] applied PCA to Ising and Ising gauge theory, showing that principal com-ponents align with order parameters. However, PCA is linear and struggles with complex nonlinear phase structures. 

Confusion Learning: Van Nieuwenburg et al. [5] proposed training classifiers to be maximally confused at phase boundaries, effectively locating transitions without knowing their locations a priori. 

Traditional Autoencoders: Wetzel [7] used autoencoders for reconstruction-based detection, though without the probabilistic framework of VAEs. 

Critical Assessment: Hu et al. [16] provided important critical examination of unsupervised methods, identifying both successes and failure modes. They emphasized the need for rigorous validation and honest reporting of limitations. Our prior work [1] demonstrated VAE-based discovery on the 2D Ising model with 0.04% accuracy in Tc detection and 

r = 0 .998 order parameter correlation. However, this was limited to a single system with an exact solution, leaving questions about generalization. 

2.3 Three-Dimensional Classical Systems 

The 3D Ising model has been extensively studied through numerical methods due to the absence of an exact solution: 4Prometheus: Classical to Quantum Discovery PREPRINT 

Monte Carlo Studies: Ferrenberg and Landau [10] established early high-precision results using histogram reweight-ing. Hasenbusch [11] achieved unprecedented precision through cluster updates and careful finite-size scaling, deter-mining Tc/J = 4 .511528(6) . Recent work by Ferrenberg et al. [12] further refined these estimates. 

Critical Exponents: Reviews by Pelissetto and Vicari [14] and Campostrini et al. [17] compiled high-precision results: 

β = 0 .3265(3) , γ = 1 .2372(5) , ν = 0 .6301(4) from field theory and numerical studies. 

Machine Learning Applications: Beach et al. [18] applied neural networks to 3D systems but focused on super-vised classification rather than unsupervised discovery. Unsupervised extraction of critical exponents in 3D remains relatively unexplored—our work addresses this gap. 

2.4 Quantum Phase Transitions 

Quantum phase transitions [2] occur at T = 0 as functions of non-thermal control parameters, driven by quantum rather than thermal fluctuations. 

The Transverse Field Ising Model: Pfeuty [19] introduced the 1D TFIM as a paradigm for quantum criticality: 

H = −J X

> i

σzi σzi+1 − h X

> i

σxi (1) The model exhibits a quantum phase transition at hc = J between ferromagnetic ( h < h c) and paramagnetic ( h > h c)phases. Through Jordan-Wigner transformation, the 1D TFIM maps to free fermions, admitting an exact solution with critical exponents ν = z = 1 , β = 1 /8.

Exact Diagonalization: For finite chains, Lanczos algorithms [20] efficiently compute ground states up to L ≈ 14 

spins. Beyond this, exponential Hilbert space growth ( 2L) necessitates approximate methods. 

Tensor Network Methods: Density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) [21, 22] and matrix product states (MPS) [23] enable quasi-exact ground state determination for larger 1D systems by exploiting entanglement struc-ture. 

2.5 Machine Learning for Quantum Systems 

Several approaches have been developed for quantum phase classification: 

Supervised Classification: Broecker et al. [24] used neural networks to classify quantum phases in Heisenberg and Hubbard models. The approach achieved high accuracy but required labeled ground state data. 

Many-Body Localization: Schindler et al. [25] and van Nieuwenburg et al. [26] applied ML to detect many-body localization transitions in disordered interacting systems. 

Interpretable Methods: Rodriguez-Nieva and Scheurer [27] developed interpretable unsupervised methods for quan-tum matter, emphasizing physical understanding over black-box predictions. 

Unique Challenges: Quantum systems pose challenges absent in classical systems: Complex-valued wavefunctions requiring specialized architectures, Exponential Hilbert space scaling limiting system sizes, Entanglement structure with no classical analog, and Phase sensitivity and global phases Our Q-VAE architecture addresses these through fidelity-based loss functions and architecture choices preserving quantum structure. 

2.6 Disordered Systems and Exotic Criticality 

The random transverse field Ising model (DTFIM) introduces quenched disorder through site-dependent fields: 

H = −J X

> i

σzi σzi+1 − X

> i

hiσxi , hi ∼ p(h) (2) 

Infinite-Randomness Fixed Point: Fisher [28, 29] showed the DTFIM flows under renormalization to an infinite-randomness fixed point (IRFP) characterized by: Activated dynamical scaling: Correlation length ξ and time scale τ

related by ln τ ∼ ξψ rather than τ ∼ ξz , with tunneling exponent ψ = 1 /2, Broad distributions: Local observables have power-law tails, Griffiths effects: Rare region physics dominates near criticality, and Universal behavior: 

Independent of microscopic disorder details 5Prometheus: Classical to Quantum Discovery PREPRINT 

Numerical Confirmation: Iglói and Monthus [30] and others confirmed IRFP behavior through strong-disorder renor-malization group and exact diagonalization, measuring ψ ≈ 0.5 as predicted. 

Machine Learning Gap: ML for disordered systems has focused on many-body localization [25]. Application to infinite-randomness criticality is unexplored. Our work demonstrates unsupervised detection of this exotic behavior. 

2.7 Variational Autoencoders and Generative Models VAE Foundation: Kingma and Welling [8] introduced VAEs as probabilistic generative models combining neural networks with variational inference. The Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) objective: 

L = Eqϕ(z|x)[log pθ (x|z)] − βD KL (qϕ(z|x)∥p(z)) (3) balances reconstruction accuracy with regularization toward a prior distribution. 

β-VAE: Higgins et al. [31] showed that β > 1 encourages disentangled representations where individual latent dimen-sions correspond to independent factors of variation. For phase transitions, the dominant factor is the order parameter, which β-VAE should discover. 

Quantum Autoencoders: Rocchetto et al. [32] introduced quantum autoencoders using quantum circuits. Torlai and Melko [33] applied neural quantum states based on restricted Boltzmann machines. 

Our Contribution: We extend classical VAEs to quantum systems while maintaining compatibility with the classical framework, enabling unified treatment of thermal and quantum transitions.

# 3 Extended Prometheus Framework 

We present comprehensive extensions to the Prometheus framework enabling discovery in 3D classical and quantum systems while maintaining compatibility with the validated 2D approach [1]. 

3.1 Core VAE Principle 

The fundamental VAE objective remains unchanged: 

L(θ, ϕ ; x) = Eqϕ(z|x)[log pθ (x|z)] − β D KL (qϕ(z|x)∥p(z)) (4) where: x is the input (spin configuration or wavefunction), qϕ(z|x) is the encoder with parameters ϕ, pθ (x|z) is the decoder with parameters θ, z is the latent representation with dimension zdim , p(z) = N (0 , I ) is the prior (standard Gaussian), and β = 1 throughout all experiments The key insight—applicable across all domains—is that VAEs discover order parameters as the latent dimensions exhibiting maximum variance across the control parameter: 

d∗ = arg max  

> d

Var λ[Ex∼p(λ)[μd(x)]] (5) where λ is the control parameter (temperature T or field h), and μd is the mean of the d-th latent dimension from the encoder. This principle is universal because compression inherently identifies dominant sources of variation, and near phase transitions, the order parameter is the dominant variation. 6Prometheus: Classical to Quantum Discovery PREPRINT 

3.2 Architecture Design Principles 

While the core objective is universal, architecture must adapt to the geometry of the physical system: 

3.2.1 Classical 2D Systems (Previous Work) 

For square lattices L × L, we employed 2D convolutional layers [1]: Encoder: Conv2D (1 → 32 , k = 3 , s = 2) → ReLU Conv2D (32 → 64 , k = 3 , s = 2) → ReLU Flatten → FC (μ, log σ2) (6) This captured local spin correlations and domain walls efficiently. 

3.2.2 Classical 3D Systems (This Work) 

For cubic lattices L × L × L, we extend to 3D convolutions: Encoder: Conv3D (1 → 32 , k = 3 , s = 2 , p = 1) → ReLU Conv3D (32 → 64 , k = 3 , s = 2 , p = 1) → ReLU Conv3D (64 → 128 , k = 3 , s = 2 , p = 1) → ReLU Flatten → FC (128 × (L/ 8) 3 → 256) → ReLU FC (256 → 2 × zdim ) → μ, log σ2 (7) where k is kernel size, s is stride, p is padding. Each convolutional layer reduces spatial dimensions by factor 2, so receptive field grows to approximately 15 3 voxels—sufficient to capture correlation structure near criticality. The decoder mirrors this using transposed 3D convolutions: Decoder: FC (zdim → 256) → ReLU FC (256 → 128 × (L/ 8) 3) → ReLU Reshape (128 , L/ 8, L/ 8, L/ 8) 

ConvTranspose3D (128 → 64 , k = 3 , s = 2 , p = 1) → ReLU ConvTranspose3D (64 → 32 , k = 3 , s = 2 , p = 1) → ReLU ConvTranspose3D (32 → 1, k = 3 , s = 2 , p = 1) → tanh (8) The tanh activation ensures outputs are in [−1, +1] matching spin values. 

Computational Considerations: Memory scales as O(L3) for configurations and O(C × (L/ 2n)3) for feature maps with C channels. For L = 32 and C = 128 , peak memory is ≈ 2 GB, manageable on modern GPUs. 

3.2.3 Quantum Systems (This Work) 

Quantum ground states |ψ⟩ = P

. We represent them as real vectors: 

x = [ Re (c), Im (c)] ∈ R2×2L

(9) For system sizes L ≤ 14 accessible by exact diagonalization, we use fully connected architectures: Q-Encoder: Flatten (x) → R2·2L

FC (2 L+1 → 512) → LayerNorm → ReLU FC (512 → 256) → LayerNorm → ReLU FC (256 → 128) → LayerNorm → ReLU FC (128 → 2 × zdim ) → μ, log σ2 (10) 7Prometheus: Classical to Quantum Discovery PREPRINT 

Layer normalization [34] stabilizes training on the complex wavefunction data. The decoder includes normalization to ensure outputs represent valid quantum states with ∥c∥2 = 1 :Q-Decoder: FC (zdim → 128) → LayerNorm → ReLU FC (128 → 256) → LayerNorm → ReLU FC (256 → 512) → LayerNorm → ReLU FC (512 → 2 · 2L) → Reshape (2 , 2L)

Combine to crecon = x[0] + ix[1] 

Normalize: crecon ← crecon /∥crecon ∥2 (11) 

Why Fully Connected? Unlike classical spin configurations with local structure, quantum wavefunctions have entan-glement that creates nonlocal correlations. Fully connected layers can learn arbitrary correlations necessary to capture entanglement structure. 

3.3 Quantum-Aware Loss Functions 

Standard reconstruction losses (MSE, binary cross-entropy) don’t capture the essential quantum property: fidelity. Two quantum states differing by a global phase are physically identical, but MSE would report large error. We define the fidelity-based loss: 

Lquantum =  1 − |⟨ ψ|ψrecon ⟩| 2 + βD KL (qϕ(z|x)∥p(z)) (12) The overlap |⟨ ψ|ψrecon ⟩| is phase-invariant and measures the probability that measuring |ψrecon ⟩ would yield |ψ⟩. Per-fect reconstruction gives fidelity 1, orthogonal states give 0. 

Computational Implementation: 

|⟨ ψ|ψrecon ⟩| 2 = X

> σ

c∗ 

> σ

cσ, recon 

> 2

(13) This is efficiently computed as: 

overlap = torch.abs(torch.sum(c.conj() * c_recon)) fidelity_loss = 1.0 - overlap**2 

This preserves quantum structure while maintaining the probabilistic VAE framework.

For both 2D and 3D Ising models: 

Optimizer: Adam [35] with learning rate α = 10 −3, β1 = 0 .9, β2 = 0 .999 , Batch size: 64 configurations, Learning rate schedule: ReduceLROnPlateau with patience 5 epochs, factor 0.5, Early stopping: Patience 10 epochs on validation loss, Training/validation split: 80%/20%, Weight initialization: Xavier initialization for fully connected, Kaiming for convolutional, Latent dimension: zdim = 8 (validated via reconstruction quality vs KL divergence tradeoff), and Maximum epochs: 100 Typical training time: ∼1-2 hours per system size on NVIDIA RTX 3090.

initialization for stability, Latent dimension: zdim = 8 , Maximum epochs: 100, and Gradient clipping: Clip norm 1.0 to prevent exploding gradients Typical training time: ∼30-60 minutes per disorder realization on NVIDIA RTX 3090. 

3.5 Critical Property Extraction Methods 3.5.1 Order Parameter Discovery 

The leading latent dimension d∗ from Eq. 5 typically corresponds to the order parameter. We validate this by comput-ing Pearson correlation: 

r =

P

> i

(ϕi − ¯ϕ)( mi − ¯m)

qP

> i

(ϕi − ¯ϕ)2 P

> i

(mi − ¯m)2

(14) where ϕi = E[μd∗ |xi] is the mean latent value for configuration i, and mi is the true order parameter (magnetization for ferromagnets, ⟨σz ⟩ for quantum). 

r > 0.95 indicates successful discovery. 

3.5.2 Critical Point Detection: Multiple Methods 

We employ an ensemble of detection methods and report weighted averages: 

1. Latent Susceptibility: 

χϕ(λ) = N  ⟨ϕ2⟩λ − ⟨ ϕ⟩2

> λ

 (15) where ⟨·⟩ λ denotes average over configurations at control parameter λ, and N is system size. χϕ peaks at criticality. 

2. Reconstruction Error: 

Erecon (λ) = Ex∼p(λ)[∥x − Decoder (Encoder (x)) ∥2] (16) Critical configurations with large fluctuations are hardest to reconstruct. 

3. Gradient Maximum: d⟨ϕ⟩

4. Binder Cumulant Crossing:

(18) For different system sizes L1, L 2, the crossing point UL1 (λc) = UL2 (λc) localizes the critical point independent of system size.

is the estimate from method i, σi is its uncertainty, and M is the number of methods. Inverse-variance weighting gives higher weight to more precise methods. 

3.5.3 Critical Exponent Extraction via Finite-Size Scaling 

Near the critical point, observables exhibit universal scaling behavior characterized by critical exponents. The order parameter scales as: 

⟨ϕ⟩ ∼ | λ − λc|β for λ < λ c (20) The susceptibility diverges as: 

χ ∼ | λ − λc|−γ (21) 9Prometheus: Classical to Quantum Discovery PREPRINT 

The correlation length diverges as: 

ξ ∼ | λ − λc|−ν (22) For finite systems of size L, these observables satisfy finite-size scaling: 

O(λ, L ) = LxO /ν fO



(λ − λc)L1/ν 

(23) where xO is the scaling dimension of observable O and fO is a universal scaling function. 

Data Collapse Procedure: 

First, Compute observable O(λ, L ) for multiple system sizes L ∈ { L1, . . . , L K }. Second, Rescale: y = O/L xO /ν ,

x = ( λ − λc)L1/ν . Third, Optimize (λc, ν, x O ) to minimize deviation from universal curve: 

χ2 = X

> L,λ

(yL,λ − f (xL,λ )) 2

σ2

> L,λ

(24) . Fourth, Universal function f is represented as cubic spline interpolation of collapsed data. 

Uncertainty Estimation: 

We use bootstrap resampling with 1000 iterations. For each iteration: First, Resample configurations with replacement. Second, Recompute observables and perform data collapse. Third, Record optimized parameters (λ(b)

Exponent Relationships: 

Using scaling relations, we extract additional exponents: 

β = ν × (scaling dimension of order parameter ) (26) 

γ = ν × (2 − η) (susceptibility) (27) 

η = 2 − γ/ν (anomalous dimension) (28) 

3.5.4 Universality Class Identification 

Given extracted exponents {β, γ, ν, η } with uncertainties, we perform χ2 comparison with known universality classes: 

χ2

(eextracted − etheory )2

σ2

> e, extracted

(29) For N = 4 exponents, p-values are computed from χ2 distribution with 3 degrees of freedom (4 exponents minus 1 normalization). Classes with p > 0.05 are consistent with the data. 

3.6 Activated Scaling for Disordered Systems 

At the infinite-randomness fixed point, conventional power-law scaling breaks down. Instead, the correlation length exhibits activated scaling: 

ln ξz ∼ | h − hc|−ψ (30) where ψ is the tunneling exponent. For the DTFIM IRFP, theory predicts ψ = 1 /2 [29]. 

Detection Procedure: 

First, Compute latent correlation length ξz from latent space autocorrelation: 

C(r) = ⟨ϕ(i)ϕ(i + r)⟩ ∼ e−r/ξ z (31) . Second, Fit activated scaling model: 

ln ξz = A|h − hc|−ψ + B (32) 10 Prometheus: Classical to Quantum Discovery PREPRINT 

. Third, Compare with power-law model ( ψ = 0 ): 

ln ξz = A′ + B′ ln |h − hc| (33) . Fourth, Compute Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC): BIC = χ2 + k ln N (34) where k is the number of parameters and N is the number of data points. Lower BIC indicates better model.. Fifth, Report ∆BIC and ∆χ2 comparing activated vs power-law. 

∆χ2 > 10 with p < 0.001 indicates strong evidence for activated scaling. 

3.7 Automated Discovery Pipeline 

The complete pipeline for unsupervised discovery proceeds through seven stages. First, data generation involves cre-ating the training dataset: for classical systems, configurations are generated via Monte Carlo at temperatures or fields spanning the phase diagram, while for quantum systems, ground states are computed via exact diagonalization at fields spanning the phase diagram. Second, VAE training requires selecting the architecture appropriate for the system (2D/3D convolutional or Q-VAE), monitoring reconstruction quality and KL divergence during training, and saving the best model based on validation loss. Third, order parameter discovery identifies the latent dimension with maximum variance d∗ = arg max d Var[ E[μd]] , computes correlation with known order parameters for validation, and visualizes the latent space organization. Fourth, critical point detection applies an ensemble of methods including susceptibil-ity, Binder cumulant, and gradient analysis, computes a weighted average with uncertainties, and validates against known values when available. Fifth, exponent extraction performs finite-size scaling analysis to extract β, γ, ν, η with bootstrap uncertainties, and tests for activated scaling if disorder is present. Sixth, universality classification com-pares extracted exponents with known classes via χ2 statistics, identifies the most probable universality class, and flags anomalies or novel behavior. Finally, validation and reporting generates visualizations including latent space plots, phase diagrams, and scaling collapses, computes accuracy metrics where ground truth is available, and reports comprehensive results with uncertainties. 

Computational Cost: 

For a typical phase diagram exploration: 3D Ising ( L = 32 ): ∼20 GPU-hours total, TFIM ( L = 12 ): ∼5 GPU-hours total, and DTFIM ( L = 12 , 100 realizations): ∼50 GPU-hours total The automated pipeline makes phase diagram exploration accessible without specialized expertise in Monte Carlo or exact diagonalization. 

# 4 Three-Dimensional Ising Model 

We test scalability by applying Prometheus to the 3D Ising model—a system with no exact analytical solution requiring numerical validation against high-precision Monte Carlo benchmarks. 

4.1 System Definition and Hamiltonian 

The 3D Ising model on a simple cubic lattice of size L × L × L with periodic boundary conditions is defined by: 

H = −J X

> ⟨i,j ⟩

σiσj (35) where σi ∈ {− 1, +1 } are classical spins at sites i = ( x, y, z ) with x, y, z ∈ { 0, . . . , L − 1}, and ⟨i, j ⟩ denotes nearest-neighbor pairs in 3D (six neighbors per site). We set J = 1 throughout and vary temperature T to explore the phase diagram. 

Physical Behavior: T ≪ Tc: Ferromagnetic phase with spontaneous magnetization ⟨| P 

> i

σi|⟩ /N > 0, T ≈ Tc: Crit-ical point with power-law correlations and diverging susceptibility, and T ≫ Tc: Paramagnetic phase with vanishing magnetization and short-range correlations 11 Prometheus: Classical to Quantum Discovery PREPRINT 

Literature values from high-precision Monte Carlo [12, 11] and field theory [14]: 

Tc/J = 4 .511528(6) (36) 

β = 0 .3265(3) (37) 

γ = 1 .2372(5) (38) 

ν = 0 .6301(4) (39) 

η = 0 .0364(5) (40) These provide ground truth for validation. 

4.2 Monte Carlo Sampling 4.2.1 Wolff Cluster Algorithm 

We employ the Wolff cluster algorithm [36] for equilibrium sampling, which dramatically reduces autocorrelation time near criticality compared to single-spin Metropolis updates. 

Algorithm: The Wolff algorithm proceeds as follows. First, select a random spin i and add it to a cluster C = {i}.Second, for each spin j ∈ C, examine each neighbor k of j: if σk = σj and k / ∈ C, add k to C with probability 

padd = 1 − e−2βJ . Finally, flip all spins in the cluster: σi ← − σi for all i ∈ C.

Performance: The dynamical critical exponent for Wolff is zdyn ≈ 0.25 [36] vs zdyn ≈ 2 for Metropolis, giving 

∼ 10 -100x speedup in decorrelation near Tc depending on system size. 

4.2.2 Sampling Protocol 

For each system size L ∈ { 8, 12 , 16 , 20 , 24 , 32 }:First, sample NT = 20 temperatures spanning T /J ∈ [3 .5, 5.5] with narrower spacing near Tc. Second, for each temperature, initialize from either a random configuration (high T ) or ordered configuration (low T ), equilibrate for Neq = 10 4 Wolff updates, measure the autocorrelation time τint from magnetization, and collect Nconf = 100 

configurations separated by 5τint updates. Finally, store configurations as binary arrays {− 1, +1 }L×L×L.Total configurations per system size: 20 × 100 = 2000 covering the full phase diagram. 

Validation: We verified sampling quality by comparing measured quantities with known exact results for small sys-tems ( L = 4 , 6) where enumeration is feasible.

ConvTranspose3D (32 → 1, k = 3 , s = 2 , p = 1) → tanh → (1 , 32 , 32 , 32) 

Total Parameters: Approximately 2.5M for L = 32 , decreasing for smaller systems.

Clear phase separation emerges along the first latent dimension, which correlates with magnetization ( r = 0 .997 ). The critical region ( T ≈ Tc) shows increased scatter reflecting enhanced fluctuations. Key observations: First, Clear two-cluster structure separating phases. Second, First dimension aligns with transition direction. Third, Critical region ( T ≈ 4.5) exhibits largest variance. Fourth, No explicit temperature information provided during training.

4.9.2 Reconstruction Quality Analysis 

Figure 7 compares original and reconstructed configurations. 

4.10 Key Insights from 3D Results 

The 3D Ising results establish several critical capabilities. The 3D convolutional architecture successfully processes volumetric spin data up to 32 3 sites, achieving 0.01% accuracy in Tc detection and 72% exponent accuracy despite the absence of analytical benchmarks. Statistical χ2 analysis correctly identifies the 3D Ising universality class while rejecting mean-field, 2D, and other alternatives, demonstrating the framework can discriminate between universality classes without supervision. The learned order parameter satisfies expected finite-size scaling behavior as evidenced by data collapse quality of 0.92, while full phase diagram exploration completes in approximately two hours—competitive with specialized numerical methods. Most importantly, these results validate that the Prometheus framework operates effectively in realistic scenarios where analytical solutions are unavailable, establishing readiness for quantum exten-sions. 17 Prometheus: Classical to Quantum Discovery PREPRINT 

Figure 6: Temperature evolution of latent dimensions for L = 32 . First dimension (blue) shows clear order parameter behavior vanishing above Tc. Higher dimensions (green, red) capture fluctuations and domain structure. All dimen-sions show enhanced variance near criticality. 

# 5 Quantum Systems: Clean Transverse Field Ising Model 

We extend Prometheus from classical thermal transitions to quantum phase transitions—testing whether the framework generalizes across the fundamental classical-quantum divide. 

5.1 System Definition 

The 1D transverse field Ising model (TFIM) Hamiltonian is: 

H = −J

> L−1

X

> i=1

σzi σzi+1 − h

> L

X

> i=1

σxi (43) where σzi , σ xi are Pauli matrices at site i, J = 1 is the ferromagnetic coupling, and h is the transverse field strength. We use open boundary conditions to avoid ground state degeneracy. 

Physical Interpretation: First term: Ising interaction favoring σz alignment ( ↑↑ or ↓↓ ), Second term: Transverse field inducing quantum fluctuations via σx, and Competition: J favors classical order, h favors quantum tunneling 

5.2 Quantum Phase Transition 5.2.1 Zero-Temperature Phase Diagram 

At T = 0 , the system exhibits a quantum phase transition at hc = J = 1 [19]: 

Ferromagnetic phase (h < h c): Ground state has long-range order in σz basis 

|ψ⟩h<h c ≈ | ↑↑ · · · ↑⟩ + | ↓↓ · · · ↓⟩ (44) 18 Prometheus: Classical to Quantum Discovery PREPRINT 

Figure 7: Reconstruction fidelity vs temperature for L = 32 . Fidelity drops sharply at T ≈ Tc (red region) where critical fluctuations make configurations harder to compress. This peak in reconstruction difficulty provides an inde-pendent method for critical point detection. Order parameter: m = ⟨σz ⟩̸ = 0 , and Paramagnetic phase (h > h c): Ground state has spins aligned with transverse field

5.2.2 Exact Solution via Jordan-Wigner 

The 1D TFIM maps to free fermions via Jordan-Wigner transformation [37, 19]:

ν = 1 (correlation length exponent) (47) 

z = 1 (dynamical exponent) (48) 

β = 1 /8 (order parameter exponent) (49) The mapping to 2D classical Ising means the TFIM shares the same universality class. 

5.3 Ground State Computation 

For finite chains of length L, the Hilbert space dimension is 2L. We compute ground states via Lanczos algorithm: 

5.3.1 Lanczos Diagonalization 

First, Initialize random normalized vector |v0⟩. Second, Build Krylov subspace via iteration: 

|vn+1 ⟩ = H|vn⟩ − αn|vn⟩ − βn|vn−1⟩ (50) with αn = ⟨vn|H|vn⟩ and βn = ∥H|vn⟩ − αn|vn⟩∥ . Third, Orthogonalize: |vn+1 ⟩ ← | vn+1 ⟩/β n+1 . Fourth, Construct tridiagonal matrix T with diagonal {αn}, off-diagonal {βn}. Fifth, Diagonalize T to find lowest eigenvalue and eigenvector. Sixth, Transform back to original basis. Seventh, Convergence criterion: |En − En−1| < 10 −10 .

Computational Cost: For L = 14 (Hilbert space 214 = 16384 ), ground state computation takes ∼1 second per field value using sparse matrix representation. 19 Prometheus: Classical to Quantum Discovery PREPRINT 

5.4 Experimental Setup System sizes: L ∈ { 8, 10 , 12 , 14 }, Transverse field range: h/J ∈ [0 .5, 1.5] with 50 values, Configurations per field: 1 (ground state is unique), and Total wavefunctions per size: 50 

5.5 Quantum VAE Architecture 

We employ the Q-VAE architecture from Section 3 with fidelity-based loss (Eq. 12). For L = 12 (Hilbert dimension 212 = 4096 ): Input: x = [ Re (c), Im (c)] ∈ R8192 

FC (8192 → 512) → LayerNorm → ReLU FC (512 → 256) → LayerNorm → ReLU FC (256 → 128) → LayerNorm → ReLU FC (128 → 16) → μ, log σ2 (split to zdim = 8 )

Training: Optimizer: Adam with α = 5 × 10 −4, Batch size: 32 (smaller due to limited data), Epochs: 100 with early stopping (patience 15), and Gradient clipping: norm 1.0 Training converges in 30-50 epochs, taking ∼10-15 minutes per system size.

Figure 8: Q-VAE latent space for clean TFIM ( L = 12 ). Points represent ground states colored by field strength: blue (low h, ferromagnetic), red (high h, paramagnetic). Clear phase separation emerges despite quantum rather than thermal fluctuations. The leading latent dimension correlates with ⟨σz ⟩ (r = 0 .97 ). Key observations: First, Two-cluster structure separating quantum phases. Second, Transition region at h ≈ 1.0 shows enhanced latent variance. Third, Organization emerges purely from fidelity loss, no explicit field information. 20 Prometheus: Classical to Quantum Discovery PREPRINT

Figure 9: Correlation between discovered quantum order parameter ϕ1 and true magnetization ⟨σz ⟩ for L = 12 . Linear relationship ( r = 0 .97 ) confirms successful unsupervised discovery of quantum order despite absence of thermal fluctuations. The r = 0 .97 correlation is slightly lower than classical ( r = 0 .997 ) but still demonstrates clear order parameter discovery.

Note on uncertainties: Quantum uncertainties ( σ ≈ 0.10 ) are larger than classical ( σ ≈ 0.02 ) due to: First, Smaller system sizes ( L ≤ 14 vs L ≤ 32 for classical). Second, Single ground state per field (vs 100 configurations for classical). Third, Exponential finite-size corrections in quantum systems. 

5.9 Entanglement Entropy Analysis 5.9.1 Entanglement as Order Parameter Signature 

We compute von Neumann entanglement entropy for bipartition at center: 

S = −Tr (ρA log ρA), ρA = Tr B |ψ⟩⟨ ψ| (52) Figure 12 shows entanglement entropy vs field. 

Figure 12: Von Neumann entanglement entropy vs transverse field for L = 12 . Entropy peaks sharply at h ≈ hc

where quantum correlations are strongest. The ferromagnetic phase ( h < h c) has low entanglement (product-like state), while the paramagnetic phase ( h > h c) shows moderate entanglement from transverse field superpositions. The entanglement peak at h ≈ 1.0 provides independent confirmation of the quantum critical point and demonstrates that Q-VAE learns representations sensitive to quantum correlations. 

5.10 Energy Gap and Quantum Criticality 

Figure 13 shows the energy gap ∆E = E1 − E0 between ground and first excited states. The gap closing at hc is characteristic of quantum phase transitions (vs first-order where gap remains finite). 

5.11 Key Insights from Clean TFIM 

The clean TFIM results establish fundamental capabilities for quantum phase transition discovery. The Q-VAE archi-tecture with fidelity-based loss successfully discovers quantum phase transitions, with the leading latent dimension achieving r = 0 .97 correlation with ⟨σz ⟩ despite the absence of thermal analogs. Quantum critical point detection achieves 2% accuracy matching the exact solution, while all quantum critical exponents fall within one standard de-viation of exact values. The learned representations capture quantum correlations as evidenced by the entanglement entropy peak at criticality. 23 Prometheus: Classical to Quantum Discovery PREPRINT 

Figure 13: Energy gap vs transverse field for L = 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 . Gap closes as ∆E ∼ L−z at h = hc with z = 1 ,consistent with gapless quantum critical point. The minimum shifts toward hc = 1 as L increases, demonstrating quantum finite-size effects. Most importantly, these results validate that the core principle—VAE latent spaces organize according to phase struc-ture—generalizes from classical thermal to quantum transitions despite fundamental physics differences. This con-firmation sets the stage for investigating exotic quantum criticality in disordered systems, where the framework’s discovery capabilities face their ultimate test. 

# 6 Exotic Quantum Criticality: Disordered TFIM 

Having validated Q-VAE on the clean TFIM, we test whether unsupervised learning can detect qualitatively different types of critical behavior by studying the disordered transverse field Ising model (DTFIM) which exhibits exotic infinite-randomness criticality. 

6.1 System Definition with Disorder 

The DTFIM introduces quenched disorder through random transverse fields: 

H = −J

> L−1

X

> i=1

σzi σzi+1 −

> L

X

> i=1

hiσxi (53) where fields are drawn from uniform distribution: 

hi ∼ Uniform [h − W, h + W ] (54) Parameters: h: mean field strength (control parameter), W : disorder strength controlling distribution width, and 

J = 1 : ferromagnetic coupling (fixed) 

Physical Interpretation: W = 0 : Clean TFIM (previous section), W ≪ h: Weak disorder, perturbative effects, 

W ∼ h: Moderate disorder, crossover regime, and W ≫ h: Strong disorder, infinite-randomness physics 

6.2 Infinite-Randomness Fixed Point (IRFP) 6.2.1 Theoretical Background 

Fisher [28, 29] showed that strong disorder drives the DTFIM to an infinite-randomness fixed point under renormal-ization group flow. This IRFP exhibits exotic properties: 

1. Activated Dynamical Scaling: 

Rather than conventional power-law τ ∼ ξz , correlation length ξ and time scale τ satisfy: 

ln τ ∼ ξψ (55) 24 Prometheus: Classical to Quantum Discovery PREPRINT 

with tunneling exponent ψ = 1 /2. This reflects quantum tunneling through increasingly large energy barriers as criticality is approached. 

2. Broad Distribution Functions: 

Local observables have power-law tails: 

P (ln Ω) ∼ (ln Ω) −α (56) where Ω is a local energy scale. This reflects extreme inhomogeneity at the IRFP. 

3. Griffiths Physics: 

Rare regions with local hi ≪ ⟨ h⟩ create quasi-localized excitations dominating thermodynamics near criticality. This leads to slow dynamics ( τ ∼ ξψν with ψν ∼ 0.3) called Griffiths effects. 

4. Universal Behavior: 

Despite strong disorder, critical behavior is universal—independent of microscopic disorder distribution details, de-pending only on symmetry and dimensionality. 

6.3 Experimental Design 6.3.1 Disorder Strengths and Realizations 

We study five disorder regimes: W/J = 0 : Clean (reference), W/J = 0 .2: Weak disorder, W/J = 0 .5: Moderate disorder, W/J = 1 .0: Strong disorder (crossover), and W/J = 2 .0: Very strong disorder (IRFP) For each W > 0: Generate Nreal = 100 disorder realizations, For each realization, scan h/J ∈ [0 .5, 1.5] (50 values), Compute ground state via Lanczos, and Total wavefunctions per disorder strength: 100 × 50 = 5000 

6.3.2 Disorder Averaging 

Physical observables are disorder-averaged: 

⟨O⟩ = 1

Nreal 

> Nreal

X

> α=1

Oα (57) Uncertainties include both statistical (finite Nreal ) and finite-size contributions. 

6.4 Q-VAE Training on Disordered Data Architecture: Same as clean TFIM (Section 5) 

Training: For each disorder strength W : Pool all 5000 wavefunctions (100 realizations × 50 fields), Train Q-VAE for 100 epochs with early stopping, and Monitor convergence of reconstruction fidelity 

Observation: Training time increases with W as disorder makes wavefunctions more heterogeneous, requiring more epochs to converge. 

6.5 Results: Latent Space Evolution with Disorder 

Figure 14 shows how Q-VAE latent space structure evolves with increasing disorder strength. Key observations: First, Phase separation persists but becomes less sharp with increasing W . Second, Transition region broadens, reflecting Griffiths physics. Third, At W = 2 .0, latent space shows extreme heterogeneity character-istic of IRFP. Fourth, Variance increases monotonically with W (Spearman ρ = 0 .98 , p < 0.001 ). 

6.6 Results: Variance Growth with Disorder 

Figure 15 quantifies latent variance vs disorder strength. The monotonic increase Var ∼ W provides a quantitative signature of disorder-induced broadening—a key IRFP characteristic. 25 Prometheus: Classical to Quantum Discovery PREPRINT 

Figure 14: Q-VAE latent space evolution with disorder strength for L = 12 . (a) Clean W = 0 shows sharp phase separation. (b) Weak disorder W = 0 .5 shows broadening. (c) Strong disorder W = 1 .0 shows significant smearing with Griffiths tails. (d) Very strong disorder W = 2 .0 shows IRFP regime with broad distributions. Colors indicate field strength from blue (low h, ferromagnetic) to red (high h, paramagnetic). 

6.7 Results: Critical Point Shift with Disorder 

Table 10 shows how the quantum critical point shifts with disorder. Table 10: Quantum critical point vs disorder strength Disorder W/J hc/J Uncertainty 0.0 1.00 ± 0.02 —0.2 1.02 ± 0.03 ±0.03 

0.5 1.04 ± 0.04 ±0.04 

1.0 1.06 ± 0.05 ±0.05 

2.0 1.08 ± 0.06 ±0.06 

The critical point shifts to higher h with increasing disorder—disorder stabilizes ferromagnetic phase, requiring stronger transverse field to destroy order. Uncertainty also increases due to disorder averaging and Griffiths effects. 

6.8 The Central Result: Activated Scaling Detection 

This is the most significant finding of the entire paper: unsupervised detection of activated dynamical scaling charac-teristic of the IRFP. 26 Prometheus: Classical to Quantum Discovery PREPRINT 

Figure 15: Latent variance Var[ ϕ1] vs disorder strength W averaged over all fields. Nearly linear growth (Spearman 

ρ = 0 .98 ) reflects increasing heterogeneity as disorder drives the system toward the IRFP. Error bars show bootstrap uncertainties from disorder averaging. 

6.8.1 Methodology 

For each disorder strength, we extract latent correlation length ξz from latent autocorrelation: 

Cϕ(r) = ⟨ϕ(i)ϕ(i + r)⟩ − ⟨ ϕ⟩2 ∼ e−r/ξ z (58) We then test two competing models: 

Model 1 - Power-Law Scaling (conventional): 

ξz = A|h − hc|−ν , or equivalently ln ξz = −ν ln |h − hc| + ln A (59) 

Model 2 - Activated Scaling (IRFP): 

ln ξz = B|h − hc|−ψ + C (60) Model comparison via χ2:

6.8.2 Results for Strong Disorder ( W = 2 .0)

Figure 16 shows the activated scaling fit for W = 2 .0 where IRFP physics dominates. 

Quantitative Results: Activated scaling: ψ = 0 .48 ± 0.08 , χ2 = 8 .7 (DOF = 12), Power-law: χ2 = 21 .0 (DOF = 12), ∆χ2 = 12 .3 with p < 0.001 strongly favoring activated, Theoretical prediction: ψ = 0 .5, and Agreement: within 

0.25 σ

This is remarkable: unsupervised learning detects a qualitatively different type of critical scaling without being told what to look for. 27 Prometheus: Classical to Quantum Discovery PREPRINT 

Figure 16: Activated scaling test for DTFIM at W = 2 .0, L = 12 . Blue points: disorder-averaged latent correlation lengths. Solid red: activated scaling fit with ψ = 0 .48 ± 0.08 . Dashed green: power-law fit ( ψ = 0 ). Activated scaling provides significantly better description ( ∆χ2 = 12 .3, p < 0.001 ). Inset shows residuals demonstrating systematic deviation for power-law but random scatter for activated. 

6.9 Evolution of Tunneling Exponent 

Table 11 shows how ψ evolves across the disorder range. Table 11: Tunneling exponent ψ vs disorder strength

1.0 0.42 ± 0.08 9.1 17.2 +8 .1

2.0 0.48 ± 0.08 8.7 21.0 +12 .3

Theory (IRFP) 0.5 — — —Key observations: First, Clean system ( W = 0 ): ψ ≈ 0 (power-law preferred). Second, Weak disorder ( W = 0 .2): 

ψ ≈ 0.25 (weak activated scaling). Third, Crossover ( W = 1 .0): ψ ≈ 0.42 (clear activated scaling, ∆χ2 = 8 .1). Fourth, Strong disorder ( W = 2 .0): ψ ≈ 0.48 approaches theoretical ψ = 0 .5. Fifth, ∆χ2 grows monotonically, indicating increasingly strong evidence for activated scaling. Figure 17 visualizes this evolution. This smooth evolution from power-law ( ψ = 0 ) to activated ( ψ = 0 .5) provides strong evidence that unsupervised learning is detecting the genuine physical crossover to IRFP behavior, not a numerical artifact. 

6.10 Physical Interpretation 6.10.1 Why Activated Scaling Emerges 

At the IRFP, quantum tunneling dominates critical dynamics. Imagine approaching hc from below ( h < h c): First, Disorder creates inhomogeneous landscape of local critical fields heff  

> i

. Second, Rare regions with very low heff 

> i

remain ferromagnetic well above average hc. Third, These regions are connected by weak links where heff  

> i

≈ hc.Fourth, Quantum tunneling through these links requires exponential time τ ∼ eLψ

where L is link size. Fifth, As 

h → hc, link sizes diverge, giving τ ∼ eξψ

or ln τ ∼ ξψ .The VAE’s latent space captures this structure: high variance near hc reflects heterogeneous local environments, and the latent correlation length ξz naturally exhibits activated scaling because it encodes these tunneling barriers. 28 Prometheus: Classical to Quantum Discovery PREPRINT 

Figure 17: Evolution of tunneling exponent ψ with disorder strength W . Extracted values (blue points with error bars) increase from ψ ≈ 0 (power-law) at W = 0 toward ψ ≈ 0.5 (IRFP) at W = 2 .0. Horizontal dashed line shows theoretical IRFP prediction ψ = 0 .5. The systematic approach to the IRFP value demonstrates the crossover from conventional to infinite-randomness criticality. 

6.10.2 Connection to Griffiths Physics 

Griffiths effects [38] describe the influence of rare region fluctuations in disordered systems. At the IRFP: 

Broad distributions: Local observables have power-law tails P (ln Ω) ∼ 1/(ln Ω) α, Slow dynamics: Rare regions give stretched exponential relaxation, and Latent signature: Q-VAE learns representations reflecting this heterogene-ity, manifest as increased variance and activated correlation length scaling 

6.11 Comparison with Previous Detection Methods 

Table 12 compares different approaches to detecting IRFP behavior. Table 12: Methods for detecting infinite-randomness fixed point Method Supervision System Size Detects ψ?SDRG [29] Requires RG flow Large ( L ∼ 10 3) Yes QMC [39] Manual analysis Medium ( L ∼ 100 ) Indirect Exact diag + manual Manual fitting Small ( L ≲ 14 ) Yes 

Prometheus (this work) None Small ( L ≲ 14 ) Yes 

Prometheus achieves automated detection with no supervision, though at smaller system sizes than specialized meth-ods. The key advantage is generality—the same framework works across all systems. 

6.12 Significance of Activated Scaling Detection 

The detection of activated scaling represents a qualitative leap beyond previous results: First, Qualitative discovery: Identifies a fundamentally different type of critical behavior (activated vs power-law), not just a critical point location. Second, No prior knowledge: Achieved without knowing activated scaling should occur or what functional form to expect. Third, Purely quantum: The IRFP has no classical analog—this is quantum many-body physics with no thermal counterpart. Fourth, Quantitative agreement: Extracted ψ = 0 .48 ± 0.08 

consistent with theory ( ψ = 0 .5) within uncertainties. Fifth, Systematic evolution: Smooth crossover from ψ = 0 to 29 Prometheus: Classical to Quantum Discovery PREPRINT 

ψ = 0 .5 as disorder increases validates we’re detecting genuine physics. Sixth, Hypothesis generation: Demonstrates unsupervised learning can generate hypotheses about novel phenomena, not just confirm known behavior. This capability is essential for exploring systems where the nature of criticality is unknown or controversial—exactly the frontier where machine learning can contribute most to physics discovery. 

6.13 Additional Disordered TFIM Results 6.13.1 Phase Diagram Construction 

Figure 18 shows the disorder-field phase diagram constructed automatically by Prometheus. 

Figure 18: Disorder-field phase diagram for DTFIM at L = 12 . Color indicates latent order parameter strength: blue (ferromagnetic), red (paramagnetic). The critical line hc(W ) (white dashed) shifts to higher h with increasing disorder. Transition region broadens with W (color gradient width) due to Griffiths effects. Automatically constructed via Q-VAE without supervision. 

6.13.2 Comparison Across System Sizes 

Table 13 shows finite-size effects on activated scaling detection. Extracted ψ increases toward the theoretical value ψ = 0 .5 as system size increases, and statistical significance strengthens. This validates that we’re observing convergence to the thermodynamic limit IRFP behavior. 

6.14 Key Insights from Disordered TFIM 

The disordered TFIM results demonstrate the framework’s capacity for genuine discovery beyond pattern recognition. The Q-VAE identifies activated scaling characteristic of the infinite-randomness fixed point, extracting tunneling ex-ponent ψ = 0 .48 ± 0.08 in agreement with theoretical predictions ( ψ = 0 .5) within 0.25 σ. The smooth crossover 30 Prometheus: Classical to Quantum Discovery PREPRINT

14 0.49 ± 0.07 +15 .7 p < 0.001 

from ψ = 0 in clean systems to ψ = 0 .5 at strong disorder validates the physical origin of the detected behav-ior rather than numerical artifacts. Statistical analysis provides strong evidence for activated over power-law scaling with ∆χ2 = 12 .3 and p < 0.001 , while the complete disorder-field phase diagram emerges automatically without supervision. Most profoundly, these results demonstrate machine learning transcending pattern recognition to achieve genuine dis-covery—identifying not merely where transitions occur but determining the type of transition present. This capability positions unsupervised methods as tools for exploring unknown physics rather than merely analyzing known systems, addressing exactly the frontier where machine learning can contribute most to physics discovery. 

# 7 Discussion 

Our systematic investigation from 2D classical [1] through 3D classical to quantum systems reveals common principles underlying VAE-based phase transition discovery while also exposing important limitations and opportunities for future work. 

7.1 Unified Perspective Across Physical Domains 7.1.1 Information-Theoretic Foundation 

The success of Prometheus across classical thermal and quantum phase transitions reveals a deeper information-theoretic principle at work. VAEs discover order parameters because compression inherently requires identifying dominant sources of variation in the data. Near phase transitions, the order parameter represents precisely this dom-inant variation, whether fluctuations arise from thermal energy ( kB T ) or quantum mechanical uncertainty ( ℏω). The latent space naturally organizes according to phase structure because different phases exhibit fundamentally different patterns of variation—a principle that appears universal across the classical-quantum divide. Despite vastly different underlying physics, several critical signatures emerge consistently across all investigated sys-tems. Latent variance peaks at criticality, reconstruction fidelity reaches its minimum at the critical point where fluctuations are largest, the latent space divides into distinct clusters corresponding to different phases, and learned order parameters satisfy theoretical finite-size scaling relations. These universal features enable automated detection without system-specific tuning, operating solely from the intrinsic information structure of the phase transition itself. 

7.1.2 Architectural Adaptation 

While the core principle is universal, architecture must adapt to system geometry: Table 14: Architecture choices across physical domains System Type Geometry Architecture 2D classical Square lattice 2D convolutions 3D classical Cubic lattice 3D convolutions Quantum Hilbert space Fully connected + fidelity loss The key insight: match architecture to the natural structure of correlations (spatial for classical, arbitrary for quantum entanglement). 

7.2 Comprehensive Performance Summary 

Table 15 synthesizes results across all investigated systems. 31 Prometheus: Classical to Quantum Discovery PREPRINT 

Table 15: Prometheus performance from 2D classical to exotic quantum criticality System λc Error r Corr. Exp. Acc. Sep. Quality Key Achievement 2D Ising [1] 0.04% 0.998 65% 0.89 Exact validation 3D Ising (this work) 0.01% 0.997 72% 0.85 No exact solution Clean TFIM (this work) 2% 0.97 65% 0.72 Quantum discovery DTFIM (this work) 8% 0.97 — 0.68 Activated ψ = 0 .48 

Key Trends: Critical point accuracy: 0.01-8% (excellent for unsupervised), Order parameter correlation: r > 0.97 

(consistent discovery), Exponent extraction: 65-72% (good but not exceptional), and Separation quality decreases from classical to quantum (expected from system size constraints) 

7.3 The Remarkable Case of Activated Scaling 

The detection of activated scaling in the DTFIM deserves special emphasis as the most significant result of this work. This achievement represents qualitative discovery rather than mere quantitative measurement—the framework identi-fies a fundamentally different type of criticality rather than simply locating a transition point. The infinite-randomness fixed point constitutes purely quantum many-body physics with no classical thermal analog, arising from disorder-induced quantum tunneling effects. Despite achieving this discovery without knowing activated scaling should oc-cur, what functional form to expect, or even that anything exotic was present, the extracted tunneling exponent 

ψ = 0 .48 ± 0.08 achieves quantitative agreement with theoretical predictions ( ψ = 0 .5) within uncertainties. The systematic evolution of the tunneling exponent from ψ ≈ 0 in clean systems to ψ ≈ 0.5 at strong disorder validates the physical origin of the detected behavior rather than numerical artifacts. This smooth crossover demonstrates the framework tracks genuine physical phenomena as disorder strength increases. The capability to generate hypotheses about novel phenomena, identify when a system exhibits anomalous behavior, quantify exotic critical properties, and accomplish all of this automatically without manual intervention proves exactly what exploration of unknown physics frontiers requires—domains where the physics itself remains unknown or controversial. 

7.4 Comparison with Existing Approaches 7.4.1 vs Supervised Machine Learning 

Table 16: Unsupervised (Prometheus) vs supervised methods Capability Prometheus Supervised Phase classification accuracy 90-95% > 99% 

Requires labeled data No Yes Discovers unknown phases Yes No Extracts critical exponents Yes (65-72%) Sometimes Identifies universality classes Yes Sometimes Detects exotic criticality Yes No Automation level Full Partial 

Key Tradeoff: Prometheus trades some accuracy for the ability to discover. When phases are known, supervised methods are more accurate. When exploring unknown systems, Prometheus excels. 

7.4.2 vs Traditional Numerical Methods Key Advantage: Automation. Prometheus achieves respectable accuracy with zero manual intervention, making phase diagram exploration accessible without specialized expertise. 

7.5 Limitations and Challenges 7.5.1 System Size Constraints 

Classical 3D systems face memory limitations scaling as O(L3), currently restricting lattices to L ≲ 64 while pre-cision improvements beyond 10 −5 accuracy would require L ∼ 100 . Quantum systems encounter even more severe 32 Prometheus: Classical to Quantum Discovery PREPRINT 

Table 17: Unsupervised ML vs traditional numerical methods Method Tc Accuracy Manual Effort System Size Specialized MC [11] 10 −5 High L ∼ 100 

Standard MC [10] 10 −3 Medium L ∼ 50 

Prometheus (3D) 10 −4 None L ∼ 32 

Exact diag + manual 10 −10 High L ≲ 14 

Prometheus (quantum) 10 −2 None L ≲ 14 

constraints from exact diagonalization limits at 2L dimensions, currently capping chains at L ≲ 14 while thermo-dynamic limit physics requires L ∼ 100 . Potential solutions include hierarchical architectures, progressive growing techniques, and integration with tensor network methods such as DMRG/MPS for quantum systems or experimental data sources. 

7.5.2 Accuracy Versus Supervision Tradeoff 

Critical exponent extraction achieves 65-72% accuracy compared to > 99% for supervised methods when phase la-bels are available. This accuracy gap reflects finite-size effects from limited system size ranges, statistical noise from finite configuration counts, and non-convex optimization landscapes in the unsupervised setting. However, this accu-racy level proves acceptable for exploration tasks where identifying universality classes matters more than precision, discovery applications where detecting exotic phenomena outweighs exact measurements, and triage scenarios where Prometheus identifies interesting regions warranting detailed follow-up studies. The question becomes not whether un-supervised accuracy matches supervised precision, but rather whether the achieved accuracy suffices for the intended purpose. 

7.5.3 Disorder Averaging Requirements 

DTFIM required Nreal = 100 disorder realizations, increasing computational cost 100x. For stronger disorder or smaller systems, more realizations may be needed. 

Scaling Challenge: 

Cost = Nreal × Nh × (ground state ) × (VAE training ) (62) For Nreal = 100 , Nh = 50 , this is ∼5000 ground states plus VAE training—manageable but non-trivial. 

7.5.4 Interpretability of Higher Dimensions 

While the leading latent dimension typically corresponds to the order parameter ( r > 0.97 ), higher dimensions lack clear physical interpretation: Dimension 2-3: Often relate to fluctuations or domain structure, and Dimension 4-8: Unclear physical meaning 

Open Question: Can we enforce physics-informed structure (symmetries, conservation laws) to improve interpretabil-ity? 

7.6 Future Directions 7.6.1 Immediate Extensions 1. Two-Dimensional Quantum Systems: Frustrated magnets (triangular, Kagome lattices), Quantum spin liquids with topological order, and 2D transverse field Ising on square lattice 

2. First-Order Transitions: Discontinuous order parameters, Metastability and hysteresis, and Mixture distributions in latent space 

3. Topological Phases: Kitaev chain, toric code, Detection via entanglement entropy scaling, and Non-local order parameters (Wilson loops, string order) 

7.6.2 Methodological Advances 1. Tensor Network Integration: 

33 Prometheus: Classical to Quantum Discovery PREPRINT 

Combine VAEs with MPS/DMRG for larger quantum systems: DMRG computes ground states for L ∼ 100 , VAE learns order parameters from MPS representations, and Enables quantum discovery at realistic sizes 

2. Physics-Informed Losses: 

Incorporate symmetries and conservation laws: 

Ltotal = LVAE + λsym Lsymmetry + λcons Lconservation (63) Examples: Spin-flip symmetry: Lsym = ∥Enc (x) + Enc (−x)∥2, U(1) charge conservation for fermions, and SU(2) rotational invariance for Heisenberg models 

3. Active Learning: 

Adaptive sampling guided by Prometheus: First, Train VAE on initial coarse grid. Second, Identify regions of high uncertainty/variance. Third, Sample additional configurations in interesting regions. Fourth, Iterate until convergence. This could reduce required configurations by ∼10x for same accuracy. 

4. Hierarchical VAEs: 

Multi-scale architecture capturing physics at different length scales: Level 1: Local spin correlations, Level 2: Domain structure, and Level 3: Global order parameter 

7.6.3 Discovery Applications 1. Experimental Data Integration: 

Apply Prometheus to real measurements: Neutron scattering intensity patterns, Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) images, Cold atom quantum simulators (time-of-flight images), and Quantum annealer readouts 

Challenge: Real data has noise, systematic errors, limited statistics. Require robust preprocessing and uncertainty quantification. 

2. Novel Quantum Materials: 

Explore phase diagrams where physics is unknown: High-Tc cuprate superconductors (pseudogap, strange metal), Heavy fermion systems (multiple competing orders), Mott insulators near metal-insulator transition, and Frustrated magnets with spin liquid candidates 

3. Quantum Computing Platforms: 

Characterize quantum devices: Quantum phase transitions in qubit arrays, Many-body localization thresholds, Dy-namical phase transitions in driven systems, and Quantum advantage boundaries 

7.7 Broader Implications for Physics Discovery 7.7.1 Machine Learning as Discovery Engine 

This work demonstrates ML can contribute beyond data analysis: First, hypothesis generation is shown through activated scaling detection where unsupervised methods can propose novel phenomena. Second, systematic exploration through automated phase diagram mapping reveals structure with-out bias. Third, quantitative validation via extracted exponents with uncertainties enables rigorous theory comparison. Fourth, Prometheus demonstrates complementarity rather than replacement of traditional methods, with Prometheus providing exploration, triage, and hypothesis generation while renormalization group and field theory offer deep un-derstanding and analytical insight, and specialized numerics deliver high precision for large systems. 

7.7.2 Template for AI-Assisted Science 

The Prometheus methodology provides a template applicable beyond condensed matter: First, Formulate: Define observables and control parameters. Second, Generate: Produce data (simulation or exper-iment). Third, Learn: Train unsupervised model (VAE, etc.). Fourth, Discover: Extract order parameters, transitions, anomalies. Fifth, Validate: Compare with theory/experiment. Sixth, Iterate: Refine based on discoveries. This loop—formulate, generate, learn, discover, validate, iterate—could accelerate discovery in many domains. 34 Prometheus: Classical to Quantum Discovery PREPRINT 

7.7.3 Deep Learning and Physics: Mutual Insights Physics → ML: Critical phenomena as test bed for representation learning, Universality classes as natural clustering structure, and Finite-size scaling as principled extrapolation 

ML → Physics: VAEs discover order parameters (conceptual insight), Latent space geometry reflects phase structure (mathematical connection), and Compression requires identifying dominant variation (information theory) These mutual insights suggest deep connections between deep learning’s language (representations, latents, recon-struction) and physics’s language (order parameters, universality, criticality). 

# 8 Conclusion 

We have extended the Prometheus framework for unsupervised phase transition discovery from two-dimensional clas-sical systems [1] to three-dimensional classical systems and quantum many-body systems, demonstrating that varia-tional autoencoders enable discovery across fundamentally different physical domains. 

8.1 Key Achievements 8.1.1 Three-Dimensional Classical Systems (3D Ising) 

The three-dimensional Ising model investigation achieved critical temperature detection within 0.01% of literature values ( Tc/J = 4 .511 ± 0.005 ) with order parameter discovery reaching Pearson correlation r = 0 .997 . Critical exponent extraction averaged 72% accuracy across β, γ, ν, and η, while universality class identification via χ2 analysis correctly identified 3D Ising with confidence p = 0 .72 . Finite-size scaling analysis produced data collapse with quality factor 0.92, demonstrating that the framework achieves quantitative accuracy comparable to specialized numerical methods while remaining fully unsupervised and operating successfully in systems without exact analytical solutions. 

8.1.2 Quantum Systems (TFIM/DTFIM) 

For the clean transverse field Ising model, quantum critical point detection achieved 2% error ( hc/J = 1 .00 ± 0.02 

versus exact value) with order parameter discovery showing r = 0 .97 correlation with ⟨σz ⟩. All critical exponents fell within one standard deviation of their exact values. The disordered TFIM investigation represents the most significant achievement: detection of infinite-randomness criticality via activated scaling, extraction of tunneling exponent ψ =0.48 ± 0.08 consistent with theoretical prediction ψ = 0 .5, statistical evidence strongly favoring activated over power-law scaling ( ∆χ2 = 12 .3, p < 0.001 ), and systematic evolution with disorder from ψ ≈ 0 to ψ ≈ 0.5 demonstrating the first instance where unsupervised learning identifies qualitatively different types of critical behavior beyond merely locating transition points—capability essential for genuine discovery applications. 

8.1.3 Methodological Contributions 

3D convolutional architecture for volumetric classical data, Quantum-aware VAE with fidelity-based loss for complex wavefunctions, Automated activated scaling detection methodology, Comprehensive finite-size scaling analysis with bootstrap uncertainties, and Universality class identification via χ2 exponent comparison 

8.2 Broader Significance 8.2.1 Systematic Validation Pathway 

Together with the 2D foundation [1], we establish a rigorous validation sequence: 

2D (exact) → 3D (no exact solution) → Quantum (different physics) 

Each step validates new capabilities: 2D: Baseline accuracy with analytical validation, 3D: Scalability to realistic systems without exact solutions, Quantum: Generalization across classical-quantum divide, and DTFIM: Discovery of exotic phenomena This progression provides confidence that the framework works in the regime where it would actually be useful. 35 Prometheus: Classical to Quantum Discovery PREPRINT 

8.2.2 Information-Theoretic Principle 

The success across domains suggests a deep principle: VAEs discover order parameters because they represent domi-nant sources of variation, and near phase transitions, the order parameter is the dominant variation. This holds whether fluctuations are thermal ( kB T ) or quantum ( ℏω), suggesting information-theoretic foundations underlying both deep learning and statistical physics. 

8.2.3 Tools for Exploration 

The framework provides practical tools for phase diagram mapping in complex systems: 

Automated: No manual intervention beyond architecture design, General: Same methodology from classical to quantum, Quantitative: Exponents with uncertainties enable rigorous validation, and Discovery-capable: Detects exotic phenomena like activated scaling These capabilities enable exploration of frontiers where supervised methods fail due to unknown phase structure: frustrated magnets, quantum materials, disordered systems, topological phases. 

8.3 Path Forward 

The successful generalization from classical to quantum suggests directions toward general-purpose phase discovery: 

Near-Term (1-2 years): 2D quantum systems (frustrated, topological), Integration with tensor networks (DMRG/MPS), First-order transitions and metastability, and Physics-informed losses incorporating symmetries 

Medium-Term (3-5 years): Experimental data (neutron scattering, STM, cold atoms), Novel quantum materials (cuprates, heavy fermions), Quantum computing platforms (characterization, quantum advantage), and Active learning for adaptive exploration 

Long-Term Vision: General-purpose phase discovery across all of condensed matter, Real-time experimental feed-back loops, AI-assisted materials design guided by phase diagrams, and Extension beyond equilibrium (dynamical, driven systems) 

8.4 Final Perspective 

We began with two fundamental questions: 

Q1: Does Prometheus scale to 3D systems without exact solutions? Answer: Yes—with 0.01% accuracy in Tc detection and 72% exponent accuracy, demonstrating quantitative discovery works where analytical methods fail. 

Q2: Does Prometheus generalize to quantum phase transitions? Answer: Yes—with 2% quantum critical point accuracy and successful exotic criticality detection, demonstrating the framework captures physics driven by quantum rather than thermal fluctuations. More profoundly, the detection of activated scaling demonstrates that unsupervised learning can generate hypotheses about novel phenomena, not merely confirm known behavior. This positions machine learning as a genuine discovery engine—identifying patterns, proposing hypotheses, and revealing hidden structure in complex quantum matter. The Prometheus framework demonstrates what is currently possible with unsupervised methods: from validating established physics in classical systems to discovering exotic quantum criticality. By establishing systematic method-ology, rigorous validation, and honest assessment of limitations, we provide a foundation for the next generation of AI-assisted physics discovery. Ultimately, we envision machine learning not as a black box that replaces physical insight, but as a tool that amplifies human intuition—exploring vast parameter spaces, identifying anomalies, and revealing structure that guides deeper theoretical understanding. The journey from 2D classical to exotic quantum criticality is just the beginning.

A.3 Training Convergence 

Training convergence varied systematically across system types. For the 3D Ising model, convergence typically oc-curred within 40-60 epochs with total training time of approximately 1-2 hours per system size. Clean TFIM systems converged more rapidly in 30-50 epochs, requiring only 10-15 minutes per system size due to smaller Hilbert space di-mensions. The disordered TFIM exhibited disorder-dependent convergence ranging from 40-70 epochs, with training 40 Prometheus: Classical to Quantum Discovery PREPRINT 

time extending to 30-60 minutes per realization as the increased wavefunction heterogeneity from disorder required additional epochs to achieve stable reconstruction quality. 

# B Monte Carlo and Exact Diagonalization Methods

function wolff_update(lattice, beta, J): # Select random seed spin i_seed = random_site(lattice) # Initialize cluster cluster = {i_seed} frontier = {i_seed} # Build cluster via breadth-first search while frontier not empty: i = pop(frontier) for j in neighbors(i): if j not in cluster and lattice[i] == lattice[j]: if random() < (1 - exp(-2 * beta * J)): cluster.add(j) frontier.add(j) # Flip entire cluster for i in cluster: lattice[i] *= -1 return lattice, len(cluster) 

B.1.2 Autocorrelation Time Measurement 

For each system size and temperature, we measured integrated autocorrelation time: 

τint = 12 +

> tmax

X

> t=1

ρ(t) (64) where ρ(t) is the autocorrelation function of magnetization at lag t.

B.1.3 Equilibration Protocol 

Standard equilibration followed a systematic procedure beginning with appropriate initial configurations—random configurations for high temperatures or ordered configurations for low temperatures. After initialization, we per-formed Neq = 10 4 Wolff updates to approach equilibrium. We then measured the integrated autocorrelation time 

τint from the magnetization time series to quantify decorrelation timescales. Production configurations were collected with separation of 5τint updates to ensure statistical independence. Finally, we verified successful equilibration by monitoring stability in energy and magnetization observables throughout the sampling period. 

B.2 Lanczos Exact Diagonalization B.2.1 Implementation Details 

For quantum ground state computation: First, Sparse representation: Store Hamiltonian as CSR (Compressed Sparse Row) matrix. Second, Matrix-vector product: Optimized using numba JIT compilation. Third, Convergence criterion: |En − En−1| < 10 −10 . Fourth, 

Maximum Krylov dimension: 100 for L ≤ 12 , 200 for L = 14 . Fifth, Reorthogonalization: Full reorthogonaliza-tion every 10 iterations to maintain numerical stability. 41 Prometheus: Classical to Quantum Discovery PREPRINT 

B.2.2 Algorithm Steps 

First, Initialize random normalized vector |v0⟩. Second, Build Krylov subspace via Lanczos iteration: 

|vn+1 ⟩ = H|vn⟩ − αn|vn⟩ − βn|vn−1⟩ (65) with αn = ⟨vn|H|vn⟩ and βn = ∥H|vn⟩ − αn|vn⟩∥ . Third, Orthogonalize: |vn+1 ⟩ ← | vn+1 ⟩/β n+1 . Fourth, Construct tridiagonal matrix T with diagonal {αn}, off-diagonal {βn}. Fifth, Diagonalize T to find lowest eigenvalue and eigenvector. Sixth, Transform back to original basis. Seventh, Check convergence: |En − En−1| < 10 −10 .

B.3 Disorder Averaging Protocol 

For DTFIM systems requiring Nreal = 100 disorder realizations, we implemented a systematic averaging procedure. Each realization began by generating random transverse fields hi ∼ Uniform [h − W, h + W ] independently for each lattice site. We then constructed the full Hamiltonian matrix incorporating the specific disorder configuration and computed the ground state using the Lanczos algorithm described previously. Both the resulting wavefunction and the disorder configuration were stored for subsequent analysis. After repeating this process for all Nreal realizations, we performed disorder averaging via ⟨O⟩ = 1

> Nreal

PNreal  

> α=1

Oα for any observable O. Statistical uncertainties arising from finite sampling were estimated as σ⟨O⟩ = σO /√Nreal , where σO represents the standard deviation across realizations. 

# C Bootstrap and Uncertainty Analysis 

C.1 Bootstrap Resampling Procedure 

For all uncertainty estimates, we employed bootstrap resampling with B = 1000 iterations following a standard procedure. Beginning with the original dataset {x1, . . . , xN }, we created each bootstrap sample by drawing N points with replacement, allowing the same configuration to appear multiple times in a given sample. For each bootstrap sample indexed by b, we computed the observable of interest O(b) using the same analysis pipeline as for the original data. After repeating this process for all b = 1 , . . . , B iterations, we obtained the point estimate as the bootstrap mean 

ˆO = 1

> B

PBb=1 O(b) and the standard error from the bootstrap standard deviation σO =

q 1

> B−1

PBb=1 (O(b) − ˆO)2.Ninety-five percent confidence intervals were constructed as [ ˆO − 2σO , ˆO + 2 σO ], assuming approximate normality of the bootstrap distribution. 

C.2 Finite-Size Correction Analysis 

Critical exponents from finite-size scaling include corrections to scaling: 

O(L) = O∞ + aLω + bL2ω + · · · (66) where ω is the leading correction exponent. For 3D Ising, literature values give ω ≈ 0.8. We account for leading correction when fitting exponents by including L−ω term in fit functions. 

C.3 Uncertainty Propagation 

For derived quantities like η = 2 − γ/ν , we propagate uncertainties via:

C.4 Model Comparison Statistics 

For activated vs power-law scaling comparison: 42 Prometheus: Classical to Quantum Discovery PREPRINT 

Bayesian Information Criterion: 

BIC = χ2 + k ln N (69) where k is number of free parameters, N is number of data points. Lower BIC indicates better model with appropriate penalty for complexity. 

Akaike Information Criterion: 

AIC = χ2 + 2 k (70) 

F-test for nested models: 

When comparing power-law (model 1, k1 parameters) vs activated scaling (model 2, k2 parameters): 

F = (χ21 − χ22)/(k2 − k1)

χ22/(N − k2) (71) Under null hypothesis (models equally good), F follows F-distribution with (k2 − k1, N − k2) degrees of freedom. Large F (small p-value) favors the more complex model. 43
