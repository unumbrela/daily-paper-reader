Abstract 

Triple-based Iterative Retrieval-Augmented Generation (iRAG) mitigates document-level noise for multi-hop question answering. How-ever, existing methods still face limitations: (i) greedy single-path expansion , which propagates early errors and fails to capture parallel evidence from different reasoning branches, and (ii) granularity-demand mis-match , where a single evidence representation struggles to balance noise control with contex-tual sufficiency. In this paper, we propose the Construction-Integration Retrieval and Adap-tive Generation model, CIRAG . It introduces an Iterative Construction-Integration module that constructs candidate triples and history-conditionally integrates them to distill core triples and generate the next-hop query. This module mitigates the greedy trap by preserv-ing multiple plausible evidence chains. Be-sides, we propose an Adaptive Cascaded Multi-Granularity Generation module that progres-sively expands contextual evidence based on the problem requirements, from triples to sup-porting sentences and full passages. Moreover, we introduce Trajectory Distillation, which dis-tills the teacher model’s integration policy into a lightweight student, enabling efficient and reliable long-horizon reasoning. Extensive ex-periments demonstrate that CIRAG achieves su-perior performance compared to existing iRAG methods. 

1 Introduction 

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) excels in simple queries (Lewis et al., 2020; Lin et al., 2024; Ram et al., 2023) but struggles with multi-hop reasoning (Trivedi et al., 2023; Fan et al., 2024; Mallen et al., 2023), as single-step retrieval often fails to gather interconnected evidence (Shao et al., 2023).

Asai et al., 2024; Yao et al., 2024) is introduced by retrieving information in multiple steps. How-ever, existing iRAG methods, whether retrieving full documents (Zhao et al., 2021) or generating chain-of-thoughts (Trivedi et al., 2023), often ac-cumulate irrelevant noise (Yoran et al., 2024) or factual hallucinations during iterations (Wang et al., 2023; Luo et al., 2024), which ultimately degrades reasoning reliability. To mitigate this issue, recent research has piv-oted towards triple-based retrieval (Fang et al., 2025, 2024; Zhang et al., 2025). By using struc-tured knowledge triples as retrieval units, these methods aim to achieve a more focused and re-liable retrieval process. Despite these advances, current triple-based paradigms face two critical limitations, as illustrated in Figure 1. The first challenge is the Greedy Single-Path Expansion 

in retrieval. Existing methods predominantly se-lect only the single best triple at each step (Fang et al., 2024, 2025). This linear strategy is inher-ently fragile: minor errors in early decisions can rapidly propagate and compound (Jiapeng et al., 2024; Shi et al., 2023; Lee et al., 2022). More-over, by committing to a single path, it overlooks parallel evidence that is often essential for answer-ing complex queries, resulting in incomplete or fragmented reasoning chains (Zhang et al., 2024). The second challenge is the Granularity-Demand

Mismatch . Current paradigms typically adopt a static evidence representation, failing to account for the heterogeneous information needs of differ-ent questions (Fang et al., 2024, 2025). For simple, relation-centric queries, retrieving full documents introduces substantial noise compared to concise triples. Conversely, for complex reasoning tasks that require rich contextual information, structured triples often discard crucial context (Wang and Han, 2025), omitting linguistic nuances that are naturally preserved in passages. As a result, a fixed retrieval granularity is insufficient to meet the diverse rea-soning requirements posed by different queries. To address these challenges, we draw inspiration from Construction-Integration (CI) model in cog-nitive psychology (Kintsch and Van Dijk, 1978). CI characterizes human comprehension as a two-stage process. In Construction, semantic units are broadly activated, and in the Integration stage, con-textual constraints suppress irrelevant activations to yield a coherent semantic network. Grounded in CI, we propose the Construction-Integration Re-trieval and Adaptive Generation model, CIRAG ,consisting of the Iterative Construction-Integration (ICI) Retrieval module and the Adaptive Cascaded Multi-Granularity Knowledge-Enhanced Genera-tion (ACMG) module. Specifically, ICI instantiates CI for iterative re-trieval to mitigate greedy single-path expansion. At each iteration, the construction phase activates can-didate triples extracted from retrieved documents, while the Integration phase enforces global con-straints from the accumulated history to suppress noisy or off-path candidates, yielding a core triple set. Based on the uncovered knowledge gap, the integrator further synthesizes the next-hop query to continue the CI loop. By repeatedly alternating between construction and integration, ICI retains the coherent evidence network and reduces single-path bias. ACMG tackles the granularity-demand mismatch via dynamically expanding context, be-ginning with compact triples and escalating to sup-porting sentences or passages only when required, balancing noise control with contextual complete-ness. To ensure the core advantages of CIRAG are preserved even in smaller-scale models, we introduce Trajectory Distillation, which transfers integration trajectories from a strong teacher model to a lightweight student, enabling robust multi-step integration with reduced computational overhead. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: • Inspired by the CI model, we propose CIRAG, which effectively addresses the challenges of greedy retrieval bias and mismatched granularity requirements in multi-hop reasoning by synergis-tically combining ICI and ACMG modules. • We propose Trajectory Distillation to transfer in-tegration trajectories from a teacher to an efficient student model, ensuring reasoning capabilities with reduced computational overhead. • Extensive experiments on multiple multi-hop and single-hop QA benchmarks validate the effective-ness of CIRAG.

2.1 Text-based iRAG 

The current iRAG methods primarily retrieve rele-vant text passages from the corpus at each retrieval, providing context for LLM generation. IRCoT (Trivedi et al., 2023) and Iter-RetGen (Shao et al., 2023) dynamically generate sub-queries, retrieve relevant documents, and iteratively refine the rea-soning trajectory throughout the generation process. FLARE (Jiang et al., 2023) focuses on adaptively retrieving documents when low-probability tokens are generated. MetaRAG (Zhou et al., 2024) first generates heuristic answers based on the question and the retrieved documents, and then refines them through retrieval. DualRAG (Cheng et al., 2025) guides retrieval through reason-driven query gen-eration and integrates multi-round retrieval docu-ments with an entity-centric approach. These mod-els perform iterative retrieval by progressively aug-menting the query with previously retrieved doc-uments (Zhao et al., 2021; Trivedi et al., 2023). However, retrieved documents often include noise or irrelevant information (Yoran et al., 2024). The propagation of these distracting contexts can de-grade retrieval quality and ultimately hinder overall RAG performance. 

2.2 Triple-based iRAG 

To reduce the impact of noise in documents, the triple-based iterative RAG method improves re-trieval granularity by using knowledge triples dur-ing the retrieval process (Jimenez Gutierrez et al., 2024; Gutiérrez et al., 2025; Li et al., 2025). Ki-RAG (Fang et al., 2025) decomposes documents into structured triples and gradually expands the knowledge chain composed of triples during it-erative retrieval, thereby accurately locating the key information missing in multi-hop question an-swering. TeaRAG (Zhang et al., 2025) employs a triple-enhanced iterative retrieval strategy, simulta-neously retrieving text blocks and pre-built triples in each iteration. However, existing methods face two challenges: the Greedy Single-Path Expansion and the Granularity-Demand Mismatch. Unlike ex-isting methods, our approach addresses these chal-lenges by obtaining a core set of triples through integration based on historical information in each iteration, and then cascadingly expanding the con-text to match the most appropriate granularity of information for each question. 

3 CIRAG 

3.1 Problem Formulation 

We formally define the RAG task: given a user question x and a large-scale document corpus 

D = {di}Ni=1 , the objective of a RAG system is to generate an accurate answer ˆa by retrieving and leveraging relevant documents from D.

3.2 Overview 

As illustrated in Figure 2, we propose CIRAG ,a two-module framework comprising Iterative Construction-Integration (ICI) and Adaptive Cas-caded Multi-Granularity Knowledge-Enhanced Generation (ACMG). ICI retrieval module, re-trieves the core triples set through two iterative phases: construction phase and integration phase. 

ACMG module generates the final answer by se-lecting the most appropriate information for the question through an adaptive cascading method. 

3.3 Iterative Construction-Integration Construction Phase. In the t iteration of ICI (see 1.1 in Figure 2), the retriever R retrieves the top-K

documents most relevant to the current query at,forming a document set Dt = {djt }Kj=1 . These doc-uments constitute the discourse context and are seg-mented into a unified sentence set St = {skt }Mk=1 .Leveraging a prompt-based approach, for each doc-ument in Dt, we employ LLM to identify enti-ties as intermediate anchors, directly guiding the extraction of relational triples(Edge et al., 2024; Fang et al., 2024). The prompt is provided in Appendix A.1. The retriever R as the reranker first ranks the triples by calculating their seman-tic similarity to the current query at. The top-N

of each triple by constructing two mapping sets: 

MD

: [ Q] → [K] and MS 

> t

: [ Q] → [M ], where 

MD 

> t

(i) = j and MS 

> t

(i) = k indicate that triple τ it

is extracted from document djt and sentence skt .

Integration Phase. In the integration phase of iteration t (see 1.2 in Figure 2), we employ a dis-criminative model KD to filter candidate triples and generate the next query. In this phase, the model as-sesses the alignment of candidates with the current query at, while strictly anchoring to the original question x to maintain global consistency. Simul-taneously, it synthesizes the historical context to identify information gaps to formulate a targeted query for the next iteration. To empower KD with the capability to execute this complex dynamic rea-soning, we optimize it via Trajectory Distillation 

(detailed in Sec. 3.5). Given the original question x,the initial candidate set ˆT1, an instruction prompt I

provided in Appendix A.2, and the historical con-text H<t , KD produces (i) a reasoning trace rt, (ii) a filtered core triple set ˜Tt, and (iii) the next-round query at+1 :

(rt, ˜Tt, a t+1 ) = KD(x, ˆT1, I, H<t ). (1) The historical context H<t encapsulates the rea-soning trajectory of previous iterations, including the model output of each round and the correspond-ing candidate triples. Specifically, for H<1 = ∅,for t > 1, it is defined as: 

H<t = (ri, ˜Ti, a i+1 , ˆTi+1 ) t−1

> i=1

. (2) The core triple set ˜Tt retains only salient infor-mation pertinent to the query. To facilitate multi-granularity reasoning, we project these triples back to their source contexts via the provenance map-pings, deriving the core sentence set ˜St and docu-ment set ˜Dt:

˜St = {sk ∈ S t | (i, k ) ∈ M S 

> t

, τ i ∈ ˜Tt}, (3) 

˜Dt = {dj ∈ D t | (i, j ) ∈ M D 

> t

, τ i ∈ ˜Tt}. (4) Finally, we update the cumulative triple set C,cumulative sentence set S, and cumulative docu-ment set D via the incremental updates C ← C∪ ˜Tt,

S ← S ∪ ˜St, and D ← D ∪ ˜Dt. Together, these accumulated sets {C, S, D} constitute the multi-granularity context for cascaded generation. This iterative process terminates when at+1 = ∅

or the maximum iteration step L is reached. Oth-erwise, at+1 triggers the retriever to initiate the Retrieval

Figure 2: Overview of CIRAG. At each iteration, it employs an Iterative Construction-Integration (ICI) Retrieval module to retrieve a core triple set and record provenance links to their supporting sentences and documents, including two iterative phases: construction phase and integration phase. The core triple set is used to produce the final answer via the Adaptive Cascaded Multi-Granularity Knowledge-Enhanced Generation (ACMG) module. 

construction phase at round t+1 . Through this cycle, the system progressively narrows the re-trieval space while integrating verified knowledge for multi-hop reasoning. 

3.4 Adaptive Cascaded Multi-Granularity Knowledge Augmented Generation 

To fully leverage the complementary advantages of different granularities of knowledge in multi-hop question answering, we analyze their trade-offs in semantic expressiveness and noise control. Triples have clear structures and minimal noise, but of-ten lack contextual information. Sentences enrich these triples through local context, thereby improv-ing semantic integrity, but inevitably introducing some irrelevant information. Documents provide the most comprehensive global context, but have the most background noise. Existing approaches typically rely on a single granularity of evidence, making it difficult to balance semantic complete-ness and noise control. To address this, we propose the Adaptive Cas-caded Multi-Granularity Augmented Generation (ACMG) module (see 2 in Figure 2). We define the hierarchy of context granularities as an ordered sequence G = ( gC, g S, g D), where the precedence relation ≺, i.e., gC ≺ gS ≺ gD, denotes an increas-ing order of both semantic coverage and potential noise. This ordering allows the framework to pri-oritize high-precision, low-noise evidence and es-calate to more exhaustive contexts only when the current level is insufficient. Formally, for each granularity g ∈ G , the model generates a response a(g) based on the question x,the corresponding context C(g), and a sufficiency instruction I(g) provided in Appendix A.3. This instruction directs the model MR to evaluate the ad-equacy of C(g) relative to x. It produces a valid an-swer if the information is sufficient, or a predefined refusal response (e.g., Unanswerable) otherwise: 

a(g) = M R



x, C (g), I (g)

(5) where C(g) is the granularity-specific context se-lected from the accumulated pools {C, S, D} ac-cording to g ∈ G .To identify the minimal sufficient granularity, we define a sufficiency indicator Suf( a) ∈ { 0, 1}

that checks whether the model answer a is a refusal. Specifically, Suf( a) = 0 if a matches a predefined refusal template, and Suf( a) = 1 otherwise. The system executes a cascaded search strictly follow-ing the precedence defined in G, selecting the most concise yet sufficient granularity: 

g⋆ = min 

> ≺

n

g ∈ G | Suf  a(g) = 1 

o

. (6) The final output is the answer a(g⋆) from the first level that satisfies the sufficiency condition. If no level provides a sufficient answer, the system de-faults to a(gDOC ) to maximize answerability. 

3.5 Trajectory Distillation 

CIRAG is compatible with LLMs of different pa-rameter scales. However, the Integration Phase is non-trivial: at each iteration, the model must (i) filter noisy candidate triples ( ˆTt → ˜Tt) and (ii) syn-thesize a strategic next-hop query ( at+1 ), both con-ditioned on the accumulated history from previous iterations. Large LLMs are generally more reli-able at maintaining such long-horizon consistency, but invoking them in an interactive loop incurs substantial computational overhead. In contrast, lightweight models are more efficient but often fail to produce stable filtering and query-planning deci-sions. To achieve an efficient yet reliable integrator, we propose Trajectory Distillation . The core idea is to distill interactive trajectories produced by a strong teacher model into a lightweight student model KD(Eq. (1) ), so that the student can repro-duce the teacher’s stepwise integration decisions at a lower cost. 

Teacher trajectory generation. A trajectory ξ

records a sequence of interaction steps. Given a question x, an initial candidate triple set ˆT1, and an instruction prompt I, the teacher generates: 

ξ = (yt, o t+1 ) Lξ 

> t=1

∼ πT (· | x, ˆT1, I ), (7) where at step t the teacher produces an integration decision: 

yt = ( rt, ˜Tt, a t+1 ),

consisting of an integration rationale rt, the filtered core triple set ˜Tt, and the next-hop query at+1 . The retriever then returns the subsequent observation: 

ot+1 = ˆTt+1 = R(at+1 ),

which serves as a candidate set for the next itera-tion. 

Student supervision. Following prior works (Chen et al., 2023; Gou et al., 2023; Kang et al., 2025), we fine-tune the student to predict the teacher’s integration decisions, while treating re-trieval observations as context rather than supervi-sion targets: 

min  

> θ

−E x∼D train   

> τ∼πT(·| x,I )
> L

X

> t=1

log KD

 yt | x, I, τ <t ; θ

(8) where τ<t = {(yi, o i)}t−1

> i=1

. Dtrain denotes the train-ing set, πT (· | x, I ) is the teacher trajectory dis-tribution conditioned on input x and prompt I,

KD(·; θ) is the student model parameterized by 

θ, and Lτ is the length of trajectory τ . At each step 

t, the student predicts the reasoning trace rt, the fil-tered triples tt, and the next query at, conditioned on x and the trajectory history τ<t .After distillation, KD can execute the same in-tegration loop by consistently selecting salient triples ( ˜Tt) and synthesizing next-hop queries (at+1 ) across iterations, while remaining substan-tially more efficient than the teacher. 

4 Experiment 

4.1 Datasets and Metrics 

We evaluate our method on three multi-hop QA benchmarks: HotpotQA (Yang et al., 2018), 

2WikiMultiHopQA (2WikiMQA ) (Ho et al., 2020), and MuSiQue (Trivedi et al., 2022). For each dataset, we randomly selected 1000 multi-hop questions for evaluation in the validation set as done in previous work (Trivedi et al., 2023). To create a more rigorous and realistic retrieval setting, we followed the IRCoT (Trivedi et al., 2023) set-tings and merged all supported and unsupported paragraphs from the selected questions in each dataset to build the retrieval database. We use Exact Match (EM) and F1 as evaluation metrics, which are the standard metrics for these datasets. More details can be found in Appendix B. 

4.2 Baselines 

We propose a simple and efficient Iterative Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework, which we mainly compare with the iterative RAG method. Specifically, it mainly includes the following categories of RAG methods: (i) NativeRAG (Lewis et al., 2020), which follows a retrieval-generation paradigm and generates answers based on documents retrieved once.

In the main experiment, all iterative RAG methods are set to a maximum of 4 iteration steps, and the retriever was used to retrieve the top 10 documents for each question for model inference.

Trajectory Distillation. Using Qwen-max-2025-01-25 as the teacher model, we apply CIRAG to generate 3,000 complete reasoning trajectories from the training sets of HotpotQA (Yang et al., 2018), 2WikiMultihopQA (Ho et al., 2020), and MuSiQue (Trivedi et al., 2022). We fine-tune Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct as the student model utiliz-ing Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) (Hu et al., 2022). Further training configurations and implementation details are provided in Appendix B.4. 

4.4 Main Results 

Table 1 reports the main experimental results on three standard MHQA benchmarks. Over-all, CIRAG consistently outperforms all baselines across varying model scales. We make the fol-lowing key observations: (1) Compared with text-based iRAG methods, CIRAG improves perfor-mance by an average of 4.3% (F1) and 4.9% (EM) on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct. Notably, KiRAG, de-spite optimizing only the triple-retrieval compo-nent, remains competitive with stronger text-based approaches, e.g., MetaRAG and DualRAG. These results suggest that triples serve as finer-grained re-2WikiMQA HotpotQA MuSiQue

trieval units than full passages, enabling more accu-rate, stable iterative retrieval, which ultimately ben-efits QA performance. (2) Compared with triple-based iRAG methods, CIRAG achieves an average gains of 10.3% (F1) and 11.6%(EM) with Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct. These improvements validate our de-sign, yielding a better balance between structured precision and semantic completeness. The history-conditioned integration step mitigates the single-path bias of greedy linear expansion, while match-ing the context granularity to the question require-ments. (3) Figure 3 reports the Granularity Distri-bution on 2WikiMQA and MuSiQue. We observe that triples dominate the cascade, accounting for 76.3% on 2WikiMQA and 57.3% on MuSiQue. This indicates that most multi-hop questions can be resolved with compact relational triples, allowing to avoid unnecessary noise. Meanwhile, the dis-tribution shifts with dataset difficulty: in the more challenging MuSiQue dataset, the usage of coarser granularities is higher compared to 2WikiMQA. This contrast highlights the heterogeneous granu-larity demanded by different questions. Overall, these two observations confirm the rationale of our method, which can remain at low-noise triples when sufficient, yet reliably escalate to sentences or passages when additional context is required. (4) To verify the effectiveness of CIRAG, we re-port additional results under different retrievers and backbones in Appendix C.1.

2WikiMQA and MuSiQue, w/o Triple + Sentence underperform the others, suggesting that longer contexts introduce distracting noise; in contrast, passages are more effective on HotpotQA, indicat-ing a higher need for paragraph-level context to recover bridging evidence. This contrast highlights heterogeneous granularity demands in multi-hop QA. Across all datasets, two-level cascades con-sistently outperform single-granularity baselines, showing that cascading can expand context when necessary while avoiding redundant context injec-tion. CIRAG achieves the best overall F1/EM, con-firming the benefit of full cascaded expansion. We further compare performance at each cascade stage with its single-granularity counterpart in Figure 4 . The cascade improves F1/EM consistently at every granularity, indicating that on-demand expansion selects more suitable evidence for different ques-tions and yields more reliable QA performance. 

Effect of Trajectory Distillation To assess the impact of Trajectory Distillation (TD) on the Inte-gration Phase , we implement a variant, w/o TD, where the distilled model KD is replaced by a frozen Qwen-2.5-7B base model. As shown in Table 2, removing TD results in a significant degra-dation in QA performance. The decline is further elucidated by the granularity distribution in Fig-10 15 20 25

ure 5. The utilization ratio of triples in the cascaded process markedly decreases, while the incidence of passages and default (where no matching granu-larity is found) surges. This implies a substantial deterioration in the quality of the core triple set retrieved by the ICI loop, which directly impairs downstream generation. These findings substanti-ate the critical role of TD in endowing the model with the capability to discriminate core triples and orchestrate multi-hop queries. 

Effect of Reranker To assess the impact of the reranker, we introduce a variant, w/o reranker, which treats all triples extracted from retrieved documents as candidate triples. As shown in Ta-ble 2, this variant achieves comparable perfor-mance across all datasets, validating the effective-ness of the Integration Phase in identifying relevant triples. 

4.6 Efficiency Analysis 

We evaluate the efficiency of CIRAG compared to baseline methods. To ensure a fair comparison, both CIRAG and the baselines utilize the identi-cal retriever for document retrieval and employ the same underlying model as the reasoning compo-nent. Drawing inspiration from prior work (Fang et al., 2025), CIRAG extracts and caches knowl-edge triples offline to minimize online computa-tional overhead. To quantify the impact of these pre-computed triples, we introduce a variant named CIRAG (Online), which performs dynamic triple extraction during the iterative retrieval process. Hardware configurations. Figure 6 illustrates the average inference latency versus F1 score on the 2WikiMQA test set. The results indicate that: (1) Compared to CIRAG (Online), the offline pre-computation significantly reduces inference latency with negligible perfor-mance degradation, validating the efficiency ben-

efits of our caching strategy. (2) CIRAG achieves higher F1 scores while maintaining relatively low latency, demonstrating that our approach enhances QA accuracy without introducing substantial com-putational costs. (3) Overall, CIRAG strikes a supe-rior balance between effectiveness and efficiency, characterized by lower latency and higher F1 scores compared to baselines. 

4.7 Other QA Tasks 

To evaluate generalization, we conducted addi-tional experiments on a multi-hop QA dataset, We-bQA (Berant et al., 2013), and a single-hop QA dataset, NQ (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019). As shown in Table 4, CIRAG outperforms all baselines on WebQA and NQ, demonstrating strong generaliza-tion across QA settings. 

4.8 Case Study 

We conduct a case study in Appendix D to verify the effectiveness of our method. 

5 Conclusion 

We propose CIRAG, a two-module iRAG frame-work for multi-hop QA that integrates triple-based retrieval with adaptive multi-granularity generation. An Iterative Construction-Integration module dis-tills core triples and plans next-hop queries to mit-igate greedy reasoning and retrieval noise, while an Adaptive Cascaded Generation module dynami-cally expands context from triples to sentences and passages as needed. We further introduce Trajec-tory Distillation to enhance the integration capabil-ity of lightweight models. Experiments on MHQA benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements over iRAG baselines. In the future, we will ex-plore lightweight routing for efficient granularity selection. Limitations 

Our framework has two main limitations. First, the Construction Phase depends on prompt-based open IE; in specialized domains or when relations are highly implicit, the extractor may miss key triples, limiting downstream integration. Future work could improve extraction via domain-adaptive training or prompt optimization. Second, the cas-caded generation incurs extra latency due to sequen-tial granularity checks. While Trajectory Distilla-tion reduces integration cost, generation overhead remains. A potential improvement is to develop a lightweight granularity router that directly selects the appropriate context level, which could further accelerate inference.

B Experimental Details 

B.1 Datasets 

In our experiments, we employ four multi-hop QA datasets: HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHopQA, MuSiQue, WebQuestions (WebQA), and one single-hop QA dataset: Natural Questions (NQ). For HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHopQA, and MuSiQue, we construct the retrieval corpus by following ex-actly the same procedure as Trivedi et al. (2023). For WebQA and NQ, we use the corpus version released with DPR. To control evaluation cost, for each question in WebQA and NQ, we include all annotated supporting documents and additionally sample up to 10 non-supporting documents. For datasets with public test sets (WebQA and NQ), we randomly sample 500 test questions for evaluation. For datasets without public test sets (HotpotQA, 2WikiMultiHopQA, and MuSiQue), we randomly sample 1,000 questions from the de-velopment set as our test split and report perfor-mance on this subset. Since these three datasets are also used for training, we further randomly sample 1,000 questions from each original training set to form the training split used in our experiments. 

B.2 Metrics Details 

Exact Match (EM) provides the strictest criterion, assigning a score of 1 only when the predicted answer exactly matches the ground truth and 0 otherwise. The F1 score measures token-level similarity by computing the harmonic mean of Precision and Recall, where Precision reflects the proportion of predicted tokens that are correct, and Recall de-notes the proportion of reference tokens success-fully retrieved. We follow evaluation metrics from MuSiQue (Trivedi et al., 2022) to calculate F1 scores for the final answer. 

B.3 Baselines 

For IRCoT and FLARE, we use the implementa-tions provided by DualRAG (Cheng et al., 2025). For other models, we adapt the official implemen-tations released by the authors to match our experi-mental setting. For a fair comparison, CIRAG and all baselines use the same retriever to access the same corpus and share the same backbone LLM for reasoning and answer generation. For meth-ods that require training but do not provide public checkpoints, we reproduce training by following the authors’ released data-generation pipelines to construct the training set, and we use the same ini-tial training split as CIRAG. When applicable, we align the training recipe (e.g., optimization settings and hyperparameters) with the original papers as closely as possible under our hardware constraints. B.4 Training and Hyperparameter Details Training Details. We fine-tune student models using parameter-efficient tuning with LoRA (rank 64) (Hu et al., 2022). models are fine-tuned for 2 epochs using a batch size of 2 and a learning rate of 2 * 10 −4. Experiments are conducted using four NVIDIA A6000 48GB GPUs,with a total training time of approximately 3 hours. 

Implementation and Hyperparameter Details. 

Throughout the experiments, we set the maxi-mum number of iterative steps L to 4. The de-tails of each component in our CIRAG are out-lined as follows: For the Retriever model, we use either bge-Small-env1.5 (Xiao et al., 2024) or nvidia/NVEmbed-v2 (Lee et al., 2024) to re-trieve documents and rerank triples. The number of retrieved documents per iteration (i.e., K) is 10 .The number of candidate triples per iteration (i.e., 

N ) is 30 . For the Backbone model, we try differ-ent LLMs, including Llama3 (Dubey et al., 2024), Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct, and Qwen-max-2025-01-25 (Yang et al., 2024) as the backbone of our frame-work and all baselines. We set the temperature to 0 when calling the API of Qwen-max and use greedy decoding for other models to avoid random sampling (Renze, 2024). We mainly report the performance of using Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct and Qwen-max-2025-01-25 (Yang et al., 2024) as the Backbone. Hardware configurations: All experi-ments are conducted on the same hardware envi-ronment equipped with an Intel Xeon Gold 6326 CPU (2.90GHz, 32 cores) and an NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPU. 

C Additional Experimental Results and Analysis 

C.1 Using Different Retrievers and Readers 

To validate the effectiveness of CIRAG, we pro-vide additional results using different retrievers and a backbone model. Specifically, we replace the nvidia/NVEmbed-v2 Retriever with bge-Small-env1.5 Retriever for retrieving documents from the corpus and the other components remain un-changed. The corresponding QA performance is presented in Table 6, respectively. The re-sults are consistent with those obtained using thenvidia/NVEmbed-v2 Retriever, demonstrating the adaptability and effectiveness of our CIRAG across different retriever models.

different LLM architectures, we also conducted experiments on other open-source models (Llama-3-8B-Instruct). The results are shown in Table 5. These experimental results indicate that our method is also applicable to other LLM architectures, demonstrating robust performance across different models. 

C.2 Effect of the Number of Candidate Triples 

During the construction phase of CIRAG, the reranker retrieves the top-N triples most relevant to the current query, which are treated as the candidate triple set. To study the sensitivity to N , we vary 

N from 10 to 100. Figure 7 reports the QA perfor-mance under different N values, over 3,000 ques-tions sampled from three multi-hop QA datasets (the same as in the main experiment). Overall, CIRAG exhibits low sensitivity to N : both F1 and EM remain largely stable, with fluctuations below 2% across the tested range. This robustness is con-sistent with our integration module, which refines the candidate set into a compact core triple set by leveraging the accumulated history, thereby miti-2 4 6 8

C.3 Effect of the number of iterative steps L 

Figure 8 reports the QA performance of CIRAG and the iRAG baseline on our 2WikiMQA test set under different maximum iteration steps L. As L

increases, the performance of methods generally improves in the first few steps and then plateaus. Notably, CIRAG CIRAG achieves optimal perfor-mance at any value of L and already stabilizes at 

L = 2 , indicating that it can achieve strong ac-curacy with fewer rounds and thus improves effi-ciency. 

D Case Study 

We conducted several case studies to analyze the effectiveness of our method. The results show that DualRAG can dynamically retrieve information when additional knowledge is required, enabling efficient multi-hop reasoning with minimal itera-tions. Detailed case study examples are illustrated in Table 7. Case Study Question : Which film has the director who is older, God’S Gift To Women or Aldri Annet Enn Bråk?

Knowledge Triples: Figure 10: Prompt used for extracting knowledge triples. Prompt Used for Integration Phase 

Instruction : Your task is to loop through collecting facts to solve the query until enough facts are collected. You must plan to continue in a series of steps, looping as follows:[[ ## fact_before_filter ## ]]{fact_before_filter}[[ ## thought ## ]]{thought}[[ ## fact_after_filter ## ]]{fact_after_filter} [[ ## question ## ]] {question} sequence. In each step, in the [[ ## fact_before_filter ## ]] section, this is the collection of facts that need to be filtered to solve the previous problem. In the [[ ## thought ## ]] section, only use the information from the facts before filtering, briefly analyze the contribution of the facts to the problem, and list useful facts. Based on the analysis, determine whether the original problem can be solved. If it cannot be solved, analyze what additional information is needed and raise new questions. In the [[ ## fact_after_filter ## ]] section, if there are no relevant facts, return an empty list:{ "fact": [] }.In the [[ ## question ## ]] section, you need to use the filtered facts to propose the next problem that still needs to be solved. If the facts collected in the previous rounds are sufficient to answer the original query, output <no question> as the end to terminate the loop.
